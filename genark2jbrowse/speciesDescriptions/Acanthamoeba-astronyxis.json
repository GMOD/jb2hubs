  "description": "Acanthamoeba astronyxis is a free-living, opportunistic amoeba that belongs to the genus Acanthamoeba. It is a microscopic, single-celled eukaryotic organism commonly found in various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and air.\n\nThe defining characteristic of A. astronyxis is the presence of distinctive, star-shaped (astronyxis) acanthopodia, which are slender, spike-like projections from the cell surface. These acanthopodia are used for locomotion and prey capture.\n\nA. astronyxis exhibits a dimorphic life cycle, alternating between a actively feeding and dividing trophozoite stage and a dormant, encysted stage. The trophozoite stage is typically 20-30 micrometers in size and possesses a nucleus with a prominent nucleolus.\n\nThis species is known to be an opportunistic pathogen, capable of causing rare but serious infections in humans, such as Acanthamoeba keratitis, a sight-threatening eye infection, and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis, a rare and often fatal central nervous system infection.\n\nDue to its ability to form cysts, A. astronyxis can survive in harsh environmental conditions and is resistant to many disinfectants, making it a potential public health concern, particularly in water-related activities and medical settings.",
