  "description": "Acanthamoeba sp. SK_2022c is a species of free-living amoeba that belongs to the genus Acanthamoeba. Acanthamoeba is a genus of ubiquitous protozoans that are found in a wide range of environments, including soil, water, and air.\n\nAcanthamoeba sp. SK_2022c is a single-celled eukaryotic organism that exhibits an amoeboid form during its trophozoite stage, characterized by the presence of pseudopodia or acanthopodia, which are slender, spine-like projections that aid in locomotion and prey capture. The amoeba reproduces asexually through the formation of cysts, which are dormant, resilient forms that can withstand unfavorable environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, desiccation, and the presence of disinfectants.\n\nAs a free-living amoeba, Acanthamoeba sp. SK_2022c can be found in various aquatic and terrestrial environments and can potentially cause opportunistic infections in humans, such as Acanthamoeba keratitis, a severe eye infection, and Acanthamoeba granulomatous encephalitis, a rare and often fatal brain infection.\n\nThe specific characteristics and ecological roles of Acanthamoeba sp. SK_2022c may vary from other Acanthamoeba species and require further scientific investigation and classification.",
