  "description": "Acanthisitta chloris, commonly known as the rifleman or titipounamu, is a small passerine bird endemic to New Zealand. It is the only living member of the family Acanthisittidae, a group of ancient, diminutive birds that are unique to New Zealand.\n\nThe rifleman is a diminutive bird, measuring around 8-9 cm in length and weighing approximately 6-7 grams. It has a distinctive stout, pointed bill and short, rounded wings. The plumage is olive-green on the upper parts, with a white or pale buff underside. Males and females are similar in appearance, with the males having a slightly more vibrant coloration.\n\nRiflemen are known for their agile and acrobatic movements, often hopping and climbing along tree trunks and branches in search of small insects, spiders, and other invertebrates, which make up their primary diet. They are cavity-nesting birds, building their nests in natural cavities or crevices in trees, logs, or rock faces.\n\nThe rifleman is considered a taonga (treasure) species by the indigenous MƒÅori people of New Zealand and is an important part of the country's unique avian biodiversity. The species is currently classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it faces threats from habitat loss, predation by introduced mammals, and the impacts of climate change.",
