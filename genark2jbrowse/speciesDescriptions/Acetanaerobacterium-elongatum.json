  "description": "Acetanaerobacterium elongatum is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. It was isolated from a mesophilic, acetate-producing enrichment culture obtained from a municipal sewage sludge digester.\n\nThe cells of A. elongatum are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2.0-5.0 μm in length. They are motile and possess peritrichous flagella. The bacterium is capable of forming oval, terminal spores.\n\nPhysiologically, A. elongatum is an obligate anaerobe, growing optimally at 37°C and at a pH range of 6.5-7.5. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and xylose, as carbon and energy sources, producing acetate as the major fermentation end-product.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. elongatum belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and is closely related to other acetogenic, spore-forming bacteria within the family Clostridiaceae. This species plays a role in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter and the production of acetate in various anaerobic environments, such as sewage sludge digesters and sediments.",
