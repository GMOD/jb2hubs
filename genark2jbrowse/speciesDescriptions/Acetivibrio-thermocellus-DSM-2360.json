  "description": "Acetivibrio thermocellus DSM 2360 is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, cellulolytic bacterium. It belongs to the genus Acetivibrio, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nKey characteristics of Acetivibrio thermocellus DSM 2360:\n\n1. Anaerobic: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Thermophilic: It is a thermophilic organism, capable of growing optimally at high temperatures, typically around 55-60Â°C.\n\n3. Cellulolytic: It has the ability to degrade and utilize cellulose, a complex polysaccharide found in plant cell walls, as a carbon and energy source.\n\n4. Rod-shaped: The cells of Acetivibrio thermocellus DSM 2360 are rod-shaped in morphology.\n\n5. Spore-forming: This species can form endospores, which are resistant, dormant structures that allow the bacterium to survive adverse environmental conditions.\n\n6. Taxonomic affiliation: It is classified within the phylum Firmicutes, which is a large group of Gram-positive bacteria with low G+C content in their DNA.\n\nAcetivibrio thermocellus DSM 2360 has been isolated from various thermophilic environments, such as compost and hot springs, and has potential applications in biomass conversion and biofuel production due to its efficient cellulose-degrading capabilities.",
