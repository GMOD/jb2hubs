  "description": "Acetoanaerobium noterae is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium species. It was isolated from a deep subsurface environment in the Noterae region of Ukraine.\n\nSome key features of Acetoanaerobium noterae:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Straight to slightly curved rods, 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2.0-4.0 μm in length.\n2. Spore formation: Able to form oval, subterminal spores.\n3. Metabolism: Obligately anaerobic, fermenting various carbohydrates and producing acetate as the major end-product.\n4. Temperature range: Grows optimally at temperatures between 37-40°C.\n5. pH range: Grows well in a pH range of 6.5-8.0, with an optimum around 7.2.\n6. Habitat: Isolated from a deep subsurface environment, suggesting an adaptation to low-energy, nutrient-limited conditions.\n7. Phylogenetic affiliation: Belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and is closely related to other acetogenic, spore-forming anaerobes.\n\nThis species contributes to the understanding of microbial diversity and adaptations in deep subsurface ecosystems, which are considered important habitats for understanding the limits of life on Earth.",
