  "description": "Acetobacterium carbinolicum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Acetobacterium. It is a gram-positive, obligately anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of A. carbinolicum are rod-shaped and typically measure around 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. They are motile, with peritrichous flagella.\n\nThis species is known to be capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and mannitol, to produce acetic acid as the primary end-product. It can also utilize certain alcohols, such as ethanol and propanol, as carbon and energy sources.\n\nA. carbinolicum is considered an acetogenic bacterium, meaning it can perform the acetogenic pathway, which involves the reduction of carbon dioxide to acetate. This metabolic capability makes it an important player in the carbon cycle and the cycling of organic matter in anaerobic environments.\n\nThe natural habitats of A. carbinolicum include anaerobic sediments, biogas-producing reactors, and other anoxic, carbohydrate-rich environments. It has been isolated from various sources, including freshwater and marine sediments, as well as from the digestive tracts of some animals.",
