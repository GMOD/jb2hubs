  "description": "Acetomicrobium thermoterrenum DSM 13490 is a species of thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria that was isolated from a hot spring in China. Some key features of this species are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are irregular coccoid or short rod-shaped, approximately 0.8-1.5 μm in diameter.\n\n2. Temperature range: Grows optimally at 60-65°C, with a temperature range of 50-70°C.\n\n3. pH range: Grows optimally at pH 6.5-7.0, with a pH range of 5.5-8.0.\n\n4. Metabolism: Chemoorganotrophic, fermenting various carbohydrates and proteinaceous substrates to produce acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the main end products.\n\n5. Phylogeny: Belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Thermoanaerobacteriales, and family Thermoanaerobacteriaceae.\n\n6. Habitat: Isolated from a hot spring in Tengchong, Yunnan Province, China, and is likely adapted to thrive in geothermal environments.\n\n7. Significance: As a thermophilic anaerobe, Acetomicrobium thermoterrenum DSM 13490 may have potential applications in bioremediation, biofuel production, or other biotechnological processes that require high-temperature, anaerobic conditions.",
