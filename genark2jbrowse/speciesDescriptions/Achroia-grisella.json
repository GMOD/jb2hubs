  "description": "Achroia grisella, commonly known as the lesser wax moth, is a small moth species belonging to the family Pyralidae. This moth is primarily found in regions with a temperate climate, including Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nThe adult Achroia grisella has a wingspan of approximately 15-20 millimeters. Its wings are typically gray or grayish-brown in color, with a mottled pattern that helps the moth camouflage itself when at rest. The body is also gray or grayish-brown, and the antennae are slender and thread-like.\n\nThe larvae of Achroia grisella, commonly referred to as \"wax worms,\" are the primary pests of this species. These larvae feed on the wax, pollen, and stored honey within beehives, which can cause significant damage to the hive and its contents. The larvae are typically white or creamy-white in color, with a cylindrical body and a distinct head capsule.\n\nAchroia grisella undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The life cycle of this species can vary depending on environmental conditions, but typically, the eggs hatch into larvae, which then spin cocoons and transform into pupae before emerging as adult moths.\n\nThis species is known to be a significant pest for beekeepers, as the wax worm larvae can cause extensive damage to beehives and their contents. However, the lesser wax moth also plays a role in the natural ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators, such as birds and other insects.",
