  "description": "Achromobacter aegrifaciens is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Achromobacter. It was first isolated from the sputum of a patient with cystic fibrosis.\n\nThe cells of Achromobacter aegrifaciens are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They do not produce any pigments, hence the name \"Achromobacter,\" which means \"without color.\"\n\nAchromobacter aegrifaciens is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it has been associated with various clinical infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, such as cystic fibrosis. It has been reported to cause respiratory tract infections, bacteremia, and other types of infections.\n\nThis species is known to be resistant to multiple antibiotics, which can make it challenging to treat infections caused by Achromobacter aegrifaciens. Further research is ongoing to better understand its epidemiology, virulence factors, and potential therapeutic strategies.",
