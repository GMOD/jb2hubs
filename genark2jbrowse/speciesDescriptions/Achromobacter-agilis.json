  "description": "Achromobacter agilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Achromobacter. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium. Achromobacter agilis is known to be a non-spore-forming and non-pigmented microorganism.\n\nThe cells of Achromobacter agilis are typically rod-shaped and can range in size from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 3.0 micrometers in length. The bacterium is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nAchromobacter agilis is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been isolated from various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and clinical samples. It has been associated with rare human infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. However, its clinical significance and pathogenic potential are still under investigation.\n\nThe identification and characterization of Achromobacter agilis rely on biochemical tests, as well as molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, for accurate species-level identification.",
