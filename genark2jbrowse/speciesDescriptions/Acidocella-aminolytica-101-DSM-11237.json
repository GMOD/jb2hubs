  "description": "Acidocella aminolytica 101 (DSM 11237) is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria. It belongs to the genus Acidocella, which is a member of the family Acetobacteraceae within the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nThis bacterium is characterized as an acidophilic and facultatively chemolithoautotrophic microorganism, meaning it can grow in acidic environments and utilize both organic and inorganic carbon sources for energy and carbon requirements. It is capable of oxidizing various organic compounds, including amino acids, as its sole carbon and energy source.\n\nAcidocella aminolytica 101 was originally isolated from an acidic, metal-contaminated environment and has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology due to its ability to tolerate and transform various organic and inorganic pollutants.",
