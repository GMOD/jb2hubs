  "description": "Acidovorax lacteus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Acidovorax. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Acidovorax lacteus is characterized by its ability to utilize lactic acid as a carbon and energy source, which is reflected in its species name \"lacteus\" meaning \"milk-white\" or \"milky.\"\n\nThis bacterium is typically found in environments where lactic acid is present, such as in dairy products, fermented foods, and wastewater treatment systems. Acidovorax lacteus plays a role in the degradation of lactic acid and can be involved in the production of various metabolites during these processes.\n\nThe cells of Acidovorax lacteus are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to move using polar flagella. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a neutral to slightly acidic pH range and moderate temperatures, typically between 25°C to 30°C.\n\nAcidovorax lacteus is considered a non-pathogenic bacterium and is not known to cause any significant human or animal diseases. However, its potential applications in biotechnology and environmental remediation processes are still being explored by researchers.",
