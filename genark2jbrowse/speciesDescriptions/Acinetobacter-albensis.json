  "description": "Acinetobacter albensis is a species of Gram-negative, non-motile, aerobic bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. It is a coccobacillus, meaning it has a short, rounded rod-like shape.\n\nAcinetobacter albensis was first isolated from soil samples collected in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C.\n\nThis species is known to be oxidase-negative and catalase-positive, which are common phenotypic characteristics within the Acinetobacter genus. Acinetobacter albensis can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, allowing it to thrive in diverse environmental conditions.\n\nGenetically, Acinetobacter albensis has a circular chromosome and its genome size is estimated to be around 3.8 to 4.2 million base pairs. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has confirmed its placement within the Acinetobacter genus.\n\nWhile the specific ecological roles and potential applications of Acinetobacter albensis are still under investigation, the identification and characterization of this species contribute to our understanding of the diversity and adaptability of bacteria in the environment.",
