  "description": "Acinetobacter faecalis is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. It is a coccobacillus, meaning it has a short, rounded, or oval shape.\n\nAcinetobacter faecalis is commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and water, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions.\n\nThe bacterium is known for its ability to survive in diverse environmental conditions and its potential to develop antimicrobial resistance. Acinetobacter faecalis has been associated with various clinical infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and wound infections, particularly in healthcare settings.\n\nTaxonomically, Acinetobacter faecalis is classified within the Acinetobacter genus, which is part of the Moraxellaceae family, which in turn belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria class of the Proteobacteria phylum.",
