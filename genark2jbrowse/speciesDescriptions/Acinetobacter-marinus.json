  "description": "Acinetobacter marinus is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile, coccobacillus bacteria. It was first isolated from seawater samples collected near the coast of South Korea.\n\nSome key characteristics of Acinetobacter marinus:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are coccobacillus-shaped, approximately 1-2 μm in length and 0.5-1 μm in width.\n\n2. Oxygen requirements: It is an aerobic bacterium, requiring oxygen for growth.\n\n3. Habitat and isolation: Acinetobacter marinus was originally isolated from seawater samples, indicating its natural habitat is the marine environment.\n\n4. Genetic features: Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Acinetobacter marinus is a distinct species within the genus Acinetobacter.\n\n5. Physiological properties: It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of carbon sources for energy and growth.\n\n6. Taxonomic classification: Acinetobacter marinus belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Gammaproteobacteria, order Pseudomonadales, and family Moraxellaceae.\n\nOverall, Acinetobacter marinus is a marine-adapted bacterium that has been isolated from seawater and demonstrates physiological adaptations to the marine environment.",
