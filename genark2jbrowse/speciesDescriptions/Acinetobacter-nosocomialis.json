  "description": "Acinetobacter nosocomialis is a species of Gram-negative, non-motile, aerobic, and coccobacillary bacterium. It is a member of the Acinetobacter genus, which is known for its ability to cause opportunistic infections, particularly in healthcare settings.\n\nAcinetobacter nosocomialis is primarily associated with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and urinary tract infections, often affecting immunocompromised patients or those with underlying medical conditions. It is considered an important pathogen due to its increasing antimicrobial resistance, making it challenging to treat effectively.\n\nThe bacterium is capable of surviving on various surfaces and equipment in the hospital environment, contributing to its ability to cause outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections. Identification and characterization of Acinetobacter nosocomialis rely on biochemical tests, molecular techniques, and advanced genomic analysis methods.\n\nUnderstanding the epidemiology, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of Acinetobacter nosocomialis is crucial for developing effective infection control strategies and appropriate therapeutic interventions in healthcare settings.",
