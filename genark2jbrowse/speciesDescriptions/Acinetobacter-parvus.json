  "description": "Acinetobacter parvus is a species of gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, and coccobacillary-shaped bacteria. It belongs to the genus Acinetobacter, which is a group of ubiquitous microorganisms found in various environmental niches, including soil, water, and on the skin of humans and animals.\n\nAcinetobacter parvus is characterized by its small cell size, typically ranging from 0.9 to 1.6 micrometers in length and 0.6 to 1.0 micrometers in width. It is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. The species is known to be catalase-positive and oxidase-negative, which are biochemical characteristics that help in its identification.\n\nAcinetobacter parvus has been isolated from various sources, including soil, water, and clinical samples. While it is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen, its clinical significance and potential for causing infections in humans or animals are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.",
