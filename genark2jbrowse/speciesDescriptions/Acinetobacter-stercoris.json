  "description": "Acinetobacter stercoris is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, coccobacillary bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. This species was first isolated from human fecal samples and is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota.\n\nAcinetobacter stercoris is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that can be found in various habitats, including soil, water, and the intestinal tracts of humans and animals. It is known for its ability to survive in diverse environmental conditions and its potential role in human health and disease.\n\nThe cells of Acinetobacter stercoris are typically short, rod-shaped, and measure approximately 1-2 micrometers in length. They are non-spore-forming and lack flagella, which contributes to their non-motile nature. The bacterium is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it has been associated with various clinical infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, and urinary tract infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nAcinetobacter stercoris is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota, and its presence in the human intestine may have both beneficial and potentially detrimental effects. Further research is ongoing to understand the specific roles and interactions of this bacterium within the complex gut ecosystem and its potential implications for human health.",
