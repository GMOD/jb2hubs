  "description": "Acinetobacter thermotolerans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccobacillus. This bacterium is known for its ability to tolerate and grow at relatively high temperatures, typically ranging from 20°C to 50°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 45°C.\n\nAcinetobacter thermotolerans is classified as a member of the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (Acb) complex, a group of closely related Acinetobacter species that share similar phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. This species has been isolated from various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and sewage treatment plants, as well as from clinical samples in some cases.\n\nThe genome of Acinetobacter thermotolerans has been partially sequenced, revealing insights into its genetic makeup and potential adaptations to its thermal-tolerant lifestyle. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying bacterial thermotolerance and their potential applications in biotechnology or environmental remediation.",
