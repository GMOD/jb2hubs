  "description": "Acipenser ruthenus, commonly known as the sterlet, is a species of sturgeon native to the Eurasian continent. It is a small to medium-sized freshwater fish that typically grows up to 1.2 meters in length and can live for over 50 years.\n\nThe sterlet is characterized by its elongated, torpedo-shaped body with a prominent snout and four barbels on the underside of the snout. Its body is covered in rows of bony plates called scutes, which provide protection and armor-like defense. The coloration of the sterlet ranges from dark olive-green to brownish-gray on the dorsal side, transitioning to a lighter, sometimes yellowish, color on the ventral side.\n\nSterlets are found in the rivers and lakes of central and eastern Europe, including the Danube, Volga, and Ural river basins. They are bottom-dwelling fish that primarily feed on benthic invertebrates, such as insect larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. Sterlets are known for their ability to jump out of the water, a behavior that is thought to be related to their migration patterns and spawning activities.\n\nThe sterlet is considered a valuable commercial and recreational fish species, and its meat and roe (caviar) are highly prized. However, due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution, the sterlet's population has declined in many parts of its natural range, leading to its classification as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
