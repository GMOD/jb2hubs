  "description": "Acomys cahirinus, commonly known as the Cairo spiny mouse, is a small rodent species belonging to the family Muridae. It is native to North Africa and the Middle East, ranging from Egypt to Israel and Jordan.\n\nThe Cairo spiny mouse is characterized by its distinctive spiny fur, which is a protective adaptation against predators. The spines are modified hairs that are made rigid by the deposition of keratin. The fur on the back is typically reddish-brown, while the underside is white or pale gray.\n\nThese mice are nocturnal and arboreal, spending much of their time foraging and moving among the branches and rocks of their arid, rocky habitats. They are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a variety of plant materials, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nAcomys cahirinus is known for its exceptional ability to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has adaptations that allow it to conserve water and thrive in areas with limited resources. These adaptations include the ability to enter torpor, a state of reduced metabolic activity, during periods of extreme heat or drought.\n\nReproduction in the Cairo spiny mouse is variable, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year. The gestation period is around 30 days, and the litter size typically ranges from 2 to 6 offspring.\n\nThe Cairo spiny mouse is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it is widely distributed and not currently facing significant threats to its population.",
