  "description": "Acropora digitifera, also known as the finger coral, is a species of scleractinian coral found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is a branching coral that forms colonies with finger-like projections, hence the common name.\n\nAcropora digitifera is a hermatypic (reef-building) coral, meaning it plays a crucial role in the formation and growth of coral reefs. The coral colony is composed of numerous individual polyps, which are small, soft-bodied animals that secrete a hard, calcium carbonate skeleton.\n\nThe colony's branches are typically long and slender, with a diameter ranging from 5 to 15 millimeters. The polyps are small, measuring only a few millimeters in size, and are arranged in rows along the branches. The coral's coloration can vary from shades of brown, yellow, or pink, depending on the symbiotic microalgae (zooxanthellae) present within the polyps.\n\nAcropora digitifera is an important reef-building species, contributing to the structure and biodiversity of coral reef ecosystems. It is found in shallow, tropical waters, typically at depths between 2 and 20 meters, and prefers areas with moderate to high water flow and low sedimentation.",
