  "description": "Actinacidiphila alni is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Actinobacteria class. It is a gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Actinacidiphila alni was isolated from the root nodules of the alder tree (Alnus spp.), a nitrogen-fixing plant, and is known to be associated with the nitrogen fixation process in these plants.\n\nThe cells of Actinacidiphila alni are typically rod-shaped and can form branched filaments. They are considered acidophilic, meaning they thrive in acidic environments, with an optimal growth pH range of 4.5 to 6.5. Actinacidiphila alni is a chemoheterotrophic organism, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential role in the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between alder trees and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Actinacidiphila alni may contribute to the nutrient cycling and soil fertility in alder-dominated ecosystems. Further research is ongoing to understand the ecological and functional significance of this actinobacterial species in the rhizosphere of alder plants.",
