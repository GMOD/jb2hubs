  "description": "Actinacidiphila guanduensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Actinobacteria class. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Guandu, China. The species is characterized as a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Actinacidiphila guanduensis is capable of growing under acidic conditions, with an optimal pH range of 4.0 to 6.0. Biochemical analysis has revealed that this species can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources and is able to produce various hydrolytic enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Actinacidiphila guanduensis is closely related to other Actinacidiphila species, forming a distinct clade within the Actinobacteria class. This species has been studied for its potential applications in various biotechnological processes due to its ability to thrive in acidic environments.",
