  "description": "Actinacidiphila yanglinensis is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in Yanglin County, Shaanxi Province, China. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of A. yanglinensis are coccoid to short rod-shaped, and they form pale yellow to orange-colored colonies on agar media. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 28-30Â°C, and it can grow at a pH range of 5.0-8.0, with a preference for slightly acidic conditions.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison has placed A. yanglinensis within the family Acidimicrobiaceae, and it is closely related to other acidophilic actinobacterial genera, such as Acidimicrobium and Ferrimicrobium.\n\nThis species is notable for its ability to tolerate and grow in acidic environments, which is an adaptive trait that likely enables it to thrive in soil habitats with low pH. Further research may uncover additional metabolic or ecological characteristics of A. yanglinensis that contribute to its environmental fitness and potential applications in various biotechnological or environmental processes.",
