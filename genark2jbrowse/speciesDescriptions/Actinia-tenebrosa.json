  "description": "Actinia tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark sea anemone, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal regions of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. This invertebrate marine organism belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, and order Actiniaria.\n\nThe dark sea anemone is characterized by its dark-colored column, typically ranging from deep brown to black in color. The column can reach up to 10 centimeters in height and is covered with numerous small, raised verrucae (warts) that help the anemone adhere to rocky substrates. The oral disc, which is the upper part of the anemone, is equipped with numerous tentacles that are used for capturing prey and for defense.\n\nActinia tenebrosa is a sessile organism, meaning it remains firmly attached to the substrate throughout its lifetime. It typically inhabits the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones, where it can be found clinging to rocks, boulders, and other hard surfaces. The dark sea anemone is an important component of the marine ecosystem, providing shelter and food for various species of small invertebrates and fish.\n\nThis species is known for its ability to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of the intertidal zone, such as exposure to air during low tide, fluctuations in temperature, and changes in salinity. Actinia tenebrosa is a relatively common and widespread species in its native range, contributing to the diversity and resilience of the coastal marine communities it inhabits.",
