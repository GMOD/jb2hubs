  "description": "Actinoallomurus liliacearum is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of a lily plant (Lilium sp.). It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Actinoallomurus liliacearum forms branched, vegetative hyphae and produces aerial mycelia, characteristic of the genus Actinoallomurus.\n\nThe cells of Actinoallomurus liliacearum are coccoid to short rod-shaped, and they range in size from 0.5 to 1.0 μm in width and 1.0 to 2.0 μm in length. The colonies of this species appear chalky white to pale yellow in color on agar media.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Actinoallomurus liliacearum belongs to the family Thermomonosporaceae within the order Actinomycetales. The species is known to produce several secondary metabolites, which may contribute to its ecological role in the rhizosphere environment.",
