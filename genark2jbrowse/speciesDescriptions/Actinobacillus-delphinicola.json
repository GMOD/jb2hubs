  "description": "Actinobacillus delphinicola is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacteria. It was first isolated from the respiratory tract of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and is considered a commensal organism in these marine mammals.\n\nThe cells of Actinobacillus delphinicola are small, coccobacillary in shape, and typically measure around 0.5-1.0 Î¼m in diameter. They are catalase-positive and oxidase-positive, and can ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, to produce acid as the main metabolic end-product.\n\nPhylogenetically, Actinobacillus delphinicola belongs to the family Pasteurellaceae within the order Pasteurellales. It is closely related to other Actinobacillus species that are commonly found in the upper respiratory tracts of various animal hosts, including livestock and companion animals.\n\nThe presence of Actinobacillus delphinicola in the respiratory tract of bottlenose dolphins is considered normal and does not typically cause any overt clinical signs or disease in the host. However, it may play a role in the overall respiratory microbiome and potentially contribute to the health and well-being of these marine mammals.",
