  "description": "Actinobacillus lignieresii is a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium that belongs to the family Pasteurellaceae. It is a member of the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal tract of various domestic animals, particularly ruminants such as cattle and sheep.\n\nThis species is considered an opportunistic pathogen and can cause disease in these animals under certain conditions. It is known to be involved in the development of various clinical conditions, including pneumonia, pleuritis, peritonitis, and abscesses in the lungs, liver, and other organs.\n\nActinobacillus lignieresii is a rod-shaped bacterium that is capable of growth on a variety of laboratory media. It is catalase-positive and oxidase-variable, and can ferment a range of carbohydrates. The bacterium is also capable of producing various virulence factors, such as capsular polysaccharides and endotoxins, which contribute to its pathogenicity.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of Actinobacillus lignieresii is important for the diagnosis, prevention, and management of the diseases it can cause in domestic animals, particularly in livestock production settings.",
