  "description": "Actinobacillus vicugnae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Actinobacillus. It is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium.\n\nActinobacillus vicugnae was first isolated from the respiratory tract of vicuñas (Vicugna vicugna), a small South American camelid species. It is considered a commensal bacterium, meaning it typically resides in the host without causing any harm.\n\nThe bacterium is known to be part of the normal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract of vicuñas, which are wild relatives of the domesticated alpaca and llama. It plays a role in the natural ecosystem and interactions within the host's microbiome.\n\nActinobacillus vicugnae has been studied to understand its ecology, potential interactions with the host, and its role in the overall health and well-being of vicuñas. Further research on this species may provide insights into the diversity and dynamics of the respiratory microbiome in camelid species.",
