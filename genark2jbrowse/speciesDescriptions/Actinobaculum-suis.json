  "description": "Actinobaculum suis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium that is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.\n\nThe cells of Actinobaculum suis are typically rod-shaped and can form branching filaments. They are non-motile and do not produce any pigments. The bacterium is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various infections in pigs, such as abscesses, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.\n\nActinobaculum suis is a slow-growing bacterium and requires specific growth conditions, such as the presence of fatty acids and amino acids, for optimal growth in the laboratory. It is often isolated from clinical samples using specialized culture media and techniques.\n\nThe identification and characterization of Actinobaculum suis are important for understanding its role in porcine health and disease, as well as for developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies in veterinary medicine.",
