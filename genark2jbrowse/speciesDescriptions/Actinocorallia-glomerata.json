  "description": "Actinocorallia glomerata is a species of coral that belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, and order Scleractinia. It is a reef-building coral, meaning it has the ability to secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton that forms the structure of coral reefs.\n\nActinocorallia glomerata is a colonial coral, with individual polyps living together in a compact, mounded growth form. The polyps have tentacles that are used to capture small prey, such as plankton, from the surrounding water. The coral's skeleton is typically white or light in color, and the polyps may be various shades of brown, green, or yellow.\n\nThis species is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, primarily in the Indo-Pacific region. It is often observed growing on shallow reef environments, where it plays a crucial role in the overall ecosystem by providing habitat and shelter for a diverse array of marine organisms.",
