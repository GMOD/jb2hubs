  "description": "Actinokineospora guangxiensis is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil collected in Guangxi, China. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Cells of A. guangxiensis are coccoid to short rod-shaped and form branched substrate mycelia. The optimum growth conditions for this species are at a temperature of 28-30Â°C and a pH between 7.0-8.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has placed A. guangxiensis within the genus Actinokineospora, which is a member of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. This species has the ability to hydrolyze starch and degrade cellulose, and it displays antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria and fungi, suggesting potential applications in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.",
