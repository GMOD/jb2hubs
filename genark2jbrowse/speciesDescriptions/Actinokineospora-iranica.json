  "description": "Actinokineospora iranica is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from a soil sample collected in Iran. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. \n\nThe cells of Actinokineospora iranica are short rods or coccoid in shape, and they form branched substrate mycelium. The optimal growth conditions for this species are at a temperature of 28-30Â°C and a pH range of 7.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Actinokineospora iranica belongs to the genus Actinokineospora, which is a member of the family Nocardioidaceae within the order Actinomycetales.\n\nThis species is of interest due to its potential for producing novel secondary metabolites or bioactive compounds that may have useful applications in various fields, such as medicine or biotechnology. Further studies on its physiological, biochemical, and genomic characteristics could provide insights into its ecological role and biotechnological potential.",
