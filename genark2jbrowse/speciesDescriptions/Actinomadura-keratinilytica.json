  "description": "Actinomadura keratinilytica is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil samples. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium. The cells of A. keratinilytica are typically rod-shaped and exhibit a characteristic branched mycelial growth pattern, which is a common feature among actinobacteria.\n\nThe distinctive feature of this species is its ability to degrade and utilize keratin as a carbon and energy source. Keratin is a structural protein that is a major component of hair, nails, feathers, and other integumentary structures of many organisms. A. keratinilytica possesses a specialized set of enzymes that allow it to break down and metabolize keratin, making it a potential candidate for applications in the bioremediation of keratin-rich waste materials.\n\nTaxonomically, A. keratinilytica belongs to the genus Actinomadura, which is a member of the family Thermomonosporaceae within the order Actinomycetales. The species was first described and named in 2001, based on its unique physiological and genetic characteristics.",
