  "description": "Actinomyces culturomici is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Actinomyces. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming actinobacterium. Actinomyces culturomici was first isolated from a human clinical sample and was subsequently described as a new species in 2018.\n\nThe cells of Actinomyces culturomici are typically rod-shaped and can form branching filaments. They are capable of growing on various laboratory media, such as blood agar and thioglycollate broth. Biochemical analysis has shown that Actinomyces culturomici is able to ferment a range of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has revealed that Actinomyces culturomici is most closely related to other Actinomyces species, such as Actinomyces turicensis and Actinomyces massiliensis. However, it can be distinguished from these related species based on its unique phenotypic and genomic characteristics.\n\nThe clinical significance and potential pathogenic role of Actinomyces culturomici in human infections are still under investigation, as it has been primarily isolated from clinical samples without a clear association with specific disease conditions.",
