  "description": "Actinomyces howellii is a species of gram-positive, anaerobic, and filamentous bacteria that belongs to the Actinomycetales order. It was first isolated from the oral cavity of humans and is considered a member of the normal human oral microbiome.\n\nThe cells of Actinomyces howellii are non-spore-forming, and they exhibit a branching, mycelial growth pattern characteristic of the Actinomyces genus. The colonies formed by this species on culture media are typically chalky white or cream-colored, and they may have a granular or rough appearance.\n\nActinomyces howellii is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it has been associated with various human infections, including actinomycosis, a chronic, granulomatous disease that can affect different parts of the body, such as the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen. However, its role in human disease is not fully understood, and it is often found in mixed infections with other microbial species.\n\nThe identification and characterization of Actinomyces howellii rely on a combination of phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular techniques, such as colony morphology, Gram staining, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.",
