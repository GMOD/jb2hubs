  "description": "Actinomyces marseillensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human clinical sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the genus Actinomyces, which are Gram-positive, anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacteria.\n\nThe cells of A. marseillensis are typically rod-shaped and can form branching filaments. They are catalase-positive and show positive results for the production of acid from various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. marseillensis is closely related to other Actinomyces species, but it can be distinguished from them based on its unique biochemical and genetic characteristics. The species was formally described and named in 2016 after its place of isolation, Marseille.\n\nA. marseillensis has been primarily isolated from human clinical samples, and its exact role and significance in human health and disease are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand its ecology, pathogenic potential, and possible applications in biotechnology or medicine.",
