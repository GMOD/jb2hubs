  "description": "Actinomyces succiniciruminis is a species of anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria that belongs to the genus Actinomyces. This bacterium was first isolated from the rumen (one of the compartments of the stomach) of a Simmental cow.\n\nThe key features of Actinomyces succiniciruminis are:\n\n1. Morphology: It forms non-spore-forming, non-motile, branched filamentous cells.\n\n2. Growth requirements: Actinomyces succiniciruminis is an anaerobic bacterium, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth. It can grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 42°C, with an optimum growth temperature of 37°C.\n\n3. Metabolic capabilities: This species is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, and can produce succinic acid as a major end-product of its metabolism.\n\n4. Ecological role: Actinomyces succiniciruminis is believed to play a role in the breakdown of plant materials and the production of volatile fatty acids in the rumen of ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, contributing to their overall digestive processes.\n\n5. Taxonomic classification: Actinomyces succiniciruminis belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria, class Actinomycetia, order Actinomycetales, and family Actinomycetaceae.\n\nThis species was first described in 2010 based on the analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence and other phenotypic characteristics.",
