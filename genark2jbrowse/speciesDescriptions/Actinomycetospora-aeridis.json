  "description": "Actinomycetospora aeridis is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from the leaf of an orchid plant (Aerides sp.) collected in Thailand. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Actinomycetospora aeridis are short rods or coccoid in shape, with a diameter of 0.4-0.6 μm and a length of 0.8-1.2 μm. The colonies on agar media are circular, convex, and yellowish-white in color.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicates that Actinomycetospora aeridis belongs to the family Thermomonosporaceae within the order Actinomycetales. It is closely related to other members of the genus Actinomycetospora, which are known to be associated with various plant species.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Actinomycetospora aeridis include a temperature range of 25-35°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0. It is able to hydrolyze starch and casein, but cannot reduce nitrate or liquefy gelatin.\n\nOverall, Actinomycetospora aeridis is a relatively recently described actinobacterial species that was isolated from a plant host and may play a role in plant-microbe interactions or have potential biotechnological applications.",
