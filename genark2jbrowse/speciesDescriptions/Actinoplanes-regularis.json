  "description": "Actinoplanes regularis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Actinoplanes genus, which is a member of the Actinomycetales order within the Actinobacteria class. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium.\n\nActinoplanes regularis is characterized by its regular, spherical sporangia that are typically arranged in clusters. The spores produced within the sporangia are non-motile. The colonies of this species on agar media are typically powdery or chalky in appearance, with a range of colors from white to gray or brown.\n\nThis bacterium is known to be found in soil environments and has the ability to degrade various organic compounds, including some recalcitrant materials. Actinoplanes regularis has been studied for its potential in biotechnological applications, such as the production of industrially relevant enzymes or the bioconversion of specific substrates.\n\nOverall, Actinoplanes regularis is a well-studied representative of the Actinoplanes genus, contributing to our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of actinobacterial species in natural environments.",
