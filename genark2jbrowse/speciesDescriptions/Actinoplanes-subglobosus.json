  "description": "Actinoplanes subglobosus is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Actinoplanes, which is a member of the Actinobacteria class. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Actinoplanes subglobosus are typically subglobose (slightly spherical) in shape, measuring around 1-2 Î¼m in diameter. They form branched, substrate and aerial mycelia, which can differentiate into spherical to subglobose spores.\n\nThis species is known to be found in soil and other terrestrial environments. It is characterized by its ability to grow on a variety of carbon sources and its production of secondary metabolites, including some with potential pharmaceutical or industrial applications.\n\nActinoplanes subglobosus is considered an important member of the Actinoplanes genus due to its versatile metabolic capabilities and its potential as a source of novel bioactive compounds.",
