  "description": "Acutalibacter caecimuris is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum, specifically within the Lachnospiraceae family. It was first isolated from the cecum of laboratory mice.\n\nThe cells of Acutalibacter caecimuris are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Acutalibacter caecimuris is closely related to other members of the Lachnospiraceae family, which are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract of various mammals, including humans.\n\nThis bacterium is considered an anaerobic, chemoorganotrophic organism, meaning it requires organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy, and it grows best in the absence of oxygen. The specific metabolic capabilities and ecological roles of Acutalibacter caecimuris within the gut microbiome are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the distribution, physiology, and potential interactions of Acutalibacter caecimuris with its host and other gut microbiome members, as well as its potential relevance in health and disease.",
