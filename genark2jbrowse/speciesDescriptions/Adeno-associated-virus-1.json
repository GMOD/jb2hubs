  "description": "Adeno-associated virus-1 (AAV-1) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Dependovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It is considered a helper-dependent virus, as it requires the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus or herpes simplex virus, to complete its replication cycle.\n\nThe AAV-1 genome is approximately 4.7 kilobases in length and consists of two major open reading frames (ORFs) â€“ the rep gene, which encodes proteins involved in viral replication and gene expression, and the cap gene, which encodes the viral capsid proteins. The viral capsid is composed of three viral proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) and has an icosahedral symmetry.\n\nAAV-1 has a broad tissue tropism and can infect a variety of cell types, including muscle, liver, and central nervous system cells. Once inside the host cell, the viral genome integrates into the host cell's DNA, primarily at a specific site on chromosome 19, known as the AAVS1 locus.\n\nDue to its unique properties, such as its ability to integrate into the host genome and its low immunogenicity, AAV-1 has been extensively studied as a potential vector for gene therapy applications, particularly in the treatment of genetic disorders and various diseases.",
