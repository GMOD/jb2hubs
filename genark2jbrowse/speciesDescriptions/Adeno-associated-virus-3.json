  "description": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) -3 is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Dependoparvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. AAV-3 is one of the serotypes of the adeno-associated virus, which are known for their ability to infect a wide range of human and animal cells.\n\nThe genome of AAV-3 consists of approximately 4.7 kilobases (kb) of single-stranded DNA, which encodes for the essential viral proteins necessary for its replication and packaging. These proteins include the Rep proteins, which are involved in viral DNA replication and integration, and the Cap proteins, which form the viral capsid structure.\n\nAAV-3 is considered a \"helper-dependent\" virus, meaning that it requires the presence of a helper virus, such as an adenovirus or a herpes virus, to complete its replication cycle. In the absence of a helper virus, AAV-3 can establish a latent infection in the host cell, integrating its genome into the host's DNA and remaining dormant until the helper virus is present.\n\nDue to its unique properties, AAV-3 has been extensively studied for its potential use in gene therapy applications. The virus's ability to infect a wide range of cell types, combined with its non-pathogenic nature and low immunogenicity, make it a promising candidate for the delivery of therapeutic genes to target tissues or cells.",
