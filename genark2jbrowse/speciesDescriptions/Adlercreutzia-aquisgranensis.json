  "description": "Adlercreutzia aquisgranensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia. It was first isolated from the feces of a healthy human individual living in Aachen, Germany.\n\nThe cells of A. aquisgranensis are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that A. aquisgranensis is closely related to other members of the genus Adlercreutzia, which are anaerobic, saccharolytic bacteria commonly found in the human gut microbiome.\n\nA. aquisgranensis is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, and can produce short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate and butyrate, as end products of its metabolism.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of A. aquisgranensis contribute to our understanding of the diversity and functional roles of the human gut microbiome, which is an area of active research due to its potential implications for human health and disease.",
