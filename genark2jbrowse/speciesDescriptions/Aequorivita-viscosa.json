  "description": "Aequorivita viscosa is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming microorganism. Aequorivita viscosa is characterized by its viscous and slimy appearance, which is due to the production of extracellular polysaccharides. This species was initially isolated from a seawater sample collected near Antarctica and is typically found in marine environments. Aequorivita viscosa is known for its ability to degrade various complex organic compounds, making it potentially useful in bioremediation and biotechnological applications.",
