  "description": "Aeromicrobium alkaliterrae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Nocardioidaceae. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of Aeromicrobium alkaliterrae are typically rod-shaped and can occur singly or in pairs.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from a soil sample collected from an alkaline environment. It is capable of growing at a wide range of pH levels, with an optimal growth pH ranging from 7.0 to 10.0, indicating its adaptation to alkaline conditions.\n\nAeromicrobium alkaliterrae is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose. It is also capable of hydrolyzing starch and casein, suggesting its involvement in the degradation of complex organic compounds in its natural habitat.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aeromicrobium alkaliterrae is closely related to other Aeromicrobium species, which are commonly found in soil and aquatic environments. The ability of this species to thrive in alkaline conditions may contribute to its ecological role in specialized habitats, such as saline or soda lakes.",
