  "description": "Aestuariibius violaceus is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a tidal flat sediment sample. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and violet-pigmented bacterium. The cells are motile and exhibit a gliding type of movement. \n\nAestuariibius violaceus is an aerobic organism, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is chemoorganotrophic, using organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources. The optimal growth temperature for this species is reported to be around 30Â°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, Aestuariibius violaceus belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, specifically within the class Cytophagia. Comparative analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that it is most closely related to other bacterial species found in similar estuarine or tidal flat environments.\n\nThe violet pigmentation of Aestuariibius violaceus is likely due to the production of carotenoid compounds, which are common in many bacteria and serve various functions, such as protecting the cells from oxidative stress. This pigmentation is a distinctive characteristic that helps in the identification and differentiation of this bacterial species.",
