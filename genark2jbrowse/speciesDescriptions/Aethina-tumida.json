  "description": "Aethina tumida, commonly known as the small hive beetle, is a species of nitidulid beetle native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is an opportunistic parasite and scavenger that primarily targets honeybee colonies.\n\nThe small hive beetle is a small, dark-colored insect, measuring around 5-7 millimeters in length. It has a flattened, oval-shaped body and a distinct pronotum (the dorsal plate behind the head). The beetle's larvae are cream-colored and can grow up to 11 millimeters in length.\n\nAethina tumida primarily feeds on honey, pollen, and bee brood within the honeybee hive. The beetles and their larvae can cause significant damage to the hive, leading to the destruction of comb, contamination of honey, and the eventual collapse of the colony if left unchecked.\n\nThe small hive beetle is considered an invasive species in many regions outside of its native range, including North America, Australia, and parts of Europe. It has become a significant pest for commercial and hobbyist beekeepers, and its presence can have severe economic consequences for the apiculture industry.\n\nEffective management strategies for the small hive beetle involve a combination of hive inspections, trapping, and the use of chemical or biological control methods, depending on the specific regulations and environmental conditions in the affected area.",
