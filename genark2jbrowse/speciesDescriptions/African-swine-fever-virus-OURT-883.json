  "description": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) OURT 88/3 is a strain of the African swine fever virus, which is a large, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Asfarviridae family. The OURT 88/3 strain was isolated from ticks in Mozambique and is considered a moderately virulent strain of ASFV.\n\nThe ASFV OURT 88/3 strain is known to cause an acute and often fatal disease in domestic pigs, characterized by high fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, and internal hemorrhaging. However, the OURT 88/3 strain is less virulent compared to some other ASFV strains, and infected pigs may sometimes recover from the disease.\n\nASFV OURT 88/3 can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, as well as through tick vectors, such as the Ornithodoros tick species. The virus can also be spread through contaminated feed, equipment, and vehicles.\n\nUnderstanding the specific characteristics of the OURT 88/3 strain and other ASFV variants is crucial for the development of effective prevention and control strategies against this economically significant livestock disease, which can have devastating impacts on pork production and trade.",
