  "description": "Agathobaculum butyriciproducens is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from the fecal sample of a healthy human individual. This species belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia.\n\nThe cells of A. butyriciproducens are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. They are capable of forming oval-shaped endospores. This bacterium is considered a strict anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\nBiochemically, A. butyriciproducens is characterized by its ability to ferment carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and lactose, and produce butyric acid as the major end-product. This trait is reflected in the species name \"butyriciproducens,\" which refers to its capacity to produce butyrate.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences have placed A. butyriciproducens within the family Lachnospiraceae, which is a group of gut-associated bacteria known for their involvement in the breakdown of complex polysaccharides and the production of short-chain fatty acids.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of A. butyriciproducens contribute to our understanding of the diversity and functional roles of anaerobic bacteria within the human gut microbiome, which is an active area of research in the field of microbiology and human health.",
