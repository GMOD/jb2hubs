  "description": "Agathobaculum massiliense is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from a human stool sample. It belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridiales order.\n\nThe cells of A. massiliense are rod-shaped, ranging from 2 to 6 μm in length and 0.5 to 1 μm in width. They are motile and can form oval-shaped spores. The bacterium is strictly anaerobic, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\nBiochemically, A. massiliense is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, producing acetate, lactate, and hydrogen as the main end-products. It is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that A. massiliense is closely related to other members of the Clostridiales, such as the genus Clostridium. However, it represents a distinct species within the Agathobaculum genus.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of A. massiliense contribute to the understanding of the diversity of the human gut microbiome and its potential role in human health and disease.",
