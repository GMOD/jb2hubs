  "description": "Agreia pratensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Agreia pratensis was first isolated from a grassland soil sample collected in Germany.\n\nThe cells of Agreia pratensis are typically rod-shaped and can form short chains. They are motile, with the help of peritrichous flagella. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nAgreia pratensis is considered a soil-dwelling bacterium and is known to play a role in the decomposition of organic matter in grassland ecosystems. It has the ability to degrade various plant-derived polymers, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, making it an important contributor to the carbon cycle in its natural habitat.\n\nTaxonomically, Agreia pratensis is classified within the family Microbacteriaceae, which is a family of actinobacteria commonly found in soil and other terrestrial environments. The genus Agreia was first proposed in 2001, and Agreia pratensis was described as a novel species in 2004.",
