  "description": "Agrilutibacter niabensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Niabi, South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Agrilutibacter.\n\nThe cells of Agrilutibacter niabensis are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-1.5 μm in length.\n\nAgrilutibacter niabensis is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for its growth and metabolism. It is chemoorganotrophic, which indicates that it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Agrilutibacter niabensis is closely related to other members of the genus Agrilutibacter, which are commonly found in soil and aquatic environments.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Agrilutibacter niabensis include a temperature range of 25-30°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0. It is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as starch and cellulose, suggesting its potential role in the decomposition of organic matter in soil ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Agrilutibacter niabensis is a soil-dwelling bacterium with characteristics typical of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and its discovery has contributed to our understanding of the microbial diversity and potential functional roles in terrestrial environments.",
