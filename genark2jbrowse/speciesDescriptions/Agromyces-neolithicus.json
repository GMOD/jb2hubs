  "description": "Agromyzes neolithicus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Agromyces. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of A. neolithicus are typically rod-shaped and exhibit a distinctive branching morphology, which is characteristic of the Agromyces genus.\n\nThis species was first isolated from a Neolithic archaeological site in Germany, hence the specific epithet \"neolithicus.\" It is considered an actinobacterium, a group of bacteria known for their ability to degrade complex organic compounds and their roles in various environmental and biotechnological processes.\n\nThe genome of A. neolithicus has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential adaptations to the Neolithic environment. Further research on this species may provide valuable information about the microbial communities associated with ancient archaeological sites and their potential applications in fields such as bioremediation or biotechnology.",
