  "description": "Ahaetulla prasina, commonly known as the green vine snake, is a species of arboreal snake found in parts of Southeast Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and parts of Indonesia. It is a member of the Colubridae family and is known for its distinctive slender, elongated body and bright green coloration, which helps it blend in with the foliage it inhabits.\n\nThe green vine snake is a non-venomous snake that primarily feeds on small lizards, frogs, and rodents. It has a highly specialized body shape, with a triangular head, large eyes, and a long, prehensile tail that allows it to move and hunt effectively in the tree canopy. The snake's green coloration and ability to sway back and forth mimicking the movement of a vine make it an excellent camouflage, helping it to ambush its prey undetected.\n\nAhaetulla prasina is considered a relatively docile species, though it may strike if threatened. It is an important part of the ecosystem, playing a role in controlling populations of small vertebrates and serving as prey for larger predators. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species, as habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities can pose a threat to its populations in some regions.",
