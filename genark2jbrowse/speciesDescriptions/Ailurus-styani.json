  "description": "Ailurus styani, also known as Styan's Red Panda, is a subspecies of the red panda (Ailurus fulgens) native to the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi province in China. It is a small, arboreal mammal with a distinctive reddish-brown fur, a bushy tail, and a rounded head.\n\nStyan's Red Panda is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss and fragmentation. It is found in mixed temperate forests and bamboo thickets, where it feeds primarily on bamboo leaves and shoots.\n\nCompared to the more widely known Himalayan Red Panda (Ailurus fulgens fulgens), Styan's Red Panda is generally smaller in size and has a more reddish-brown coloration. It is an elusive and solitary animal, with limited data available on its population size and ecology.\n\nConservation efforts for Styan's Red Panda include habitat protection, anti-poaching measures, and captive breeding programs to ensure the long-term survival of this unique subspecies of the red panda.",
