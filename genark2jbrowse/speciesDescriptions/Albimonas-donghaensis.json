  "description": "Albimonas donghaensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from seawater collected from the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) near Donghae, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium.\n\nMorphologically, A. donghaensis cells are rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-2.0 μm long. The cells are capable of gliding motility.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. donghaensis belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes. Genome analysis has revealed that the species has a circular chromosome with a G+C content of around 37.8 mol%.\n\nPhysiologically, A. donghaensis is chemoorganotrophic, capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C.\n\nThe species was first described in 2007 based on the isolation and characterization of the type strain, which was deposited in culture collections. Further research may reveal additional insights into the ecology, metabolism, and potential applications of this marine bacterial species.",
