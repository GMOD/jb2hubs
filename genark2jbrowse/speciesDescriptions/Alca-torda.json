  "description": "Alca torda, commonly known as the razorbill, is a seabird species belonging to the family Alcidae, which includes auks, puffins, and murres. The razorbill is a medium-sized, stocky bird with a distinctive black and white plumage and a large, laterally compressed bill that is adapted for diving and catching fish.\n\nRazorbills are found in the North Atlantic Ocean, breeding in colonies on rocky cliffs and islands. They are excellent divers, using their wings to propel themselves underwater in pursuit of small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Razorbills are monogamous and form long-term pair bonds, and both parents take part in incubating a single egg and feeding the chick.\n\nRazorbills are considered a vulnerable species due to threats such as overfishing, oil spills, and climate change, which can impact their food sources and breeding habitats. Conservation efforts, including monitoring and protection of breeding colonies, are essential for the continued survival of this unique seabird species.",
