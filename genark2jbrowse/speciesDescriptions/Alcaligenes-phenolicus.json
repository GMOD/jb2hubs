  "description": "Alcaligenes phenolicus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Alcaligenes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium. The species is known for its ability to degrade and utilize phenol, a toxic organic compound, as a sole carbon and energy source.\n\nAlcaligenes phenolicus cells are typically rod-shaped and can form coccoid or filamentous forms under certain environmental conditions. The bacterium is capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, typically between 20°C to 37°C, and can tolerate moderate levels of phenol concentrations.\n\nThe species is of interest in bioremediation and environmental biotechnology applications due to its capacity to degrade and remove phenol from contaminated environments, such as industrial wastewater or soil. Alcaligenes phenolicus has been studied for its potential use in the development of efficient biodegradation processes for the treatment of phenol-containing waste.",
