  "description": "Alenquer virus is a species of virus that belongs to the family Hantaviridae. It is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is primarily carried by rodents as its natural reservoir hosts. The virus was first isolated in 1983 from the rodent species Oligoryzomys microtis, also known as the small-eared pygmy rice rat, in the municipality of Alenquer, Brazil.\n\nAlenquer virus is classified within the genus Orthohantavirus, which includes a number of hantaviruses known to cause serious diseases in humans, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). However, the pathogenicity and potential to cause human disease associated with Alenquer virus is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its public health significance.\n\nThe genome of Alenquer virus consists of three segments (S, M, and L) that encode the viral nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that Alenquer virus is most closely related to other hantaviruses found in South America, indicating its evolution and distribution within the region.",
