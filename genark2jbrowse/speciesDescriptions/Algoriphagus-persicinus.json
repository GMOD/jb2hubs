  "description": "Algoriphagus persicinus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Algoriphagus, which is part of the Bacteroidetes phylum. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Algoriphagus persicinus are rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and motile with the help of a single polar flagellum. They typically range in size from 0.3 to 0.5 μm in width and 1.0 to 2.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of Qingdao, China. It is known to be capable of hydrolyzing various macromolecules, such as starch, gelatin, and Tween 80, and can utilize a range of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources.\n\nAlgoriphagus persicinus has an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C and can tolerate a wide range of salinities, making it well-adapted to marine environments. The species is classified as a member of the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.",
