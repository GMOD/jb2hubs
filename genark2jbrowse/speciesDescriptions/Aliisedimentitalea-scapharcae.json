  "description": "Aliisedimentitalea scapharcae is a species of bacteria that was isolated from sediment samples collected from the Scapharca clam (Anadara subcrenata) habitat in South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nThe cells of Aliisedimentitalea scapharcae are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in the presence of 0-5% NaCl.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that Aliisedimentitalea scapharcae is most closely related to other members of the genus Aliisedimentitalea, which are commonly found in marine and estuarine environments. The species is believed to play a role in the degradation of organic matter in the sediment where it was isolated.",
