  "description": "Aliivibrio kagoshimensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Aliivibrio, which is a member of the family Vibrionaceae. This species was first isolated from seawater samples collected near Kagoshima, Japan, hence the specific epithet \"kagoshimensis.\"\n\nAliivibrio kagoshimensis is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium. It is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C, and it can tolerate a range of salinity levels, making it well-adapted to marine environments.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aliivibrio kagoshimensis is closely related to other Aliivibrio species, such as Aliivibrio fischeri, which is known for its bioluminescent properties. However, the specific ecological roles and potential applications of Aliivibrio kagoshimensis are still under investigation.",
