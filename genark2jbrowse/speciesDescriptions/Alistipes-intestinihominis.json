  "description": "Alistipes intestinihominis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was first isolated from human fecal samples. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Alistipes.\n\nThe key characteristics of Alistipes intestinihominis are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length, occurring singly or in pairs.\n\n2. Growth requirements: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth. It can grow on various media such as blood agar and brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K1.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: Alistipes intestinihominis is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive. It can ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, producing acetic and propionic acids as the main end products.\n\n4. Habitat and isolation: This bacterium has been isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract, particularly the intestines, and is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota.\n\n5. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Alistipes intestinihominis is closely related to other Alistipes species within the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n\nAlistipes intestinihominis is of interest in the field of gut microbiome research, as it may play a role in maintaining a healthy intestinal ecosystem and potentially contribute to various aspects of human health and disease.",
