  "description": "Alkalibacter saccharofermentans DSM 14828 is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a soda lake in China. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the family Clostridiaceae within the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nThis species is characterized as an obligate alkaliphile, meaning it can only grow at alkaline pH levels, with an optimal growth pH range between 8.5 and 9.5. It is a chemoorganotroph, deriving its energy from the fermentation of various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, and xylose.\n\nAlkalibacter saccharofermentans is capable of producing acetate, ethanol, and hydrogen as the main end-products of its fermentative metabolism. It exhibits a respiratory type of metabolism, using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor when available, but can also grow under anaerobic conditions.\n\nThe genome of Alkalibacter saccharofermentans DSM 14828 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the alkaline environment. This bacterium is of interest for its potential applications in biofuel production and bioremediation processes in alkaline environments.",
