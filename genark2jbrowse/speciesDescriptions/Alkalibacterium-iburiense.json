  "description": "Alkalibacterium iburiense is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a soda spring located in Iburi, Hokkaido, Japan. It is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Alkalibacterium iburiense is able to grow optimally at alkaline pH values, typically between pH 8.0 and 10.0, and at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C, with the optimal growth temperature being around 30°C. The cells of this species are motile and possess peritrichous flagella. Alkalibacterium iburiense is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Alkalibacterium iburiense belongs to the family Bacillaceae within the phylum Firmicutes. This species is considered an alkaliphilic bacterium, capable of thriving in alkaline environments.",
