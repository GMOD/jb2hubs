  "description": "Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that causes a severe, potentially fatal viral hemorrhagic fever.\n\nAHFV was first identified in 1995 in the Alkhumra region of Saudi Arabia, hence the name. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, although transmission can also occur through direct contact with infected animals or their body fluids.\n\nClinically, AHFV infection presents with a sudden onset of fever, headache, severe muscle pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, the disease can progress to hemorrhagic manifestations, such as bleeding from the nose, gums, or other mucosal surfaces, as well as liver and kidney dysfunction. The case-fatality rate for AHFV infection can range from 10% to 30%.\n\nDiagnosis of AHFV is typically done through serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or PCR-based methods. Treatment is primarily supportive, as there are no specific antiviral therapies approved for AHFV infection. Prevention focuses on reducing exposure to ticks and avoiding contact with infected animals or their body fluids.",
