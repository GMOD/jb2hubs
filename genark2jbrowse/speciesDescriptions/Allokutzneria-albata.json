  "description": "Allokutzneria albata is a species of bacterium that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Allokutzneria albata is known to be a soil-dwelling organism, typically found in terrestrial environments.\n\nThe cells of Allokutzneria albata are typically short, rod-shaped, and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium forms white to pale-yellow colonies on agar media and is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, Allokutzneria albata is closely related to other members of the genus Allokutzneria, which are also known to be soil-dwelling actinobacteria. The genus Allokutzneria was first proposed in 2008 to accommodate bacteria that were previously classified within the genus Kutzneria.\n\nLimited information is available on the specific ecological roles and metabolic capabilities of Allokutzneria albata. However, as a member of the Actinobacteria, it is likely involved in the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients in soil environments.",
