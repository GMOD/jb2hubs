  "description": "Alloyangia pacifica is a species of marine sponge found in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the phylum Porifera, which includes all sponge species. Sponges are sessile, filter-feeding organisms that lack true tissues and organs, but possess a unique body plan characterized by a system of water-transporting canals and chambers.\n\nAlloyangia pacifica is typically found growing on rocky substrates in shallow to moderate depths. It is known to exhibit a range of colors, including shades of yellow, orange, and reddish-brown. The sponge's body is typically encrusting or massively lobate in shape, with a smooth or slightly conulose surface texture.\n\nTaxonomically, Alloyangia pacifica is classified under the class Demospongiae, which comprises the majority of sponge species. The species is further categorized within the order Halichondrida and the family Hymeniacidonidae. Its specific epithet, \"pacifica,\" refers to its distribution in the Pacific Ocean region.\n\nAs a member of the phylum Porifera, Alloyangia pacifica plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as a food source and providing habitat for a variety of other organisms. The sponge's unique water-filtering abilities also contribute to the overall health and productivity of the marine environment in which it is found.",
