  "description": "Alnus glutinosa, commonly known as the common alder or black alder, is a deciduous tree species that belongs to the genus Alnus within the birch family, Betulaceae. It is native to Europe and Western Asia, and is found in moist habitats such as riverbanks, wetlands, and damp woodlands.\n\nThe common alder is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 15-25 meters. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured and dark brown with age. The leaves are simple, alternate, and broadly ovate or round in shape, with a serrated margin and a dark green upper surface. The tree is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.\n\nThe flowers of Alnus glutinosa are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The male flowers are catkins, while the female flowers develop into woody, cone-like structures that resemble small pine cones. These cones persist on the tree throughout the year and release small, winged seeds when mature.\n\nThe wood of the common alder is valued for its durability and resistance to rot, making it useful for various applications, such as furniture, construction, and the production of charcoal. Additionally, the tree is important in riparian ecosystems, where it helps stabilize riverbanks and provide habitat for a variety of wildlife species.",
