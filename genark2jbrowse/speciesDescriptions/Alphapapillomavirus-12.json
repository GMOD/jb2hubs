  "description": "Alphapapillomavirus 12 is a species of virus belonging to the Alphapapillomavirus genus, which is part of the Papillomaviridae family. Papillomaviruses are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that primarily infect the epithelial cells of their host.\n\nThe Alphapapillomavirus 12 species is known to infect and cause infections in humans. The virus has a circular, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 8 kilobase pairs in size. It encodes several genes, including those responsible for viral replication, capsid formation, and modulation of the host cell environment to promote viral persistence and propagation.\n\nAlphapapillomavirus 12 is associated with the development of various types of warts, including common warts, plantar warts, and flat warts, which are benign skin growths caused by the virus's ability to induce hyperproliferation of the infected epithelial cells. While the majority of Alphapapillomavirus 12 infections are asymptomatic or result in the development of benign lesions, in some cases, the virus has been linked to the development of certain types of cancer, particularly cervical cancer, when persistent infection occurs.",
