  "description": "Alteribacillus iranensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Iran. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium. The cells of A. iranensis are rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to form endospores. \n\nPhylogenetically, A. iranensis belongs to the genus Alteribacillus, which is classified within the phylum Firmicutes and the class Bacilli. The species was named after its place of isolation, Iran.\n\nBiochemically, A. iranensis is able to hydrolyze starch and casein, and it can grow in the presence of up to 7% NaCl. The optimal growth temperature for this bacterium is around 37Â°C.\n\nWhile the specific ecological roles and metabolic capabilities of A. iranensis are not yet fully understood, its isolation from soil samples suggests it may play a role in soil processes and nutrient cycling. Further research is needed to elucidate the physiological characteristics and potential applications of this newly described bacterial species.",
