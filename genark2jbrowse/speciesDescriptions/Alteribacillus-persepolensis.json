  "description": "Alteribacillus persepolensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected near the ancient city of Persepolis in Iran. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Alteribacillus within the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nThe cells of A. persepolensis are typically 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.5 μm in length. They are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen for growth, and are capable of forming endospores, which are dormant, resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that A. persepolensis is closely related to other members of the genus Alteribacillus, which are known to be found in various soil and environmental samples.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for A. persepolensis include a temperature range of 25-40°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0. It is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates and other organic compounds as carbon and energy sources for its metabolism.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles and potential applications of this bacterial species, which was only recently discovered and described in the scientific literature.",
