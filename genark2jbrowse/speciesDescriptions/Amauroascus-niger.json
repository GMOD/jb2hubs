  "description": "Amauroascus niger is a species of ascomycete fungus that belongs to the order Eurotiales. It is a saprobic organism, meaning it derives its nutrients from decaying organic matter. \n\nThe fungus typically produces dark-colored, spherical fruiting bodies called cleistothecia, which can measure up to 200 μm in diameter. These cleistothecia contain numerous asci, each containing eight ascospores. The ascospores are smooth, spherical, and dark-colored, typically measuring 8-12 μm in diameter.\n\nAmauroascus niger is commonly found in soil and decaying plant material, particularly in temperate and tropical regions. It plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The fungus has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of enzymes or the degradation of certain pollutants.",
