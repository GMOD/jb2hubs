  "description": "Amblyopsis spelaea, commonly known as the northern cavefish or northern cave salamander, is a species of cavefish that inhabits the cave systems of the United States. This species is an obligate cave-dwelling organism, meaning it is adapted to live exclusively in the dark, nutrient-poor environments of caves.\n\nAmblyopsis spelaea is a small, elongated fish, typically measuring between 8 to 12 centimeters in length. It has a slender, cylindrical body and a flattened head, which is characteristic of many cave-dwelling organisms. The northern cavefish lacks eyes, as a result of its adaptation to the complete darkness of its subterranean habitat, and instead has a well-developed sensory system, including lateral line organs and chemoreceptors, to detect movement and chemical cues in the water.\n\nThis species is a predator, feeding on small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and insects, found within the cave ecosystem. Amblyopsis spelaea exhibits traits common to cave-dwelling organisms, including reduced pigmentation, slowed metabolism, and a prolonged life span.\n\nThe northern cavefish is found in the cave systems of the central and eastern United States, including areas of Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. Due to its specialized habitat requirements and susceptibility to environmental disturbances, the species is considered vulnerable and is protected in several states.",
