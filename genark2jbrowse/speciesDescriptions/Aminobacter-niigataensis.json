  "description": "Aminobacter niigataensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in Niigata, Japan. It belongs to the genus Aminobacter, which is a group of gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria.\n\nThe key characteristics of Aminobacter niigataensis are as follows:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Growth conditions: Aminobacter niigataensis is a mesophilic bacterium, capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. It can grow in a pH range of 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH around 7.0-7.5.\n\n3. Metabolism: The bacterium is chemoheterotrophic, meaning it can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic acids.\n\n4. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Aminobacter niigataensis is closely related to other members of the genus Aminobacter, which are classified within the family Phyllobacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales, and class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\n5. Ecological roles: Aminobacter niigataensis is believed to play a role in the cycling of nitrogen and other nutrients in soil ecosystems, as it is capable of utilizing various nitrogen-containing compounds as energy sources.\n\nOverall, Aminobacter niigataensis is a soil-dwelling bacterium with the ability to adapt to a range of environmental conditions and contribute to nutrient cycling in the soil.",
