  "description": "Ammospiza maritima maritima, commonly known as the Seaside Sparrow, is a subspecies of the Seaside Sparrow (Ammospiza maritima) found along the Atlantic coast of the United States. This small songbird is adapted to live in coastal salt marshes, where it forages for insects, seeds, and other small invertebrates.\n\nThe Seaside Sparrow maritima subspecies is characterized by its gray-brown plumage, with a distinct yellow lore (the area between the eye and the bill) and a dark-streaked breast and sides. It has a relatively short, pointed bill suited for its diet, and its long legs allow it to move through the dense, grassy marsh habitat.\n\nAmmospiza maritima maritima is an important component of the coastal wetland ecosystem, playing a role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of these fragile environments. Its habitat preferences and nesting requirements make it a useful indicator species for monitoring the health and integrity of salt marsh habitats.",
