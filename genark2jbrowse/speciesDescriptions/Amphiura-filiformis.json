  "description": "Amphiura filiformis is a species of brittle star, a type of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. It is commonly known as the thread-like brittle star or the slender brittle star.\n\nAmphiura filiformis is a small, delicate species, typically measuring between 5-10 cm in total length, including its long, thin arms. The central disc, where the arms originate, is relatively small compared to the length of the arms. The arms are segmented and can easily break and regenerate, a characteristic common among brittle stars.\n\nThis species is found in marine environments, typically living in soft sediments, such as muddy or sandy seafloors, at depths ranging from the shallow subtidal zone to several hundred meters. Amphiura filiformis is a suspension feeder, capturing organic particles and plankton from the water column using its arms.\n\nReproduction in Amphiura filiformis involves the release of gametes into the water column, where external fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a planktonic stage before settling and metamorphosing into the adult form.\n\nAmphiura filiformis plays an important role in the benthic ecosystem, contributing to the bioturbation and oxygenation of the seafloor sediments through its burrowing and feeding activities. It is also a prey item for various marine predators, such as fish and crustaceans, making it an integral part of the food web in its habitat.",
