  "description": "Amycolatopsis bartoniae is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Barton, Australia. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of A. bartoniae are irregular rod-shaped and can form mycelium-like structures. They are typically between 0.4-0.8 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. bartoniae belongs to the genus Amycolatopsis, which is part of the family Pseudonocardiaceae within the order Pseudonocardiales. Genome analysis has revealed that A. bartoniae has a high G+C content, typically around 69-71 mol%.\n\nThis species is capable of hydrolyzing starch, gelatin, and Tween 80, but not cellulose. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth. A. bartoniae is also known to produce melanin-like pigments.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for A. bartoniae include a temperature range of 28-37°C and a neutral pH around 7.0. It is considered a mesophilic bacterium.\n\nOverall, Amycolatopsis bartoniae is a soil-dwelling actinobacterium with the potential for biotechnological applications due to its unique metabolic capabilities and secondary metabolite production.",
