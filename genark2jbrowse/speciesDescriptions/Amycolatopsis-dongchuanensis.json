  "description": "Amycolatopsis dongchuanensis is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Dongchuan, Yunnan Province, China. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of A. dongchuanensis are irregular rods or cocci, and they can form extensively branched substrate and aerial mycelia. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 28-30Â°C, and it can grow in the pH range of 6.0-9.0, with an optimum pH of 7.0-8.0.\n\nChemotaxonomic analysis of A. dongchuanensis revealed that the major menaquinone is MK-9(H4), and the cell wall contains meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The major cellular fatty acids are iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C17:0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that A. dongchuanensis is closely related to other Amycolatopsis species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.\n\nThis species has been reported to produce several bioactive secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which may have potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Further research is ongoing to explore the diversity and biotechnological potential of this actinobacterial species.",
