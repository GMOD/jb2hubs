  "description": "Anableps anableps, commonly known as the four-eyed fish, is a species of fish belonging to the genus Anableps. It is found in coastal marine and brackish waters of northern South America, including the Caribbean.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Anableps anableps is its unique eye structure. Each of its eyes is divided into two distinct parts by a horizontal band of tissue, giving the appearance of four eyes. This adaptation allows the fish to simultaneously see above and below the water's surface, a unique adaptation that helps it spot predators and prey.\n\nAnableps anableps is a small, elongated fish that can grow up to 30 cm in length. It has a rounded, flattened head and a protruding lower jaw. The fish's coloration is typically brownish or olive-green on the upper body, with a lighter, paler underside.\n\nThese fish are generally omnivorous, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including crustaceans, insects, and algae. They are known to swim near the water's surface, where they can take advantage of their unique eye structure to hunt and avoid predators.\n\nAnableps anableps is an important part of the coastal ecosystem in its native range and is of interest to both scientists and aquarium hobbyists due to its remarkable adaptations and unique appearance.",
