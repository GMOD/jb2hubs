  "description": "Anaerobiospirillum thomasii is a species of spiral-shaped, anaerobic bacteria that was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a human patient. Some key features of this species include:\n\n1. Morphology: Anaerobiospirillum thomasii is a Gram-negative, motile bacterium with a spiral or helical shape. The cells typically measure around 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width.\n\n2. Anaerobic Metabolism: As the name suggests, Anaerobiospirillum thomasii is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It utilizes fermentative metabolism to obtain energy.\n\n3. Habitat and Isolation: This species was originally isolated from a human clinical specimen, specifically the gastrointestinal tract. It is believed to be a part of the normal gut microbiome in some individuals.\n\n4. Taxonomic Classification: Anaerobiospirillum thomasii belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Deltaproteobacteria, order Desulfovibrionales, and family Desulfovibrionaceae.\n\n5. Significance: While the precise role of Anaerobiospirillum thomasii in human health and disease is not yet fully understood, its presence in the gut microbiome suggests it may play a part in various gastrointestinal processes or have potential implications for human health.\n\nOverall, Anaerobiospirillum thomasii is a relatively recently discovered, anaerobic, spiral-shaped bacterium that is found in the human gastrointestinal tract and represents an area of ongoing research in the field of gut microbiology.",
