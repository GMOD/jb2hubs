  "description": "Anaerobranca gottschalkii DSM 13577 is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic bacteria that was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, United States. It belongs to the genus Anaerobranca, which is classified within the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nSome key characteristics of this species are:\n\n1. Anaerobic growth: A. gottschalkii is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Thermophilic nature: It is a thermophilic bacterium, thriving at high temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature around 60°C (140°F).\n\n3. Spore-forming: A. gottschalkii can form endospores, which are resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\n4. Saccharolytic metabolism: The bacterium is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, such as glucose, xylose, and arabinose, as its primary energy source.\n\n5. Taxonomic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, A. gottschalkii is closely related to other members of the genus Anaerobranca, which are found in various high-temperature, anaerobic environments.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, particularly in the production of biofuels and the degradation of complex carbohydrates under high-temperature, anaerobic conditions.",
