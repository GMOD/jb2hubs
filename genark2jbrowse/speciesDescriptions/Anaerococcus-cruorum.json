  "description": "Anaerococcus cruorum is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium. It belongs to the genus Anaerococcus, which is a member of the family Tissierellaceae within the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nAnaerococcus cruorum is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It is found as part of the normal human microbiome, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract and on the skin.\n\nThis species is typically non-spore-forming and non-motile. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it can occasionally cause infections in immunocompromised individuals or in cases of disruption to the normal microbial balance.\n\nAnaerococcus cruorum is biochemically active, capable of fermenting various carbohydrates and producing end products such as acetic acid and lactic acid. This metabolic activity contributes to its role in the human microbiome and potential involvement in certain disease states.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the specific ecological functions and clinical relevance of Anaerococcus cruorum within the complex human microbial communities.",
