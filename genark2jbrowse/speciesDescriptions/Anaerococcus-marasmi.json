  "description": "Anaerococcus marasmi is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid bacterium that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum. It was first isolated from the human gut microbiome of individuals with Crohn's disease. \n\nThe cells of A. marasmi are typically round or oval-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They thrive in an anaerobic environment and are considered obligate anaerobes, meaning they cannot grow in the presence of oxygen.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. marasmi is closely related to other Anaerococcus species, which are commonly found in the human gut and skin microbiome. These bacteria are known to play a role in the breakdown of complex organic matter and the production of short-chain fatty acids, contributing to the overall metabolic activities within the host's microbiome.\n\nWhile the specific functions and interactions of A. marasmi within the human gut ecosystem are still being investigated, its presence and abundance have been associated with certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential clinical relevance and implications of this anaerobic bacterium in human health and disease.",
