  "description": "Anaerococcus rubeinfantis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium. It was first isolated from the stool sample of a healthy infant. \n\nThe key features of Anaerococcus rubeinfantis are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are spherical to ovoid in shape, approximately 0.5-1.0 Î¼m in diameter, and occur singly or in pairs.\n\n2. Oxygen requirement: Anaerococcus rubeinfantis is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n3. Habitat and isolation: This species was originally isolated from the fecal matter of a healthy infant, indicating its natural habitat is the human gut microbiome.\n\n4. Biochemical characteristics: Anaerococcus rubeinfantis is non-spore-forming, non-motile, and catalase-negative. It can ferment carbohydrates to produce lactic acid as the main end-product.\n\n5. Phylogeny: Genetically, Anaerococcus rubeinfantis belongs to the genus Anaerococcus, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Peptoniphilaceae.\n\nOverall, Anaerococcus rubeinfantis represents an anaerobic, commensal bacterium that is part of the normal gut microbiota in healthy human infants. Its role in the gut ecosystem and potential implications for human health are still under investigation.",
