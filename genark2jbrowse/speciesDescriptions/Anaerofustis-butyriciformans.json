  "description": "Anaerofustis butyriciformans is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. It was isolated from a soil sample and belongs to the genus Anaerofustis, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nThe cells of Anaerofustis butyriciformans are rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 2-4 μm long. They are capable of forming endospores, which are resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nThis species is classified as an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It is mesophilic, with an optimal growth temperature between 30-37°C.\n\nAnaerofustis butyriciformans is characterized by its ability to ferment carbohydrates, producing butyric acid as the primary end-product. This metabolic characteristic is reflected in its species name, \"butyriciformans,\" which refers to the production of butyrate.\n\nThe genome of Anaerofustis butyriciformans has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. Further research may uncover the ecological role and potential applications of this anaerobic bacterial species.",
