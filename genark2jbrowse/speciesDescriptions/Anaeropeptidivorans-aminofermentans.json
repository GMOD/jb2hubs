  "description": "Anaeropeptidivorans aminofermentans is a species of anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria that was isolated from an anaerobic wastewater treatment plant. It is a rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium that is capable of fermenting amino acids as its primary source of energy and carbon.\n\nThe key features of this species are:\n\n1. Anaerobic: It can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Peptidolytic: It can break down and utilize peptides and proteins as its energy and carbon sources.\n\n3. Aminolytic: It can ferment amino acids to obtain energy.\n\n4. Non-spore-forming: It does not produce resistant spore structures.\n\n5. Phylogenetically, it belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is closely related to other anaerobic, amino acid-fermenting bacteria.\n\nThis species plays a role in the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, particularly proteins and peptides, in environments like anaerobic wastewater treatment facilities. Its metabolic capabilities make it an important member of the microbial community involved in the recycling of nitrogen-containing compounds in anoxic ecosystems.",
