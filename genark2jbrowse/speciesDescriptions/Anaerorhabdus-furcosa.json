  "description": "Anaerorhabdus furcosa is a species of anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming microorganism that is found in various anaerobic environments, such as sewage, soil, and the gastrointestinal tract of animals.\n\nThe cells of A. furcosa are typically straight or slightly curved rods, measuring approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-6 μm in length. They can form terminal or subterminal spores, which allow the bacteria to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nA. furcosa is a strict anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, which means it derives its energy and carbon from the oxidation of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nThe species is known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic matter in anaerobic environments, contributing to the cycling of nutrients and the maintenance of microbial communities in these ecosystems.",
