  "description": "Anaerosphaera aminiphila DSM 21120 is a species of anaerobic bacterium that was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in Japan. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium.\n\nSome key features of Anaerosphaera aminiphila DSM 21120:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is chemoorganotrophic, using organic compounds as its energy source.\n\n2. Substrate utilization: It can utilize a variety of amino acids, including alanine, serine, threonine, and glutamate, as its sole carbon and energy sources.\n\n3. Phylogeny: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Anaerosphaera aminiphila DSM 21120 is classified within the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Clostridiales incertae sedis.\n\n4. Genome: The complete genome of Anaerosphaera aminiphila DSM 21120 has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome of approximately 2.7 million base pairs.\n\n5. Ecology: This bacterium was originally isolated from a wastewater treatment plant, suggesting it may play a role in the degradation of organic compounds in anaerobic environments.\n\nOverall, Anaerosphaera aminiphila DSM 21120 is a unique anaerobic bacterium that has adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, oxygen-depleted environments, such as wastewater treatment systems.",
