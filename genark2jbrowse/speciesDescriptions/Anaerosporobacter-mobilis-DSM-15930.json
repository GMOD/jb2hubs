  "description": "Anaerosporobacter mobilis DSM 15930 is a species of anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that was isolated from a tannery wastewater treatment plant. Some key characteristics of this species are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.5-3.0 μm long. They form terminal endospores.\n\n2. Physiology: A. mobilis is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is mesophilic, with an optimal growth temperature range of 30-37°C.\n\n3. Metabolism: The bacterium is chemoorganotrophic, using organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources. It can ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, producing acetate, lactate, and hydrogen as the main fermentation end-products.\n\n4. Taxonomy: A. mobilis belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Clostridiales incertae sedis. It is the type strain of the genus Anaerosporobacter.\n\n5. Habitat and Ecology: A. mobilis was originally isolated from a tannery wastewater treatment plant, indicating its ability to thrive in environments with high organic loads and potentially toxic compounds. Its anaerobic lifestyle and fermentative metabolism suggest a role in the degradation of complex organic matter in anoxic environments.\n\nThis brief scientific description provides an overview of the key taxonomic, morphological, physiological, and ecological characteristics of the Anaerosporobacter mobilis DSM 15930 species.",
