  "description": "Anaerotardibacter muris is a species of anaerobic, slow-growing bacterium that was isolated from the cecum of a laboratory mouse. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the class Bacteroidia.\n\nSome key features of Anaerotardibacter muris:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile.\n\n2. Growth conditions: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. The optimal growth temperature is around 37Â°C.\n\n3. Metabolism: Anaerotardibacter muris is a chemoorganotroph, obtaining energy by breaking down organic compounds. It is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\n4. Ecology: This bacterium is part of the gut microbiome of mice and likely plays a role in the digestion and metabolism of complex carbohydrates in the host's intestinal tract.\n\n5. Taxonomy and phylogeny: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Anaerotardibacter muris is closely related to other members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, particularly within the Bacteroidia class.\n\nThis brief description provides an overview of the key characteristics and taxonomic placement of the Anaerotardibacter muris species, highlighting its anaerobic lifestyle, carbohydrate metabolism, and association with the mouse gut microbiome.",
