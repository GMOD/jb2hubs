  "description": "Ancylobacter rudongensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Ancylobacter. It is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. The cells of A. rudongensis are approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length, and they can form aggregates or chains.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil samples collected from Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, China. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that A. rudongensis is closely related to other species within the genus Ancylobacter, which are known to be associated with various environmental habitats, including soil, water, and plant materials.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of A. rudongensis are currently under investigation, as further research is needed to fully understand its functional and biotechnological potential.",
