The plant has a characteristic green stem with purple or reddish nodes and lanceolate-shaped leaves that are dark green in color. The flowers are small, white or pink, and arranged in terminal or axillary panicles.\n\nThe plant is known for its high content of medicinal compounds, particularly the diterpenoid lactones, such as andrographolide, which are believed to be responsible for its therapeutic properties.
