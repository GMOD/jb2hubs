  "description": "Angelakisella massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from human stool samples collected in Marseille, France. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Angelakisella massiliensis are coccoid to slightly rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter. They are oxidase-negative and catalase-positive, and can grow at temperatures ranging from 28°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 37°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has placed Angelakisella massiliensis within the Firmicutes phylum, specifically in the Clostridiales order and the Ruminococcaceae family. It is closely related to other members of the Ruminococcaceae, which are commonly found in the human gut microbiome.\n\nThe genome of Angelakisella massiliensis has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome of approximately 2.8 Mb in size. Analysis of the genome suggests that this bacterium is capable of carbohydrate metabolism and may play a role in the breakdown of complex polysaccharides in the human gut.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecology, physiology, and potential clinical significance of Angelakisella massiliensis within the human microbiome.",
