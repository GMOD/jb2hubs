  "description": "Anguilla rostrata, commonly known as the American eel or the common eel, is a species of eel found in the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Greenland to Brazil. It is a catadromous fish, meaning it spends its adult life in freshwater and migrates to the ocean to spawn.\n\nThe American eel is a long, snake-like fish with a cylindrical, elongated body and a pointed snout. It has a dorsal fin, an anal fin, and a tail fin that are continuous, forming a single, ribbon-like fin around the body. The skin is slimy and scaleless, and the color can range from greenish-brown to yellowish-brown, with a lighter underside.\n\nAmerican eels are known for their unique life cycle, which involves a remarkable trans-Atlantic migration. They are born in the Sargasso Sea, a region in the western Atlantic Ocean, and as larvae (called leptocephali), they drift with the ocean currents towards the coasts of North and South America. Once they reach the coastal waters, they metamorphose into the familiar eel-like shape and enter estuaries and freshwater habitats, where they spend their adult lives.\n\nAs adults, American eels can grow up to 1.2 meters (4 feet) in length and can live for up to 20 years. They are opportunistic predators, feeding on a variety of prey, including small fish, crustaceans, and aquatic insects. When it's time to spawn, the adult eels migrate back to the Sargasso Sea, where they reproduce and then die.\n\nThe American eel is an important component of many aquatic ecosystems and has cultural and economic significance in various regions. However, like many other eel species, the American eel population has been declining due to factors such as habitat loss, overfishing, and environmental pollution, making it a species of conservation concern.",
