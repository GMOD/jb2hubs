  "description": "Angustibacter luteus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of Angustibacter luteus are typically slender, rod-shaped, and exhibit a yellow pigmentation. This pigmentation is likely due to the production of carotenoid compounds by the bacteria.\n\nAngustibacter luteus was first isolated from soil samples and is known to be a facultative chemoheterotrophic organism, meaning it can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. The optimal growth temperature for this species is typically around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a range of pH conditions, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nWhile the specific ecological roles and potential applications of Angustibacter luteus are still under investigation, members of the Actinobacteria phylum, to which this species belongs, are known to play important roles in soil and plant-associated microbial communities, and some species have been found to have potential for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.",
