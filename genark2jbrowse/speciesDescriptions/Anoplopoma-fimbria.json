  "description": "Anoplopoma fimbria, commonly known as the sablefish or black cod, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Anoplopomatidae. It is a deep-sea dwelling fish found in the northern Pacific Ocean, ranging from the Bering Sea to Baja California.\n\nThe sablefish has a distinctive elongated and laterally compressed body, with a large head and a small mouth. Its coloration is typically dark gray to black on the upper parts, gradually transitioning to a lighter underside. The sablefish possesses a single, long dorsal fin that extends nearly the entire length of its body.\n\nSablefish are known to be a slow-growing and long-lived species, with some individuals reaching up to 94 years of age. They primarily feed on a variety of small fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods, and are an important commercial and recreational fishery species in the regions where they are found.\n\nDue to their deep-sea habitat and life history characteristics, sablefish are considered vulnerable to overfishing and require careful management for sustainable exploitation. Conservation efforts and responsible fishing practices are essential to maintain healthy sablefish populations in the future.",
