  "description": "Anoura caudifer, commonly known as the tailed tailless bat or the long-tongued bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in South America, primarily in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n\nThe Anoura caudifer is a small to medium-sized bat, with a wingspan ranging from 30 to 35 cm. Its most distinctive feature is the absence of a visible tail, which is the reason for its common name \"tailless bat.\" Instead, it has a small, fleshy projection at the end of its hindquarters, which is the remnant of the tail.\n\nThis species is known for its long, slender tongue, which can extend up to twice the length of its head. This adaptation allows it to feed on nectar and pollen from various flowering plants, making it an important pollinator in its ecosystem.\n\nAnoura caudifer is primarily a nocturnal species, emerging from its roosts, which are often caves, hollow trees, or abandoned buildings, to forage for food. It is adept at hovering and can maneuver with great agility in dense vegetation to locate its preferred food sources.\n\nThe conservation status of Anoura caudifer is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats to its population.",
