  "description": "Anoxynatronum buryatiense is a species of anaerobic, halophilic bacteria that was isolated from a hypersaline soda lake in the Buryat Republic, Russia. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Anoxynatronum buryatiense are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. They are able to grow in a wide range of salt concentrations, from 0.6 M to 4.5 M NaCl, with an optimal growth occurring at around 2.5 M NaCl.\n\nAnoxynatronum buryatiense is obligately anaerobic, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is chemoheterotrophic, utilizing various organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteinaceous substrates, and organic acids, as carbon and energy sources.\n\nPhylogenetically, Anoxynatronum buryatiense belongs to the class Clostridia within the phylum Firmicutes. It is closely related to other halophilic, anaerobic bacteria found in hypersaline environments.\n\nThe species was first described in 2011 based on the isolation and characterization of the type strain from a soda lake in the Buryat Republic, Russia. Its name, \"buryatiense,\" refers to the geographic origin of the strain.",
