  "description": "Apis dorsata, commonly known as the giant honey bee or the rock bee, is a species of honey bee native to Southeast Asia. It is the largest species of honey bee, with a body length ranging from 16 to 19 millimeters (0.63 to 0.75 inches) and a wingspan of 40 to 45 millimeters (1.57 to 1.77 inches).\n\nApis dorsata is a highly social insect, living in large, exposed nests that can measure up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in diameter. These nests are typically built on the branches of tall trees or on the overhanging ledges of cliffs and rocky outcrops. The bees use their strong mandibles to construct the comb, which can contain up to 50,000 individual bees.\n\nThe species is known for its aggressive defensive behavior, using its large size and powerful sting to protect its nest from predators. Apis dorsata plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a pollinator, contributing to the reproduction of many plant species in its native range.\n\nDespite its large size and intimidating appearance, Apis dorsata is an important species for honey production in Southeast Asia, with the honey and wax being harvested by local communities for consumption and commercial use.",
