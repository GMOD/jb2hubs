  "description": "Apodemus sylvaticus, commonly known as the wood mouse or long-tailed field mouse, is a small rodent species that belongs to the family Muridae. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, inhabiting various woodland, scrubland, and grassland habitats.\n\nThe wood mouse is a nocturnal and arboreal species, characterized by its slender body, large eyes, and long, hairy tail. It typically measures between 8 to 12 centimeters in length, with a tail that is slightly longer than the body. The fur is soft and can range in color from light brown to reddish-brown, with a lighter underside.\n\nThese mice are opportunistic foragers, feeding on a variety of seeds, nuts, berries, insects, and small invertebrates. They play an important role in the ecosystem as prey for various predators, such as owls, foxes, and snakes.\n\nApodemus sylvaticus is known for its high reproductive capacity, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year, each containing up to 12 offspring. This adaptability and prolific breeding strategy contribute to the species' widespread distribution and success in occupying diverse habitats.\n\nThe wood mouse is considered a common and widespread species throughout its range, and it is not currently listed as a threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
