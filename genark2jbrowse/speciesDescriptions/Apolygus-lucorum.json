  "description": "Apolygus lucorum is a species of true bug (order Hemiptera) that belongs to the family Miridae, commonly known as plant bugs or capsid bugs. It is a small, elongated insect, typically measuring around 5-6 millimeters in length.\n\nApolygus lucorum is primarily found in Europe, where it inhabits various types of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and agricultural areas. The species feeds on the sap of plants, particularly those belonging to the Rosaceae family, such as roses, blackberries, and raspberries.\n\nThe coloration of Apolygus lucorum is typically green or yellowish-green, which helps it blend in with the vegetation it occupies. The species undergoes incomplete metamorphosis, with nymphs resembling the adults but lacking fully developed wings. Apolygus lucorum plays a role in the ecosystem as a plant herbivore, potentially affecting the growth and productivity of the plants it feeds on.",
