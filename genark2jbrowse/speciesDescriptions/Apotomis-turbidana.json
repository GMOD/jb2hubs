  "description": "Apotomis turbidana is a species of moth belonging to the family Tortricidae, commonly known as the tortrix moths. It is a small-sized moth, with a wingspan typically ranging from 12 to 16 millimeters.\n\nThe wings of Apotomis turbidana are greyish-brown in color, with indistinct darker markings. The forewings often have a slightly mottled or turbid appearance, which is the origin of the species' name \"turbidana.\" The hindwings are greyish-white in color.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe, with its range extending from the United Kingdom and Ireland to central and eastern Europe. It is often found in deciduous forests, woodlands, and urban areas where its host plants, such as oak (Quercus spp.) and birch (Betula spp.), are present.\n\nThe larvae of Apotomis turbidana feed on the leaves and buds of their host plants, and can occasionally cause minor damage to these trees. The moth has a single generation per year, with adults typically flying from May to July.\n\nOverall, Apotomis turbidana is a common and widely distributed species of tortrix moth, playing a small but ecologically relevant role in forest and urban ecosystems as a herbivore and part of the local lepidopteran community.",
