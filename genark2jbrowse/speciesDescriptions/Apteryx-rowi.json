  "description": "Apteryx rowi, commonly known as the Rowi or Okarito kiwi, is a species of flightless bird endemic to the Okarito region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is one of the rarest and smallest kiwi species, with a distinctive reddish-brown plumage and a long, slender bill.\n\nThe Rowi kiwi is a nocturnal and solitary bird that inhabits dense, temperate rainforests. It is a member of the Apterygidae family, which includes all kiwi species. Kiwis are unique among birds in that they have no visible wings, and their feathers resemble hair rather than the typical avian plumage.\n\nThe Rowi kiwi is known for its keen sense of smell, which it uses to locate its primary food sources, such as insects, worms, and small vertebrates. It is also noteworthy for its exceptionally long lifespan, with individuals living up to 50 years in the wild.\n\nDue to its limited geographical range and historical habitat loss, the Rowi kiwi is classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts, including predator control and captive breeding programs, have been instrumental in efforts to protect and restore this unique and threatened species.",
