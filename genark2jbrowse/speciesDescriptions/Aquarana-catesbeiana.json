  "description": "Aquarana catesbeiana, commonly known as the American bullfrog, is a species of large, carnivorous frog native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Ranidae, the true frogs.\n\nThe American bullfrog is a robust amphibian, characterized by its large size and distinctive deep, resonant \"jug-o'-rum\" call. It can grow up to 20 cm (8 inches) in body length and weigh up to 500 grams (1.1 pounds), making it one of the largest frog species in North America.\n\nBullfrogs are opportunistic predators, feeding on a wide variety of prey, including small mammals, birds, reptiles, and even other amphibians. They use their large, powerful jaws to capture and consume their prey.\n\nAquarana catesbeiana is an aquatic species, spending most of its time in permanent bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They are excellent swimmers and can remain submerged for extended periods, relying on cutaneous respiration (absorption of oxygen through the skin) to supplement their lung-based respiration.\n\nBullfrogs are known for their complex life cycle, undergoing a complete metamorphosis from aquatic tadpoles to terrestrial adults. The tadpoles can take up to two years to develop into adult frogs, reflecting the species' adaptation to the temperate climate of their native range.\n\nDue to their large size, prolific breeding, and adaptability, American bullfrogs have been introduced to various regions around the world, where they can become invasive species, posing a threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity.",
