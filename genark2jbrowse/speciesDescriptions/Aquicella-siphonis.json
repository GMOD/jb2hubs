  "description": "Aquicella siphonis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a drinking water distribution system. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Aquicella siphonis are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nAquicella siphonis is considered an oligotrophic bacterium, meaning it is able to grow and thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is found in various aquatic habitats, including drinking water distribution systems, where it may play a role in biofilm formation and the potential degradation of water quality.\n\nPhysiologically, Aquicella siphonis is characterized by its ability to utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, such as glucose, fructose, and acetate. It is capable of aerobic respiration, using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor.\n\nThe genome of Aquicella siphonis has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. Further research is ongoing to understand the ecological significance and potential applications of this bacterial species in water treatment and management.",
