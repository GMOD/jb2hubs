  "description": "Aquilegia eximia, commonly known as the serpentine columbine or San Francisco columbine, is a perennial flowering plant species native to California, United States. It belongs to the genus Aquilegia, which is part of the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae.\n\nAquilegia eximia is a herbaceous plant that typically grows between 30 to 60 cm (12 to 24 inches) in height. The plant produces lush, green foliage and distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from bright red to deep purple, with yellow centers. The flowers have five petals that are spurred at the base, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Aquilegia.\n\nThe plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partially shaded to sunny habitats, such as woodland edges, mountain slopes, and stream banks. It is often found growing in serpentine-derived soils, hence the common name \"serpentine columbine.\"\n\nAquilegia eximia is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions due to its limited distribution and potential threats from habitat loss and degradation. It is an important component of the native plant communities in which it occurs and plays a role in supporting local pollinators, such as hummingbirds and bees.",
