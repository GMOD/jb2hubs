  "description": "Aquilutibacter rugosus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in South Korea.\n\nSome key characteristics of Aquilutibacter rugosus are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Colony appearance: On agar plates, the colonies of Aquilutibacter rugosus are yellowish, circular, convex, and have a rough surface.\n\n3. Physiology: The bacterium is chemoorganotrophic, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as starch and xylan.\n\n4. Taxonomy: Aquilutibacter rugosus is classified within the genus Aquilutibacter, which is a member of the family Cytophagaceae. The genus Aquilutibacter was created to accommodate bacteria that are phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct from other members of the Cytophagaceae family.\n\n5. Habitat and ecology: Aquilutibacter rugosus has been isolated from soil, indicating its natural habitat is likely in terrestrial environments. As a soil bacterium, it may play a role in the degradation of organic matter and nutrient cycling in the ecosystem.\n\nThis brief scientific description provides an overview of the key characteristics and taxonomic placement of Aquilutibacter rugosus, a bacterial species discovered in soil samples from South Korea.",
