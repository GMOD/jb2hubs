  "description": "Aquimarina amphilecti is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from the marine sponge Amphilectus fucorum, which is found in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAquimarina amphilecti is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and heterotrophic bacterium. It is rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to glide across surfaces. The cells typically range in size from 0.4 to 0.8 μm in width and 1.2 to 4.0 μm in length.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Aquimarina amphilecti include a temperature range of 20-30°C and a pH range of 6.5-8.5. It requires sodium ions (Na+) for growth and can tolerate moderate levels of salinity.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimarina amphilecti is closely related to other members of the genus Aquimarina, which are commonly found in marine environments and have been associated with various invertebrate hosts, such as sponges and corals.\n\nThe ecological role of Aquimarina amphilecti within the sponge microbiome is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be involved in the breakdown and utilization of complex organic compounds, potentially contributing to the overall nutrient cycling within the sponge ecosystem.",
