  "description": "Aquimarina gracilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aquimarina gracilis is characterized by its slender, rod-shaped cells that typically measure around 0.4-0.6 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from seawater collected from the East Sea (also known as the Sea of Japan) off the coast of South Korea. Aquimarina gracilis is considered a marine bacterium, as it requires sodium ions (Na+) for growth and thrives in saline environments.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimarina gracilis is closely related to other members of the genus Aquimarina, which are known to be versatile in their metabolic capabilities and play roles in the cycling of organic matter in marine ecosystems.\n\nFurther research on the physiological and ecological characteristics of Aquimarina gracilis may provide insights into its function and significance within the microbial communities of marine environments.",
