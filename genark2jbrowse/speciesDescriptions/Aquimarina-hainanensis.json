  "description": "Aquimarina hainanensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from sediment samples collected from Hainan Island, China. It belongs to the genus Aquimarina, which is a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nAquimarina hainanensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is rod-shaped and motile, with gliding motility. The cells are approximately 0.3-0.5 μm wide and 1.2-2.5 μm long.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimarina hainanensis is most closely related to other Aquimarina species, sharing high sequence similarity with Aquimarina sediminis and Aquimarina longa.\n\nAquimarina hainanensis is capable of hydrolyzing various macromolecules, such as starch, casein, and Tween 80, indicating its ability to utilize a range of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. The bacterium is also able to grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28°C.\n\nThis species was first described in 2011 and is considered a member of the marine bacterial community, playing a potential role in the cycling of organic matter in the marine environment.",
