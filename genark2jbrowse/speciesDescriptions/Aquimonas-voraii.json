  "description": "Aquimonas voraii is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, and motile bacterium. Aquimonas voraii was first isolated from a seawater sample collected from the Bay of Bengal, India.\n\nThe cells of Aquimonas voraii are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-2.5 μm in length. They possess a single polar flagellum, which enables their motility. The optimum growth temperature for Aquimonas voraii is around 30°C, and it can grow in a wide range of pH conditions, from 6.0 to 9.0.\n\nBiochemically, Aquimonas voraii is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources. It also exhibits catalase and oxidase activities. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimonas voraii is closely related to other members of the genus Aquimonas, which are commonly found in marine and estuarine environments.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of Aquimonas voraii in natural or engineered systems are still under investigation, as further research is needed to elucidate its specific metabolic capabilities and interactions within microbial communities.",
