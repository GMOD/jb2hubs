  "description": "Arachis ipaensis is a wild species of peanut (Arachis) native to South America. It is a perennial, herbaceous plant that grows as a prostrate vine, rooting at the nodes. The leaves are pinnately compound, with 2-4 pairs of leaflets. The flowers are small, yellow, and produced singly or in pairs along the stems. After flowering, the flower stalks elongate and bend into the soil, where the fruits (peanuts) develop and mature underground.\n\nArachis ipaensis is of particular interest to plant breeders and geneticists because it is one of the wild progenitor species of the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea). It is valued for its potential to contribute beneficial traits, such as disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance, to peanut crop improvement programs. Ongoing research aims to further characterize the genetic diversity and agronomic potential of this wild peanut species.",
