It is a medium-sized parakeet, measuring approximately 30-35 cm in length and weighing around 100-120 grams.\n\nThe sun parakeet is known for its striking plumage, which is predominantly yellow with a bright orange-red head, neck, and upper breast. The wings and back are greenish-yellow, and the tail is long and pointed. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males typically displaying more vibrant colors than females.\n\nSun parakeets are social birds and often observed in small flocks. They are primarily found in tropical forests, savannas, and agricultural areas within their native range. These parakeets are known for their lively and playful behavior, and they are often kept as pets due to their engaging personalities and striking appearance.\n\nThe sun parakeet is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, trapping for the pet trade, and other threats.
