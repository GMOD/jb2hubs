  "description": "Arcanobacterium ihumii is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Ihumi, Japan. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nCells of A. ihumii are coccoid to short rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has placed A. ihumii within the genus Arcanobacterium, a member of the phylum Actinobacteria. The genus Arcanobacterium comprises several species of aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nA. ihumii is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\nThis species was initially described in 2011 based on a single isolate obtained from a soil sample. Further research is needed to elucidate the ecological role and potential applications of A. ihumii in various environments.",
