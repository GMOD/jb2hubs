  "description": "Archocentrus centrarchus, commonly known as the convict cichlid, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the cichlid family. It is native to Central America, particularly in the rivers and lakes of Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.\n\nThe convict cichlid is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 10-12 centimeters (4-5 inches). It has a laterally compressed body with a distinctive pattern of black and white vertical bars, which gives it a 'convict-like' appearance, hence the common name.\n\nArchocentrus centrarchus is known for its parental care behavior, where both the male and female participate in protecting and caring for their offspring. The fish are also known to be relatively aggressive, especially during breeding and territorial defense.\n\nConvict cichlids are popular aquarium fish due to their interesting behavior, vibrant coloration, and relatively hardy nature. They are often kept in community aquariums, although their aggressive tendencies may require careful tank management and the inclusion of suitable tank mates.",
