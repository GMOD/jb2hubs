  "description": "Arctostaphylos glauca, commonly known as the big berry manzanita, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is found primarily in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in California and Baja California.\n\nThe plant is characterized by its distinctive bluish-green, waxy leaves and reddish-brown, peeling bark. The leaves are thick, leathery, and oblong-shaped, typically measuring 2-4 inches in length. The small, urn-shaped flowers are white or pinkish and bloom in clusters during the spring. These flowers are followed by spherical, edible berries that turn from green to a deep reddish-purple when ripe.\n\nArctostaphylos glauca is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It is an important species in its native ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects. The plant's deep, extensive root system also helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in its chaparral habitat.",
