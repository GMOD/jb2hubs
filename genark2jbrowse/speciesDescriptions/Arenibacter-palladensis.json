  "description": "Arenibacter palladensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from sediment samples collected from a tidal flat located in Pallada, Russia. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Arenibacter palladensis are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They exhibit a beige to pale yellow pigmentation.\n\nPhylogenetically, Arenibacter palladensis belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, class Cytophagia, order Cytophagales, and family Cytophagaceae. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that it is most closely related to other Arenibacter species.\n\nArenibacter palladensis is chemoorganotrophic, capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. It has an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C and can grow in the presence of up to 5% (w/v) NaCl.\n\nThis bacterium was first described in 2006 based on its isolation and characterization from the tidal flat sediment sample. It represents a distinct species within the genus Arenibacter, which includes several other marine-associated bacteria.",
