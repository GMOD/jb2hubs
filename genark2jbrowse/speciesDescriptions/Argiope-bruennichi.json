  "description": "Argiope bruennichi, commonly known as the wasp spider or the European garden spider, is a species of orb-weaver spider found in various parts of Europe and Asia. This species is notable for its distinctive black and yellow banded abdomen, which resembles the coloration of a wasp, hence the common name \"wasp spider.\"\n\nArgiope bruennichi is a medium-sized spider, typically ranging from 8 to 22 millimeters in body length. The females are generally larger than the males. The spider's web is an intricate, spiral-shaped orb web, often with a distinctive zig-zag pattern of silk, known as a stabilimentum, running through the center.\n\nThis species is known for its unique hunting behavior, where it waits at the center of its web and wraps its prey, such as grasshoppers or other insects, in layers of silk. Argiope bruennichi is not considered a threat to humans and its venom is not particularly potent. However, it can deliver a painful bite if handled or threatened.\n\nThe wasp spider is an important part of the ecosystem, contributing to the control of insect populations in its habitat. It is commonly found in gardens, meadows, and other areas with abundant vegetation, where it can construct its impressive webs.",
