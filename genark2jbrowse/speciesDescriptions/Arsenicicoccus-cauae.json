  "description": "Arsenicicoccus cauae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium. Arsenicicoccus cauae was isolated from a soil sample collected in Peru and is known to be resistant to arsenic, a toxic heavy metal. This species is able to grow in the presence of high concentrations of arsenate and arsenite, the two main inorganic forms of arsenic. The genome of Arsenicicoccus cauae has been sequenced, providing insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying its arsenic resistance. This bacterium is of interest for its potential applications in bioremediation of arsenic-contaminated environments.",
