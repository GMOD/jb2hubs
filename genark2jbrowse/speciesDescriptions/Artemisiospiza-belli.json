It is a member of the Emberizidae family, which includes various species of finches, buntings, and sparrows.\n\nThe Bell's sparrow is a small, gray-brown bird with distinctive features. It has a streaked back, a white-throated face with a dark eye-line, and a dark-colored beak. The bird's underparts are typically grayish-white, and it has a long, pointed tail. The species is known for its melodic, trilling song, which is often heard during the breeding season.\n\nArtemisiospiza belli primarily inhabits sagebrush and chaparral habitats, where it forages on the ground for seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. The species is known to be a year-round resident in its range, with some populations exhibiting partial migration patterns.\n\nThe Bell's sparrow is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although its population is believed to have experienced a moderate decline in recent decades due to habitat loss and fragmentation.",
