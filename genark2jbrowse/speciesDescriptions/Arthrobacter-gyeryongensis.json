  "description": "Arthrobacter gyeryongensis is a species of gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria. It was first isolated from soil samples collected from Mount Gyeryong in South Korea. The cells of A. gyeryongensis are coccoid or short-rod shaped, and they exhibit a characteristic morphological change from rod-shaped to coccoid forms during the growth cycle.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. gyeryongensis belongs to the genus Arthrobacter, which is a group of ubiquitous soil bacteria known for their ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds. The genus Arthrobacter is characterized by their ability to undergo a cell shape transition from rod-shaped to coccoid forms, a feature that is also observed in A. gyeryongensis.\n\nBiochemically, A. gyeryongensis is capable of hydrolyzing starch and gelatin, and it can utilize various carbohydrates as carbon sources. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can tolerate moderate levels of salt.\n\nThe genome of A. gyeryongensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential roles in environmental processes. Further studies on this species may contribute to our understanding of the diversity and ecological functions of Arthrobacter bacteria in soil ecosystems.",
