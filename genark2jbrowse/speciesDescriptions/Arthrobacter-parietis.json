  "description": "Arthrobacter parietis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Arthrobacter. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Arthrobacter parietis is known to be isolated from the walls of buildings, specifically from the indoor environment.\n\nThe cells of Arthrobacter parietis are typically coccoid or rod-shaped, and they can undergo morphological changes during their life cycle, transitioning from a rod-shaped form to a coccoid form. This ability to change shape is a characteristic feature of the genus Arthrobacter.\n\nArthrobacter parietis is considered a common inhabitant of indoor environments and has been found in various building materials and surfaces. It is known to play a role in the biodegradation of organic compounds and may contribute to the microbial community dynamics in the built environment.\n\nThe genome of Arthrobacter parietis has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of its ecological roles and potential applications in areas such as bioremediation or indoor air quality management.",
