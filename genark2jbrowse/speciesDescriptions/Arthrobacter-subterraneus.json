  "description": "Arthrobacter subterraneus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Arthrobacter. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Arthrobacter subterraneus was first isolated from subsurface soil samples collected in Japan.\n\nThe cells of Arthrobacter subterraneus are coccoid or rod-shaped, and they exhibit a characteristic cell morphology that changes from a coccoid to a rod-shaped form during their growth cycle. This species is able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 35°C, and it can tolerate moderate levels of salt.\n\nArthrobacter subterraneus is considered a soil bacterium, as it was originally isolated from subsurface soil environments. It is known to possess metabolic capabilities that allow it to degrade various organic compounds, including aromatic compounds and hydrocarbons. This ability to break down complex organic molecules makes Arthrobacter subterraneus an interesting subject for studies in bioremediation and environmental microbiology.\n\nOverall, Arthrobacter subterraneus is a versatile and adaptable soil bacterium that has potential applications in various fields, such as environmental biotechnology and soil ecology.",
