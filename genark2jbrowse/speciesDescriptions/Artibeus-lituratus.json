  "description": "Artibeus lituratus, commonly known as the greater fruit-eating bat or Jamaican fruit bat, is a species of bat that belongs to the family Phyllostomidae. It is a medium-sized bat, typically measuring between 10 to 14 centimeters in body length and weighing around 50 to 80 grams.\n\nArtibeus lituratus is found in various regions of Central and South America, including Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and parts of northern South America. It is a highly adaptable species that can thrive in a wide range of habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, urban areas, and agricultural landscapes.\n\nThis bat is known for its frugivorous diet, primarily feeding on a variety of fruits, such as figs, mangoes, and bananas. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a seed disperser, contributing to the regeneration of plant communities. Artibeus lituratus has well-developed olfactory and visual senses, which aid in locating and identifying ripe fruits.\n\nThe species is generally considered to be of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as it has a wide distribution and is relatively common throughout its range. However, habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and urbanization can pose a threat to local populations of Artibeus lituratus.",
