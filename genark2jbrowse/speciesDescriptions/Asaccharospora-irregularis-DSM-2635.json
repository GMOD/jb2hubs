  "description": "Asaccharospora irregularis DSM 2635 is a species of microorganism that belongs to the domain Archaea. It is a halophilic (salt-loving) archaeon, meaning it thrives in high-salt environments.\n\nThis species was first isolated from a saline lake in Siberia, Russia, and has been assigned the strain designation DSM 2635 in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) culture collection.\n\nAsaccharospora irregularis is a non-spore-forming, rod-shaped archaeon that exhibits irregular cell morphology. It is capable of anaerobic respiration, utilizing various organic compounds as energy sources. The optimal growth conditions for this species include high salinity, typically around 15-25% NaCl, and a slightly alkaline pH range.\n\nGenomic studies have revealed that Asaccharospora irregularis has a circular chromosome and possesses genes involved in the utilization of various carbohydrates and the production of energy through oxidative phosphorylation. This archaeon is considered a halophilic extremophile, adapted to thrive in the harsh, high-salt environments in which it is typically found.",
