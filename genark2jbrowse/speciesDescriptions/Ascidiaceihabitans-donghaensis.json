  "description": "Ascidiaceihabitans donghaensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the tunic of an ascidian (sea squirt) collected from the coast of Donghae, South Korea. Ascidiaceihabitans is a genus within the phylum Bacteroidetes, and the species donghaensis was first reported and characterized in 2017.\n\nSome key features of Ascidiaceihabitans donghaensis include:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile rods.\n\n2. Growth conditions: The bacterium is aerobic and mesophilic, growing optimally at 30Â°C and pH 7.0-8.0.\n\n3. Biochemical characteristics: It is capable of hydrolyzing starch, casein, and Tween 80, and can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as sole carbon sources.\n\n4. Phylogenetic placement: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that Ascidiaceihabitans donghaensis is closely related to other members of the genus Ascidiaceihabitans, which are typically associated with marine invertebrates.\n\n5. Ecological role: As an inhabitant of the tunic of an ascidian, Ascidiaceihabitans donghaensis likely plays a role in the ecology and nutrient cycling within the host organism's microbiome.\n\nThis brief scientific description provides an overview of the key taxonomic, morphological, and physiological characteristics of the bacterial species Ascidiaceihabitans donghaensis, highlighting its unique association with a marine invertebrate host.",
