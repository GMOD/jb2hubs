  "description": "Ascoidea rubescens DSM 1968 is a species of yeast that belongs to the Saccharomycotina subphylum of the Ascomycota fungal phylum. It is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nThe cells of A. rubescens are oval to spherical in shape and measure approximately 3-6 micrometers in diameter. They possess a cell wall and a single nucleus. The species is known to produce a reddish-pink pigment, which gives the colonies a distinctive color when grown on agar media.\n\nA. rubescens is a chemoorganotrophic organism, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It is capable of fermenting various sugars, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, to produce ethanol and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n\nThe strain DSM 1968 was originally isolated from an unknown source and is maintained in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) culture collection, which is a major repository for microbial strains used in research and industrial applications.",
