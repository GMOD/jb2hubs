  "description": "Aspergillus neoniger CBS 115656 is a species of filamentous fungi belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Brazil.\n\nAspergillus neoniger is a member of the Aspergillus section Nigri, which is a group of closely related black-spored Aspergillus species. The colonies of A. neoniger grow rapidly on standard fungal media, forming a dense, velvety texture with a black or dark green color.\n\nMicroscopically, A. neoniger produces characteristic conidiophores (asexual reproductive structures) with a globose vesicle and biseriate phialides (specialized cells that produce conidia). The conidia are smooth-walled and dark brown to black in color.\n\nGenetically, A. neoniger is closely related to other Aspergillus section Nigri species, but can be distinguished by its unique DNA sequence characteristics and other phenotypic features. The CBS 115656 strain is the ex-type culture, meaning it serves as the reference strain for the species.\n\nAs a member of the Aspergillus genus, A. neoniger has the potential to produce various secondary metabolites and enzymes of biotechnological and medical importance. However, its specific ecological roles and potential applications are still under investigation.",
