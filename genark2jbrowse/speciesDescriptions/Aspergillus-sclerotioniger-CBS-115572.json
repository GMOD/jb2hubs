  "description": "Aspergillus sclerotioniger CBS 115572 is a species of filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It is a member of the section Fumigati, which includes several important human and animal pathogens.\n\nAspergillus sclerotioniger is characterized by the production of dark brown to black sclerotia, which are dense, compact, and resistant structures that allow the fungus to survive unfavorable environmental conditions. The conidiophores (spore-bearing structures) of this species are relatively short and lack distinct vesicles, and the conidia (spores) are globose to subglobose in shape.\n\nThe strain CBS 115572 was isolated from soil collected in Indonesia and is the ex-type strain of the species, meaning it represents the reference specimen used to define the species.\n\nAspergillus sclerotioniger is primarily known from its environmental distribution, and its potential pathogenicity or ecological role is not well-established. Further research may elucidate the specific characteristics and significance of this fungal species.",
