  "description": "Aspergillus uvarum CBS 121591 is a species of filamentous fungus that belongs to the genus Aspergillus. It was first isolated from grape must in Spain and formally described in 2009.\n\nAspergillus uvarum is a homothallic (self-fertile) species, meaning it can produce sexual spores (ascospores) without the need for a mating partner. The fungus produces green-colored conidiophores (asexual spore-bearing structures) and globose to subglobose, rough-walled conidia (asexual spores).\n\nPhylogenetic analyses have placed A. uvarum within the Aspergillus section Aspergillus, which also includes other important species like A. niger and A. carbonarius. The species is known to be associated with the fermentation of grape must and has been isolated from various wine-related environments.\n\nFurther studies on the physiology, secondary metabolite production, and ecological roles of A. uvarum CBS 121591 may provide insights into its potential applications or impact in food and beverage industries.",
