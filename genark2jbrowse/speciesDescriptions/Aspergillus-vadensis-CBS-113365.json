  "description": "Aspergillus vadensis CBS 113365 is a species of filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in the Netherlands and was given the designation CBS 113365.\n\nAspergillus vadensis is a member of the Aspergillus section Fumigati, a group of fungi known for their ability to grow at high temperatures and their potential to cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe fungus exhibits typical Aspergillus morphology, including the production of conidiophores and conidia (asexual spores). Colonies of A. vadensis on agar media are typically white to yellow-green in color, with a velvety or powdery texture.\n\nGenetic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that A. vadensis is closely related to other Aspergillus species within the Fumigati section, but it can be distinguished by its unique DNA sequence and other phenotypic characteristics.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of A. vadensis are still being investigated, as the species was only recently described and its full capabilities are not yet fully understood.",
