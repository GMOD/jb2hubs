  "description": "Aspidoscelis tigris stejnegeri, also known as the Stejneger's whiptail, is a subspecies of the tiger whiptail lizard. It is a medium-sized lizard that belongs to the family Teiidae, which are found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\nThe Stejneger's whiptail is characterized by its long, slender tail and robust body. Its coloration typically consists of a dark brown or black base with distinct light-colored stripes or spots running along its back and sides. The species is known for its agility and ability to quickly dart across the ground, which it uses to evade predators.\n\nAspidoscelis tigris stejnegeri is found in arid and semi-arid habitats, such as deserts, scrublands, and rocky areas. It is an insectivorous species, feeding primarily on a variety of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and small lizards.\n\nThe Stejneger's whiptail is an important component of the local ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. It is a relatively common species, and its conservation status is considered to be of least concern.",
