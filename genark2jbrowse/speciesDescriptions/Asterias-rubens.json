  "description": "Asterias rubens, commonly known as the common starfish or red starfish, is a species of starfish found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, and North Sea. It is a member of the class Asteroidea, order Forcipulatida, and family Asteriidae.\n\nAsterias rubens is a benthic marine invertebrate that typically ranges in color from reddish-orange to purple. It has a central disc and five relatively long, flexible arms that can regenerate if lost. The upper surface of the body is covered with small spines, known as papulae, which help with respiration and excretion.\n\nThis species is a generalist predator, feeding on a variety of organisms such as mussels, clams, and oysters. It uses its tube feet and stomach everting capabilities to pry open the shells of its prey and consume the soft tissues inside. Asterias rubens plays an important role in the ecosystem, helping to maintain the balance of benthic communities.\n\nReproduction in Asterias rubens involves the release of sperm and eggs into the water column, where external fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a planktonic stage before settling and metamorphosing into juvenile starfish. This species is considered relatively common throughout its range and is not currently threatened with extinction.",
