  "description": "Astrovirus VA4 is a species of virus that belongs to the Astroviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is known to infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe Astrovirus VA4 genome is approximately 6.8 to 7.3 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b encode the non-structural proteins involved in viral replication, while ORF2 encodes the capsid protein that forms the viral shell.\n\nAstrovirus VA4 is primarily associated with gastroenteritis and diarrheal illness in humans, particularly in young children and immunocompromised individuals. The virus is believed to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with contaminated food or water being the primary sources of infection.\n\nMolecular epidemiological studies have shown that Astrovirus VA4 is geographically widespread, with strains detected in various regions around the world. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the prevalence, transmission dynamics, and clinical significance of this viral species in human populations.",
