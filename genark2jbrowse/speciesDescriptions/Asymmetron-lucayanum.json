  "description": "Asymmetron lucayanum is a species of lancelet, a type of small, eel-like marine chordate that belongs to the phylum Chordata and the subphylum Cephalochordata. Lancelets are known for their lack of a true vertebral column and their distinct body plan, which includes a notochord, dorsal nerve cord, and pharyngeal gill slits.\n\nAsymmetron lucayanum is found in the tropical western Atlantic Ocean, primarily in the Bahamas and the Caribbean Sea. It is a small, translucent organism that typically measures around 3-5 cm in length. The species is characterized by its asymmetrical body shape, with a more developed right side and a smaller, less developed left side. This asymmetry is a defining feature of the genus Asymmetron.\n\nAsymmetron lucayanum is a filter-feeder, using its pharyngeal gill slits to filter small particles and microorganisms from the surrounding water. It has a simple nervous system and lacks a true brain, but it does possess a light-sensitive structure called an ocellus, which may serve a role in light detection and orientation.\n\nAs a member of the Cephalochordata, Asymmetron lucayanum is considered an important model organism for understanding the evolution and development of chordates, as it shares many features with the common ancestor of vertebrates and other chordate lineages.",
