  "description": "Athene cunicularia, commonly known as the burrowing owl, is a small species of owl found in the Americas. It is a member of the family Strigidae and the genus Athene.\n\nThe burrowing owl is a unique owl species that lives in underground burrows, often in abandoned rodent dens or human-made structures. It is characterized by its small stature, round head, and long legs. The burrowing owl has a distinctive brown and white plumage, with a distinctive white \"eyebrow\" above each eye.\n\nThese owls are primarily crepuscular, meaning they are most active during the dawn and dusk hours. They feed on a variety of small prey, including insects, small mammals, and reptiles. Burrowing owls are known for their adaptations to life underground, such as their ability to dig and maintain their own burrows.\n\nBurrowing owls are found in a range of habitats, including grasslands, prairies, and deserts, across North and South America. They are considered a species of conservation concern in some regions due to habitat loss and human activities.",
