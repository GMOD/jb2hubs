  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species of virus called \"Atlantic salmon calicivirus.\" Caliciviruses are a family of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, other mammals, and some marine animals. However, there does not appear to be a specific virus by the name \"Atlantic salmon calicivirus\" reported in the scientific literature.\n\nSalmon are known to be susceptible to various viral diseases, such as infectious salmon anemia virus, salmonid alphavirus, and salmon pancreas disease virus, but a distinct calicivirus affecting Atlantic salmon has not been described. If such a virus were to be discovered and characterized, a scientific description would likely include details about its genome structure, phylogenetic relationships to other caliciviruses, its host range, and any unique biological properties. However, without a documented specimen or scientific reports on this specific virus, I cannot provide a more detailed scientific description.",
