  "description": "Aulostomus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted flutemouth or trumpetfish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Aulostomidae. It is found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.\n\nThe spotted flutemouth is a slender, elongated fish with a distinctive long, tubular snout, which it uses to capture small prey such as small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. Its body is typically brown or gray in color, with distinctive dark spots or blotches along its sides, which helps it camouflage among coral reefs and other marine habitats.\n\nThese fish can reach a maximum length of around 60 cm (24 inches) and are known for their ability to change their body posture and orientation to blend in with their surroundings, making them effective ambush predators. They are found in a variety of marine habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and rocky areas, and play a role in the overall ecosystem dynamics of these environments.",
