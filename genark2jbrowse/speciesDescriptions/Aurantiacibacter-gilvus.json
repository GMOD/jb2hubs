  "description": "Aurantiacibacter gilvus is a bacterial species that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cells of A. gilvus are rod-shaped and exhibit a yellowish-orange pigmentation, which is characteristic of the genus Aurantiacibacter.\n\nThe species was first isolated from soil collected in China. It is capable of growing at a range of temperatures, typically between 10°C and 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. A. gilvus can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences have shown that A. gilvus is closely related to other members of the genus Aurantiacibacter, which are known to be found in various environmental samples, such as soil, sediments, and water.\n\nThe physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as the ecological roles of A. gilvus, are still under investigation, as more research is needed to fully understand the diversity and functions of this bacterial species in its natural habitats.",
