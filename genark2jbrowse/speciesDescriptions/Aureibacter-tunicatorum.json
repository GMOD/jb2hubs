  "description": "Aureibacter tunicatorum is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the tunic (outer covering) of a marine tunicate (sea squirt) collected from the coast of Japan. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe distinctive features of Aureibacter tunicatorum include its ability to produce a bright yellow pigment, likely carotenoids, which gives the colonies a golden-yellow appearance. The cells are motile, possessing gliding motility, and can form clusters or aggregates. This species is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as agar, carboxymethylcellulose, and starch, indicating its potential role in the degradation of complex organic matter in its natural marine environment.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences have shown that Aureibacter tunicatorum is closely related to other members of the genus Aureibacter, which are typically found in association with marine organisms or in marine sediments. The genus Aureibacter was created to accommodate these yellow-pigmented, gliding, and polysaccharide-degrading bacteria within the Cytophagaceae family.",
