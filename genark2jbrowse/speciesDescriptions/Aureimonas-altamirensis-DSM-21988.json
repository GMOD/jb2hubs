  "description": "Aureimonas altamirensis DSM 21988 is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a sample collected in the Altamira Cave, located in Cantabria, Spain. This species belongs to the genus Aureimonas, which is a member of the family Aurantimonadaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nAureimonas altamirensis DSM 21988 is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. The cells are typically rod-shaped and motile, possessing a single polar flagellum.\n\nThis species is characterized by its ability to produce a yellow-orange pigment, which is likely due to the presence of carotenoid compounds. The production of this pigment is a distinctive feature that helps in the identification and differentiation of Aureimonas altamirensis from other related bacterial species.\n\nAureimonas altamirensis DSM 21988 has been found to exhibit various metabolic capabilities, including the utilization of a range of carbohydrates and organic acids as carbon and energy sources. Additionally, this species has been reported to possess potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology due to its ability to degrade certain environmental pollutants.\n\nOverall, Aureimonas altamirensis DSM 21988 represents a unique bacterial species that has been isolated from a specific cave environment and possesses interesting physiological and metabolic characteristics, making it a subject of scientific interest and potential biotechnological applications.",
