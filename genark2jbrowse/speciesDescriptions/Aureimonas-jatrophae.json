  "description": "Aureimonas jatrophae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Aureimonas, within the family Aurantimonadaceae. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Aureimonas jatrophae are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They exhibit a yellow or orange pigmentation due to the production of carotenoid compounds.\n\nAureimonas jatrophae was initially isolated from the rhizosphere of the plant Jatropha curcas, a biofuel crop. It is known to be capable of nitrogen fixation, a process that allows the bacterium to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a more biologically available form, such as ammonia.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential role in plant growth promotion and its potential applications in agriculture, particularly in the context of sustainable biofuel production from Jatropha curcas. Further research is ongoing to explore the specific metabolic capabilities and ecological interactions of Aureimonas jatrophae.",
