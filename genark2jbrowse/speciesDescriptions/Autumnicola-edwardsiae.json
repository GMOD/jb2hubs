  "description": "Autumnicola edwardsiae is a species of freshwater snail that belongs to the family Pleuroceridae. It is native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in streams and rivers in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee.\n\nThe shell of Autumnicola edwardsiae is typically conical in shape, with a height of around 15-20 millimeters. The shell's surface is smooth and may have a reddish-brown or olive-green coloration. The aperture, or opening of the shell, is oval-shaped.\n\nThis species is a member of the genus Autumnicola, which is characterized by its operculum (a structure that can close the shell's opening) and its radula (a tongue-like structure used for feeding). Autumnicola edwardsiae is believed to feed on algae and other organic matter found in its aquatic habitat.\n\nThe reproductive biology of Autumnicola edwardsiae is not well-studied, but it is likely similar to that of other freshwater snail species, with separate sexes and the production of egg capsules that hatch into juvenile snails.\n\nThis species is considered to be of conservation concern due to habitat degradation and loss, as well as the potential impacts of invasive species and pollution in its native streams and rivers.",
