  "description": "Auxenochlorella protothecoides is a unicellular green microalgae species that belongs to the Chlorophyta division of the Plantae kingdom. It is a non-motile, spherical or ellipsoidal-shaped microalgae that reproduces asexually through the formation of autospores.\n\nThe cells of Auxenochlorella protothecoides typically range in size from 3-10 Î¼m in diameter and possess a single chloroplast that occupies a significant portion of the cell volume. The cell wall is composed of cellulose and the cytoplasm contains a prominent nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles.\n\nThis species is known for its ability to accumulate large quantities of lipids, especially under conditions of nutrient stress or imbalance. This lipid accumulation can reach up to 70% of the dry cell weight, making it a promising candidate for biofuel production and other industrial applications.\n\nAuxenochlorella protothecoides is found in a variety of aquatic environments, including freshwater, marine, and even some terrestrial habitats. It is considered a versatile and adaptable microalgae species with potential applications in the fields of bioenergy, nutraceuticals, and environmental remediation.",
