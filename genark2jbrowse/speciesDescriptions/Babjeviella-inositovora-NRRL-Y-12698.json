  "description": "Babjeviella inositovora NRRL Y-12698 is a species of yeast that belongs to the family Saccharomycetaceae. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Russia.\n\nMorphologically, Babjeviella inositovora is a unicellular, spherical to ellipsoidal yeast that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically 3-6 μm in diameter.\n\nPhysiologically, this yeast is able to utilize inositol as a sole carbon and energy source, hence the specific epithet \"inositovora\" meaning \"inositol-consuming.\" It is capable of growing in a wide range of temperatures, typically between 15-35°C.\n\nTaxonomically, Babjeviella inositovora was first described in 1981 and classified within the genus Babjeviella, which was named in honor of the Russian microbiologist Alexander Babjev. The type strain of this species is NRRL Y-12698.\n\nOverall, Babjeviella inositovora is an interesting yeast species due to its ability to metabolize inositol, a cyclic sugar alcohol that plays important roles in various cellular processes. Further study of this organism may provide insights into inositol utilization and its potential applications in biotechnology.",
