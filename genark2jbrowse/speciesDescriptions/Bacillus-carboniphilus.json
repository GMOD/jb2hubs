  "description": "Bacillus carboniphilus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacillus. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic bacterium. Bacillus carboniphilus was first isolated from soil samples collected from a coal mine in Japan.\n\nThe cells of Bacillus carboniphilus are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2.0-4.0 μm in length. They are capable of forming endospores, which are resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive under adverse environmental conditions.\n\nBacillus carboniphilus is characterized by its ability to utilize a variety of carbon sources, including coal and coal-related compounds, for growth and energy production. This makes it an interesting organism in the context of bioremediation and potential applications in the coal industry.\n\nThe optimal growth temperature for Bacillus carboniphilus is around 30-37°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0. The bacterium is considered to be a mesophilic microorganism, meaning it thrives in moderate temperature conditions.\n\nOngoing research on Bacillus carboniphilus aims to further understand its metabolic capabilities, potential applications in environmental biotechnology, and its role in the natural carbon cycle.",
