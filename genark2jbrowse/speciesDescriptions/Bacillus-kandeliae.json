  "description": "Bacillus kandeliae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacillus. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Bacillus kandeliae was first isolated from the rhizosphere of the plant Kandelia candel, a mangrove species found in coastal regions.\n\nThe cells of Bacillus kandeliae are rod-shaped and can measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-3.5 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of forming endospores, which are resistant structures that allow the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nBacillus kandeliae is known to be able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C. It can also tolerate a variety of pH conditions, ranging from pH 5.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH around 7.0.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential in various applications, such as its ability to promote plant growth and its potential use in bioremediation processes due to its tolerance to various environmental stressors.",
