  "description": "Bacillus seohaeanensis is a species of gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Seohaean, South Korea. It is a member of the Bacillus genus, which are commonly found in diverse environments, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of various organisms.\n\nThe cells of Bacillus seohaeanensis are rod-shaped and typically measure around 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2.0-3.5 μm in length. They are capable of forming endospores, which are dormant structures that allow the bacteria to survive under unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Bacillus seohaeanensis is closely related to other Bacillus species, such as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis. However, it can be distinguished from these closely related species based on its unique phenotypic and biochemical characteristics.\n\nBacillus seohaeanensis is considered a mesophilic bacterium, as it grows optimally at temperatures between 25°C and 37°C. It is also capable of tolerating a wide range of pH values, with an optimal growth pH between 6.0 and 8.0.\n\nThe potential applications and ecological roles of Bacillus seohaeanensis are still under investigation, but the species may possess interesting properties that could be useful in various biotechnological or environmental applications.",
