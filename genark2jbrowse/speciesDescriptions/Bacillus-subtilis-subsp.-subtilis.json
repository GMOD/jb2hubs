  "description": "Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium commonly found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. It is a model organism for the study of bacterial physiology, genetics, and sporulation.\n\nKey features of Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis include:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Straight, rod-shaped cells, typically 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-3 μm in length.\n\n2. Spore formation: Capable of forming endospores, which are resistant to environmental stresses such as heat, radiation, and desiccation.\n\n3. Motility: Motile, with peritrichous flagella.\n\n4. Metabolism: Aerobic, with the ability to ferment a variety of carbohydrates and produce a range of enzymes.\n\n5. Genomics: The genome of Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis is relatively well-studied, with a circular chromosome of approximately 4.2 million base pairs.\n\n6. Applications: Widely used in industrial and biotechnological applications, such as the production of enzymes, antibiotics, and other valuable compounds.\n\nBacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis is a versatile and well-characterized bacterium that has contributed significantly to our understanding of microbial biology and has numerous practical applications.",
