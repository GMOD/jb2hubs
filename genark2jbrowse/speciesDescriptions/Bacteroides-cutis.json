  "description": "Bacteroides cutis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. It is commonly found as part of the normal human gut microbiome and is also present in the skin microbiome.\n\nBacteroides cutis is a non-spore-forming, non-motile, and strictly anaerobic bacterium. It is a chemoorganotroph, obtaining energy and carbon from the fermentation of carbohydrates and other organic compounds. The bacterium is typically rod-shaped and can form small, circular, and opaque colonies on appropriate growth media.\n\nTaxonomically, Bacteroides cutis is classified within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidia class, Bacteroidales order, and Bacteroidaceae family. It is closely related to other Bacteroides species commonly found in the human gut, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.\n\nWhile Bacteroides cutis is generally considered a commensal member of the human microbiome, it has been occasionally associated with opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles and potential clinical significance of this bacterial species.",
