  "description": "Bacteroides ihuae is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It was first isolated from human fecal samples collected in Japan.\n\nThe cells of Bacteroides ihuae are rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. They are non-motile and do not possess flagella.\n\nBacteroides ihuae is a strictly anaerobic bacterium, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth. It is chemoorganotrophic, obtaining energy and carbon from the fermentation of various carbohydrates and other organic compounds.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Bacteroides ihuae is closely related to other Bacteroides species found in the human gut microbiome. It is believed to play a role in the breakdown and utilization of complex polysaccharides in the human intestinal tract.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the specific metabolic capabilities, ecological interactions, and potential roles of Bacteroides ihuae within the human gut microbial community.",
