  "description": "Bacteroides maternus is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. It was first isolated from the human gut microbiome, specifically from the fecal samples of pregnant women.\n\nSome key characteristics of Bacteroides maternus:\n\n1. Morphology: Bacteroides maternus cells are typically rod-shaped, with a length of around 0.5-1.5 μm and a width of 0.3-0.5 μm.\n\n2. Habitat and Ecology: Bacteroides maternus is a commensal member of the human gut microbiome, and it is commonly found in the lower gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals, particularly during pregnancy.\n\n3. Metabolism: As an anaerobic bacterium, Bacteroides maternus relies on fermentative metabolism to obtain energy, breaking down complex carbohydrates and other organic compounds.\n\n4. Taxonomic Affiliation: Bacteroides maternus is classified within the phylum Bacteroidetes, a major phylum of bacteria found in the human gut and other environments.\n\n5. Significance: The presence of Bacteroides maternus in the gut microbiome may have implications for human health, particularly during pregnancy, as the gut microbiome is known to undergo dynamic changes during this period. However, the specific roles and functions of Bacteroides maternus in the human gut ecosystem are still under investigation.",
