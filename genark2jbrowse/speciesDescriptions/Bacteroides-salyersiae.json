  "description": "Bacteroides salyersiae is an anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It was first isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract and is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota.\n\nSome key features of Bacteroides salyersiae:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains energy and carbon from organic compounds. It can ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\n2. Habitat and distribution: Bacteroides salyersiae is primarily found in the human gut, where it plays a role in the breakdown and utilization of complex polysaccharides.\n\n3. Genome and phylogeny: The genome of Bacteroides salyersiae has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities and evolutionary relationships within the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n\n4. Significance: As a member of the gut microbiome, Bacteroides salyersiae may contribute to host health and nutrient absorption. Its presence and abundance can be influenced by various factors, such as diet, age, and health status.\n\nOverall, Bacteroides salyersiae is a well-studied anaerobic bacterium that is an integral part of the human gut microbiome and plays a role in the maintenance of a healthy digestive system.",
