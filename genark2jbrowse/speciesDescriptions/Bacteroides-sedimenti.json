  "description": "Bacteroides sedimenti is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. It was first isolated from sediment samples collected from a freshwater lake.\n\nThe cells of Bacteroides sedimenti are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of approximately 0.3-0.5 µm in width and 0.8-1.5 µm in length. They are non-spore-forming and non-motile.\n\nBacteroides sedimenti is a strictly anaerobic organism, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth and metabolism. It is chemoorganotrophic, obtaining energy and carbon from the breakdown of organic compounds, particularly carbohydrates.\n\nPhylogenetically, Bacteroides sedimenti is closely related to other members of the Bacteroides genus, which are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals, as well as in various environmental samples, such as soil and aquatic sediments.\n\nThe specific role and ecological significance of Bacteroides sedimenti in its natural habitat, freshwater lake sediments, are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.",
