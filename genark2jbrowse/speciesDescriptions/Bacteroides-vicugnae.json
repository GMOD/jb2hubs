  "description": "Bacteroides vicugnae is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. It was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of the vicuña, a wild South American camelid.\n\nThe cells of Bacteroides vicugnae are typically rod-shaped and non-spore-forming. They are obligate anaerobes, meaning they can only grow in the absence of oxygen. The bacterium is a member of the normal gut microbiota of the vicuña and plays a role in the digestion and fermentation of plant-based materials consumed by the host.\n\nBacteroides vicugnae is considered an important component of the vicuña's gut ecosystem, contributing to the overall health and functioning of the animal's digestive system. The species has not been extensively studied, and its specific metabolic capabilities, interactions with other gut microbes, and potential roles in the host's physiology are still being investigated.",
