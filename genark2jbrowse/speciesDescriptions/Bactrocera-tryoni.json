  "description": "Bactrocera tryoni, commonly known as the Queensland fruit fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly native to eastern Australia. It is considered a major agricultural pest due to its ability to infest a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops.\n\nThe Queensland fruit fly is a small, yellow-brown fly with distinctive dark markings on its thorax and abdomen. Its wings have distinctive patterns of dark bands and spots. The female flies have a sharp, needle-like ovipositor that they use to lay their eggs inside the flesh of ripe or ripening fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe larvae (maggots) of the Queensland fruit fly feed on the flesh of the infested produce, causing significant damage and making the produce unfit for consumption or sale. This species is capable of rapid population growth, with a single female potentially laying hundreds of eggs over her lifetime.\n\nThe Queensland fruit fly is a significant threat to fruit and vegetable production in areas where it is present, and its management often requires a combination of strategies, including trapping, bait spraying, and the use of sterile insect technique. Its spread to new regions is a major concern for agricultural industries and biosecurity authorities.",
