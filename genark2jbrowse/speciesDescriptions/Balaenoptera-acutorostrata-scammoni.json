  "description": "Balaenoptera acutorostrata scammoni, also known as the Scammon's minke whale, is a subspecies of the common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata). It is found in the eastern North Pacific Ocean, primarily along the western coast of North America, from the Bering Sea to Baja California.\n\nThe Scammon's minke whale is a medium-sized baleen whale, typically reaching lengths of 7-10 meters. It has a streamlined, fusiform body shape, a small, pointed rostrum, and a tall, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin. The coloration is typically dark gray or black on the upperparts, with a white band on the flipper, and white underparts.\n\nThese whales primarily feed on small schooling fish, krill, and other small crustaceans. They are known to be agile and fast-swimming, capable of reaching speeds of up to 30 knots (55 km/h) in short bursts.\n\nThe Scammon's minke whale is considered a distinct subspecies due to differences in morphology, genetics, and geographic distribution compared to other minke whale populations. It is not currently listed as endangered, but its population status and conservation needs continue to be monitored by marine mammal research and management organizations.",
