  "description": "The Banna virus (BANV) strain JKT-6423 is a member of the genus Seadornavirus, family Reoviridae. It is a double-stranded RNA virus that was first isolated from mosquitoes in Indonesia in 1964.\n\nThe BANV JKT-6423 strain is an arthropod-borne virus, meaning it is transmitted by arthropod vectors, primarily mosquitoes. The virus is known to infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, where it can cause a febrile illness characterized by symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.\n\nGenetically, the BANV JKT-6423 strain has a segmented genome consisting of 12 double-stranded RNA segments. The genomic sequence and phylogenetic analysis of this strain have revealed its close relationship to other Banna virus isolates found in Southeast Asia, suggesting a common evolutionary origin and potential for regional transmission.\n\nEpidemiologically, the BANV JKT-6423 strain has been detected in various mosquito species and has been associated with sporadic human cases in areas where the virus is endemic. However, its overall public health impact and potential for wider geographical spread remain areas of ongoing research and surveillance.",
