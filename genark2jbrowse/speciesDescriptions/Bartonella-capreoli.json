  "description": "Bartonella capreoli is a species of Gram-negative, intracellular bacteria that primarily infects deer and other cervid species, such as roe deer, red deer, and moose. It is a member of the Bartonella genus, which includes several species known to cause zoonotic diseases in humans.\n\nThe bacteria are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods, particularly ticks, and can establish a persistent infection in the reservoir host's bloodstream and endothelial cells. Infected animals may serve as a source of transmission to humans, who can develop a range of clinical manifestations, including fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy, in a condition known as bartonellosis.\n\nBartonella capreoli has been isolated from various wild cervid populations, and its presence has been associated with the ecology and epidemiology of other Bartonella species that can infect humans. Understanding the host-pathogen dynamics and geographical distribution of this bacterium is important for assessing the potential public health risks and implementing appropriate prevention and control measures.",
