  "description": "Bartonella doshiae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bartonella. It is a gram-negative, facultatively intracellular, and hemotropic bacterium, meaning it can live both inside and outside of host cells, particularly red blood cells.\n\nBartonella doshiae was first isolated from the blood of voles (small rodents) in the United Kingdom. It is primarily found in small mammals, such as rodents, and can be transmitted to humans through the bites or scratches of infected animals or their fleas.\n\nInfection with Bartonella doshiae in humans can lead to a condition called bartonellosis, which can manifest in various ways, including fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). However, the clinical significance and potential pathogenicity of this species in humans are not fully understood, as it is considered an emerging pathogen.\n\nTaxonomically, Bartonella doshiae is classified within the family Bartonellaceae and is closely related to other Bartonella species that are known to cause disease in humans, such as Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat-scratch disease.",
