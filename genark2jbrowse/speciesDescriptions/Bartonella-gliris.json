  "description": "Bartonella gliris is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bartonella. It is a Gram-negative, fastidious, and facultatively intracellular bacterium. Bartonella gliris is primarily found in the dormouse (Glis glis), a small rodent species native to Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nThe bacterium is transmitted through the bites or scratches of infected dormice, or through exposure to their feces or other bodily fluids. Bartonella gliris can cause a zoonotic disease in humans, known as bartonellosis, which can manifest with a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy.\n\nBartonella gliris is closely related to other Bartonella species that are known to infect various mammalian hosts, including humans. The bacterium has adapted to its specific dormouse host and can establish a persistent infection within the animal's bloodstream, from which it can be transmitted to other individuals or to humans.\n\nResearch on Bartonella gliris and its interactions with the dormouse host and potential human infections is ongoing, as understanding the ecology and epidemiology of this bacterium can contribute to the prevention and management of bartonellosis in areas where dormice are present.",
