  "description": "Bartonella japonica is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bartonella. It is a fastidious, Gram-negative, facultatively intracellular pathogen that primarily infects small mammals, particularly rodents, and can be transmitted to humans through the bites or scratches of infected animals.\n\nB. japonica was first isolated from the blood of wild Japanese mice (Apodemus speciosus) in Japan. It is closely related to other Bartonella species that cause zoonotic diseases, such as cat-scratch disease and trench fever.\n\nThe genome of B. japonica has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities, potential virulence factors, and evolutionary relationships with other Bartonella species. This information has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of this bacterial species.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to elucidate the natural history, transmission dynamics, and clinical significance of B. japonica infections in both animal reservoirs and human populations, particularly in regions where the bacterium has been detected.",
