  "description": "Bartonella phoceensis is a species of Gram-negative, facultatively intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Bartonella. It was first isolated from human blood samples in Marseille, France, and is named after the ancient Greek city of Phocaea, located in the same region.\n\nBartonella phoceensis is a small, pleomorphic, and fastidious bacterium that requires specialized media for cultivation in the laboratory. It is capable of infecting and replicating within human red blood cells and endothelial cells, which are the cells lining the interior of blood vessels.\n\nInfections with B. phoceensis have been associated with various clinical manifestations, including fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). However, the full range of disease presentations and the natural transmission routes of this bacterium are not yet fully understood.\n\nMolecular and genomic studies have shown that B. phoceensis is closely related to other Bartonella species that are known to cause human diseases, such as cat-scratch disease and Carrion's disease. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical significance of B. phoceensis infections.",
