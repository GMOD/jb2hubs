  "description": "Bathycoccus prasinos is a species of green microalgae that belongs to the order Mamiellales within the class Mamiellophyceae. It is a unicellular, non-motile, and photosynthetic organism that is typically found in marine environments, particularly in coastal and open ocean regions.\n\nBathycoccus prasinos is known for its small cell size, typically ranging from 1 to 3 micrometers in diameter. Its cells are spherical in shape and lack a rigid cell wall, instead possessing a flexible cell membrane. The cells contain a single, centrally located chloroplast, which is the organelle responsible for photosynthesis, and a single mitochondrion.\n\nThis species is considered to be a key component of the picoplankton community, which comprises the smallest photosynthetic organisms in the marine ecosystem. Bathycoccus prasinos is known to be widely distributed globally, with a preference for oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) environments, and has been observed in both surface and deep-water habitats.\n\nDue to its small size and ecological importance, Bathycoccus prasinos has been the subject of various studies in the fields of marine biology, oceanography, and microbial ecology, providing insights into the diversity, distribution, and roles of picoplankton in marine ecosystems.",
