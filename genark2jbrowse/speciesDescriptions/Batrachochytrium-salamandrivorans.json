  "description": "Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is a species of chytrid fungus that is pathogenic to salamanders and newts. It is considered an emerging infectious disease that has been causing significant population declines and mass mortality events in various amphibian species, particularly in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe fungus primarily infects the skin of salamanders and newts, disrupting their cutaneous respiration and other vital physiological functions. It can spread rapidly within host populations, leading to high rates of infection and mortality. Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is closely related to the better-known Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which is responsible for the global decline of many frog species.\n\nThe origin of Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is not fully understood, but it is believed to have emerged as a novel pathogen, potentially through the pet trade or other human-mediated activities. Its impact on amphibian biodiversity has raised significant conservation concerns, and ongoing research is focused on understanding its biology, epidemiology, and developing effective mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable salamander and newt populations.",
