  "description": "Baudoinia panamericana UAMH 10762 is a species of fungus that belongs to the Baudoinia genus. This species was first isolated from a building surface in Canada and subsequently assigned the strain identifier UAMH 10762.\n\nBaudoinia panamericana is a filamentous ascomycete fungus that is known to grow on surfaces exposed to industrial emissions, particularly near railroad tracks and coal-burning facilities. The fungus forms black, sooty colonies that can cover building facades and other structures.\n\nMorphologically, Baudoinia panamericana produces septate, branched hyphae and produces asexual spores (conidia) that are typically dark in color. The fungus is adapted to thrive in environments with high levels of airborne pollutants, particularly sulfur compounds, which it may utilize as a source of nutrients.\n\nGenetically, Baudoinia panamericana has been characterized and its DNA sequence data is available, allowing for its taxonomic placement and identification. The species is considered an important model organism for studying the biology and ecology of fungi adapted to urban and industrial environments.",
