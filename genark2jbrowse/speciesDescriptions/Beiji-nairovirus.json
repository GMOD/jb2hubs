  "description": "Beiji nairovirus is a member of the Nairovirus genus within the Bunyavirales order of viruses. It is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks belonging to the Haemaphysalis genus.\n\nBeiji nairovirus was first identified in 2015 from ticks collected in Beiji National Nature Reserve, China. Genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related to other Nairovirus species, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, that can cause severe disease in humans.\n\nThe virus has a tripartite genome consisting of small (S), medium (M), and large (L) RNA segments that encode the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. Like other nairoviruses, Beiji nairovirus is believed to primarily circulate in nature between ticks and small rodent or livestock hosts.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of Beiji nairovirus infections. Ongoing surveillance and characterization of this newly discovered virus will provide important insights into the diversity and evolution of the Nairovirus genus.",
