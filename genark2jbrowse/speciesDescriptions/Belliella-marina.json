  "description": "Belliella marina is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from seawater collected from the East China Sea.\n\nBelliella marina is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The cells are motile, possessing gliding motility.\n\nBiochemically, Belliella marina is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as agar, alginate, and carboxymethylcellulose, indicating its potential role in the degradation of complex organic matter in marine environments. The bacterium can grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Belliella marina is closely related to other members of the genus Belliella, which are commonly found in marine habitats. The species plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the marine ecosystem.",
