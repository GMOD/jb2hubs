  "description": "Belliella pelovolcani is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a volcanic mud sample collected from Pelovolcan, a mud volcano located in Mindanao, Philippines. It belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nMorphologically, Belliella pelovolcani cells are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Belliella pelovolcani is closely related to other members of the genus Belliella, which are known to inhabit various natural environments, including marine sediments, freshwater, and soil.\n\nPhysiologically, Belliella pelovolcani is aerobic and chemoorganotrophic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and obtains energy from the oxidation of organic compounds. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids as carbon and energy sources.\n\nThe species is characterized by its ability to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 37°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH, from 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH of 7.0-8.0.\n\nThe discovery and characterization of Belliella pelovolcani contribute to our understanding of the microbial diversity and adaptations in extreme environments, such as volcanic mud volcanoes, and their potential roles in biogeochemical cycles.",
