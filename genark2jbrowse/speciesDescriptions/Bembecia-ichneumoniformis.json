  "description": "Bembecia ichneumoniformis, commonly known as the Six-belted Clearwing, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sesiidae. It is a small, day-flying moth that closely resembles a wasp in appearance, with a slender body and narrow, transparent wings.\n\nThe Six-belted Clearwing has a wingspan of approximately 20-25 millimeters. Its body is dark brown or black, with yellow or orange bands across the abdomen, giving it a distinct wasp-like appearance. The wings are transparent, with dark veins and a narrow, elongated shape. This unique appearance and behavior help the moth mimic the appearance and movement of wasps, which serves as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nThe larvae of Bembecia ichneumoniformis feed on the roots and lower stems of various herbaceous plants, such as clover and other legumes. The moths are active during the day, typically found hovering around their host plants or resting on foliage.\n\nThe Six-belted Clearwing is widely distributed across Europe, ranging from the United Kingdom and Scandinavia to the Mediterranean region. It is considered a relatively common species within its range, though its population status may vary depending on local habitat conditions and land-use practices.",
