  "description": "Bergeyella porcorum is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the feces of domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus). It belongs to the genus Bergeyella, which is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nBergeyella porcorum is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 37°C (98.6°F).\n\nBiochemically, Bergeyella porcorum is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive. It is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, lactose, and sucrose, to produce acids as end products.\n\nThe genome of Bergeyella porcorum has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. This information can contribute to a better understanding of the role and interactions of this bacterial species within the gut microbiome of pigs.\n\nOverall, Bergeyella porcorum is a commensal bacterium found in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs and may play a role in the complex microbial community of the swine gut.",
