  "description": "Bergeyella zoohelcum is a species of gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and rod-shaped bacteria. It belongs to the family Weeksellaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe key features of Bergeyella zoohelcum are:\n\n1. Morphology: The cells are typically 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-2.5 μm long, occurring singly or in pairs.\n\n2. Oxygen requirements: Bergeyella zoohelcum is an aerobic bacterium, requiring oxygen for growth.\n\n3. Habitat and isolation: This species has been isolated from various animal sources, including the oral cavities of dogs and cats, as well as from human clinical samples.\n\n4. Biochemical characteristics: Bergeyella zoohelcum is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. It can ferment carbohydrates and hydrolyze esculin.\n\n5. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Bergeyella zoohelcum is closely related to other members of the Weeksellaceae family, such as the genus Weeksella.\n\nBergeyella zoohelcum is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various infections in both animals and humans, including skin and soft tissue infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and epidemiology of this bacterial species.",
