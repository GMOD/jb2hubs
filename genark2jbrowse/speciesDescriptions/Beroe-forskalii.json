  "description": "Beroe forskalii is a species of ctenophore, commonly known as a comb jelly or sea gooseberry. It belongs to the phylum Ctenophora, which are marine invertebrates that move through the water using rows of beating cilia, known as comb-like plates or ctenes.\n\nBeroe forskalii is a predatory ctenophore, primarily feeding on other ctenophores and small zooplankton. It has a rounded, gelatinous body and can grow up to several centimeters in size. The body is typically transparent, allowing the internal structures to be visible. Beroe forskalii has eight longitudinal bands of cilia that propel the animal through the water.\n\nThis species is found in tropical and subtropical marine environments, primarily in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Beroe forskalii is known for its ability to glow in the dark, a phenomenon known as bioluminescence, which is produced by specialized light-emitting cells within its body.\n\nLike other ctenophores, Beroe forskalii has a simple nervous system and a digestive system with a single opening that serves as both the mouth and anus. It reproduces sexually, with both male and female gametes being released into the water column, where fertilization occurs.",
