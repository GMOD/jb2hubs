  "description": "Betapolyomavirus hominis is a species of virus that belongs to the Betapolyomavirus genus within the Polyomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid structure and a circular, double-stranded DNA genome.\n\nBetapolyomavirus hominis is primarily found in humans and is considered a member of the human virome, the collection of viruses that naturally inhabit the human body. This virus is commonly detected in various human samples, such as skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal specimens, suggesting that it may be a relatively common and widespread virus in the human population.\n\nThe exact role and pathogenic potential of Betapolyomavirus hominis in human health are not fully understood. While some polyomaviruses have been associated with certain human diseases, the clinical significance of Betapolyomavirus hominis is still under investigation. Further research is needed to elucidate the prevalence, transmission dynamics, and potential associations of this virus with human health and disease.",
