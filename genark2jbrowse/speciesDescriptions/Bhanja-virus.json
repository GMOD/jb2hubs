  "description": "Bhanja virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is a tick-borne virus that primarily infects small mammals, such as rodents and hares, as well as humans. The virus has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that is segmented into three parts: small (S), medium (M), and large (L).\n\nBhanja virus is primarily transmitted by ticks of the Haemaphysalis and Dermacentor species, which act as both the reservoir and vector for the virus. Humans can become infected through the bite of an infected tick or by handling infected animals.\n\nInfection with Bhanja virus can cause a range of clinical symptoms in humans, including fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In some cases, the infection can lead to more severe neurological complications, such as meningoencephalitis. However, the majority of human infections are asymptomatic or present with mild, non-specific symptoms.\n\nBhanja virus is primarily found in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, with sporadic cases reported in other regions. Epidemiological studies and surveillance efforts are ongoing to better understand the distribution, prevalence, and potential public health impact of this virus.",
