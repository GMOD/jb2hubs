  "description": "Bhargavaea ullalensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Ullal, India. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically the class Gammaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Bhargavaea ullalensis are Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile with the help of flagella. They are capable of aerobic respiration and can grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 37°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Bhargavaea ullalensis is closely related to other members of the genus Bhargavaea, which are known to be soil-dwelling bacteria.\n\nThe species was named in honor of the Indian microbiologist Dr. C.V. Bhargava, who has made significant contributions to the field of microbiology in India.",
