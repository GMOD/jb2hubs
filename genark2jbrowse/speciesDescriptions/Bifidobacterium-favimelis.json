  "description": "Bifidobacterium favimelis is a species of gram-positive, anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria that belong to the genus Bifidobacterium. This species was isolated from the feces of a domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and was first described in the scientific literature in 2015.\n\nBifidobacterium favimelis is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota of rabbits and is believed to play a beneficial role in the rabbit's digestive system. Like other Bifidobacterium species, B. favimelis is known to be involved in the fermentation of carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids that can be utilized by the host.\n\nTaxonomically, B. favimelis is classified within the Bifidobacteriaceae family and the Actinobacteria phylum. Genetically, the species can be distinguished from other Bifidobacterium species based on its unique 16S rRNA gene sequence and other genomic characteristics.\n\nOverall, Bifidobacterium favimelis is an important component of the rabbit gut microbiome and has potential applications in the study of rabbit digestive health and the development of probiotic products for domestic rabbits.",
