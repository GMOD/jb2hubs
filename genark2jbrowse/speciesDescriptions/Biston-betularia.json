  "description": "Biston betularia, commonly known as the peppered moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Erebidae. This species is native to Europe and Asia and is known for its remarkable adaptation to industrial pollution.\n\nThe peppered moth is a medium-sized moth with a wingspan of around 45-55 millimeters. Its most notable feature is the striking variation in its coloration, which can range from a light, speckled gray to a dark, almost black morph. This variation is the result of a genetic polymorphism, with the darker morph being more prevalent in areas with high levels of industrial pollution.\n\nThe peppered moth's coloration serves as a form of camouflage, allowing it to blend in with the bark of trees and other natural surfaces. In areas with high pollution, the lighter-colored trees and lichens become darker, making the darker morph of the peppered moth more camouflaged and less susceptible to predation.\n\nThe peppered moth is an important model organism in the study of evolution and natural selection, as its rapid adaptation to industrial pollution has been observed and documented over the past two centuries. This species has become a classic example of the process of industrial melanism, where a population can undergo a significant change in its physical characteristics in response to environmental changes.",
