  "description": "Bizionia paragorgiae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Cytophagaceae. It was first isolated from the surface of a gorgonian coral (Paragorgia arborea) collected from the Pacific Ocean near Japan.\n\nBizionia paragorgiae is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to glide. The cells typically range in size from 0.4-0.6 μm in width and 1.2-3.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Bizionia paragorgiae is closely related to other members of the genus Bizionia, which are commonly found in marine environments, such as seawater, sediments, and associated with various marine organisms.\n\nThe species is considered psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow at low temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature range of 15-25°C. It is also halotolerant, capable of growing in the presence of moderate levels of salt.\n\nBizionia paragorgiae is believed to play a role in the microbial community associated with gorgonian corals, potentially contributing to the overall health and functioning of these important marine ecosystems.",
