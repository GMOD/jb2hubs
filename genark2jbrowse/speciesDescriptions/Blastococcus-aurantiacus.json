  "description": "Blastococcus aurantiacus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Blastococcus. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming coccoid bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Blastococcus aurantiacus are typically spherical to ovoid in shape, with a diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 micrometers. They are known to form aggregates or clusters during growth.\n\nThis species is characterized by its ability to produce orange-colored pigments, which are likely carotenoids. These pigments contribute to the distinctive orange appearance of the colonies formed by Blastococcus aurantiacus on agar media.\n\nBlastococcus aurantiacus is classified within the family Blastococcaceae, which is part of the phylum Actinobacteria. Members of this genus are known to be commonly found in soil and other terrestrial environments.\n\nThe precise ecological roles and metabolic capabilities of Blastococcus aurantiacus are not yet fully understood, and further research may provide more insights into its natural functions and potential applications.",
