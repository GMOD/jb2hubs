  "description": "Blastococcus jejuensis is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected on Jeju Island, South Korea. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of B. jejuensis are typically coccoid or ovoid in shape, with a diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 micrometers. They are non-motile and do not form any specialized structures like endospores or hyphae.\n\nPhylogenetically, B. jejuensis belongs to the genus Blastococcus, which is part of the family Geodermatophilaceae within the order Frankiales. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that B. jejuensis is closely related to other Blastococcus species.\n\nB. jejuensis is characterized by its ability to grow on a variety of organic substrates, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and some organic acids. It can tolerate a wide range of pH values, from 5.0 to 10.0, and temperatures up to 37Â°C.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology due to its ability to degrade various environmental pollutants. Further research is ongoing to explore the ecological roles and biotechnological potential of B. jejuensis.",
