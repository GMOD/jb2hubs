  "description": "Blastomyces dermatitidis ATCC 26199 is a fungal species that belongs to the genus Blastomyces, a group of dimorphic fungi. Dimorphic fungi have the ability to exist in two different forms: a yeast-like form that predominates in the host tissue, and a mold-like form that predominates in the environment.\n\nBlastomyces dermatitidis ATCC 26199 is the type strain of the species, meaning it was the first isolate used to define the characteristics of the species. This strain is commonly used in research and diagnostic applications.\n\nAs a dimorphic fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis ATCC 26199 can grow as a yeast-like form in the host, causing the disease known as blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a serious fungal infection that primarily affects the lungs and can disseminate to other organs, such as the skin, bones, and central nervous system.\n\nThe mold-like form of Blastomyces dermatitidis ATCC 26199 is typically found in soil and decaying organic matter in certain geographic regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. Infection in humans and animals typically occurs through the inhalation of fungal spores or fragments from the environment.\n\nThis strain has been extensively studied and characterized, contributing to our understanding of the biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is an important human and veterinary pathogen.",
