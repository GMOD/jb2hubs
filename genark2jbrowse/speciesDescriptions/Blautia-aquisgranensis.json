  "description": "Blautia aquisgranensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Blautia. It was first isolated from a human fecal sample collected in Aachen, Germany, and was named after the city of Aquisgranum, the Latin name for Aachen.\n\nBlautia aquisgranensis is a member of the Firmicutes phylum and the Lachnospiraceae family. It is a strictly anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. The cells of B. aquisgranensis are non-motile and non-spore-forming.\n\nBiochemically, Blautia aquisgranensis is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, to produce short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as metabolic end-products. This metabolic activity makes it an important member of the gut microbiome, where it contributes to the overall gut health and nutrient production.\n\nThe presence of Blautia aquisgranensis has been associated with various aspects of human health, including a potential role in maintaining a balanced gut microbiome and potentially providing beneficial effects on the host's immune system and metabolic functions. However, further research is needed to fully understand the specific roles and interactions of this species within the complex gut microbial community.",
