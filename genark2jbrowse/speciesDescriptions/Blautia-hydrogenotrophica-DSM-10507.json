  "description": "Blautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the genus Blautia. This species was isolated from human fecal samples and is known for its ability to utilize hydrogen and carbon dioxide as energy sources through a process called hydrogenotrophy.\n\nBlautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 is a rod-shaped bacterium that measures approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-5.0 μm in length. It is non-motile and can form terminal or subterminal endospores. The bacterium is considered a strict anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Blautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 is its ability to use hydrogen and carbon dioxide as its primary energy and carbon sources, respectively. This metabolic capability allows the bacterium to thrive in environments with high levels of these gases, such as the human gut. The bacterium is also known to produce acetate as a major fermentation end-product.\n\nBlautia hydrogenotrophica DSM 10507 is considered an important member of the human gut microbiome, as it plays a role in maintaining the overall balance and diversity of the microbial community. It has been studied for its potential benefits in human health, including its possible involvement in the regulation of energy metabolism and the production of beneficial metabolites.",
