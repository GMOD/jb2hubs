  "description": "Blautia luti is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the genus Blautia. It was originally isolated from a mud sample collected from a wetland environment.\n\nThe cells of Blautia luti are typically rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-4.0 μm in length. They are non-motile and do not possess flagella. The bacterium is capable of forming endospores, which allows it to survive unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nBlautia luti is a chemoorganotroph, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, producing acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the main end products.\n\nThis species is considered an anaerobe, as it requires an anoxic (oxygen-free) environment for growth. It is mesophilic, with an optimal growth temperature range of 30-37°C.\n\nBlautia luti is found naturally in soil and sediment environments, particularly in wetlands and other anaerobic habitats. Its ecological role likely involves the degradation of complex organic matter and the cycling of nutrients within these ecosystems.",
