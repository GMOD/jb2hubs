  "description": "Blautia marasmi is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium. It belongs to the genus Blautia, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and order Clostridiales.\n\nBlautia marasmi was first isolated from the fecal samples of a patient with Marasmus, a form of severe malnutrition. The bacterium is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, producing acetate, lactate, and other short-chain fatty acids as the end products of its metabolism.\n\nThis species is considered an important commensal member of the human gut microbiome and has been found to be associated with a healthy intestinal environment. It is believed to play a role in maintaining gut homeostasis and potentially contributing to the prevention or alleviation of certain gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the specific ecological functions and clinical significance of Blautia marasmi within the complex gut microbial community.",
