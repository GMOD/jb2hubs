  "description": "Blennius ocellaris, commonly known as the butterfly blenny, is a small species of blenny fish found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It belongs to the family Blenniidae.\n\nThe butterfly blenny is a small, elongated fish that typically grows to a maximum length of around 12 centimeters (4.7 inches). Its body is laterally compressed and covered with small, smooth scales. The head is large and the mouth is terminal, with a protruding upper lip.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of this species is the presence of a large, circular eyespot-like pattern on the dorsal fin, which gives the impression of a large eye. This eyespot is believed to be a form of mimicry, serving as a defense mechanism to deter potential predators by making the fish appear larger and more formidable.\n\nButterfly blennies are generally found in shallow, coastal waters, often associated with rocky habitats and seagrass beds. They are typically found at depths ranging from a few meters to around 50 meters (165 feet). These fish are known to be relatively sedentary, spending much of their time resting in crevices or hiding among the vegetation.\n\nThe diet of the butterfly blenny consists mainly of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and mollusks, which it forages for in its habitat. Reproduction in this species involves the males establishing and defending territories, and the females laying their eggs within the male's territory, where they are then guarded and cared for by the male.",
