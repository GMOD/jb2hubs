  "description": "Boaedon fuliginosus, commonly known as the brown house snake or the brown snake, is a non-venomous species of snake belonging to the family Lamprophiidae. This species is native to parts of Africa, including East and Central Africa.\n\nDescription:\nBoaedon fuliginosus is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 60 to 120 cm in length. The body is relatively stout and the head is slightly distinct from the neck. The dorsal coloration is predominantly brown or greyish-brown, with a lighter ventral surface. The scales are smooth and the pupil is round.\n\nHabitat and Ecology:\nBoaedon fuliginosus is found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, woodlands, and even urban areas. It is a terrestrial and nocturnal species, often found in and around human dwellings, where it preys on small rodents and other small vertebrates. The snake is a constrictor, using its coils to subdue and kill its prey before swallowing it whole.\n\nReproduction and Life Cycle:\nBoaedon fuliginosus is ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the young are born live. The female gives birth to a litter of 4 to 12 offspring, which are independent from birth and capable of feeding on their own.\n\nConservation Status:\nBoaedon fuliginosus is classified as a Least Concern species by the IUCN Red List, as it is widespread and adaptable to various habitats, including human-modified environments.",
