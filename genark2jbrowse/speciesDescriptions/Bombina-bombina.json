  "description": "Bombina bombina, commonly known as the European fire-bellied toad, is a species of small, brightly colored amphibian belonging to the family Bombinatoridae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, where it inhabits various freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.\n\nThe European fire-bellied toad is characterized by its distinctive appearance, with a warty, olive-green or brown back and a bright orange or red underside. This vivid coloration serves as a warning signal to potential predators, as the toad secretes a toxic skin substance that can be harmful if ingested.\n\nThese toads are primarily nocturnal and are known for their unique mating call, which is described as a high-pitched, nasal \"brekeke\" or \"pu-pu-pu\" sound. During the breeding season, the males gather in shallow water bodies to attract females with their calls.\n\nBombina bombina plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a predator of small invertebrates and as a prey item for various predators, including birds, snakes, and larger amphibians. The species is also considered a valuable indicator of environmental health, as it is sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat conditions.",
