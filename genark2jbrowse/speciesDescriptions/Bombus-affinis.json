  "description": "Bombus affinis, commonly known as the rusty patched bumble bee, is a species of bumble bee native to eastern North America. It is a medium-sized bee with a distinctive rusty-colored patch on its abdomen.\n\nThe Bombus affinis has a robust, hairy body that is typically black in color, with a reddish-orange patch on the second abdominal segment. The species is an important pollinator, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem by contributing to the pollination of various plant species.\n\nBombus affinis is known for its social behavior, living in colonies with a queen and a hierarchy of workers. The colonies are typically small, with a few hundred individuals at most. The bees collect pollen and nectar from a variety of flowering plants, which they use to feed the colony and their young.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bombus affinis has experienced a significant decline in population over the past few decades, primarily due to habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. This species is currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in the United States, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect this important pollinator.",
