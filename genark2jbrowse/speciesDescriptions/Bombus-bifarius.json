  "description": "Bombus bifarius, commonly known as the two-banded bumblebee, is a species of bumblebee native to western North America. It is a member of the genus Bombus, which includes over 250 species of bumblebees found worldwide.\n\nPhysically, Bombus bifarius is a medium-sized bumblebee with a distinct pattern of two broad yellow bands on its abdomen, giving it its common name. The rest of its body is predominantly black, with some yellowish-white hairs on the thorax and legs. Like other bumblebees, it has a robust, hairy body and short, stout legs adapted for foraging and nesting.\n\nEcologically, Bombus bifarius plays an important role as a pollinator, feeding on the nectar and pollen of a variety of flowering plants, including many agricultural crops. Its colonies are typically small, with a single queen and a few dozen worker bees. The colonies are annual, with new queens mating in the fall and overwintering before establishing a new colony the following spring.\n\nBombus bifarius is widely distributed across the western United States and Canada, ranging from British Columbia to California and east to the Rocky Mountains. It inhabits a variety of natural and managed habitats, including meadows, forests, and agricultural areas. However, like many bumblebee species, Bombus bifarius has experienced population declines in recent decades due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change.",
