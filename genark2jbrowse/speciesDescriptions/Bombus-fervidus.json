  "description": "Bombus fervidus, commonly known as the golden northern bumblebee, is a species of bumblebee native to North America. It is a member of the family Apidae and the genus Bombus.\n\nThe Bombus fervidus is a medium-sized bumblebee, typically measuring between 16-22 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive golden-yellow coloration on its thorax and abdomen, with black bands on the abdomen. The legs and face are also black.\n\nBombus fervidus is an important pollinator, visiting a wide variety of flowering plants, including crops, wildflowers, and ornamental plants. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem by facilitating the reproduction of these plants through pollination.\n\nThe bees live in underground nests, typically in abandoned rodent burrows or other small cavities. The colonies are annual, with a single queen producing workers and new queens and males during the course of the season.\n\nBombus fervidus is widely distributed across North America, ranging from Canada to the United States and Mexico. However, like many bumblebee species, it has experienced population declines in recent years due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change.\n\nConservation efforts to protect Bombus fervidus and other bumblebee species are essential, as they contribute significantly to the overall health and biodiversity of natural and agricultural ecosystems.",
