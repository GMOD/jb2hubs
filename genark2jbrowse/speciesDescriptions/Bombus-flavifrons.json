  "description": "Bombus flavifrons, commonly known as the yellow-fronted bumblebee, is a species of bumblebee found in North America. It belongs to the genus Bombus, which includes over 250 species of bumblebees worldwide.\n\nThe yellow-fronted bumblebee is characterized by its distinctive coloration, with a yellow face, thorax, and abdomen. The head is relatively large, and the eyes are compound. The legs and antennae are black. Bumblebees, in general, are important pollinators, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem by facilitating the transfer of pollen between flowering plants.\n\nBombus flavifrons typically constructs its nests underground, often utilizing abandoned rodent burrows or other cavities. The colonies are annual, with a queen and a workforce of female workers. The queen is responsible for initiating the colony and laying eggs, while the workers collect nectar and pollen to support the colony's growth and development.\n\nThe yellow-fronted bumblebee is found in various habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and forested areas, across the western and central regions of North America. It is known to pollinate a wide range of flowering plants, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem health in its native range.",
