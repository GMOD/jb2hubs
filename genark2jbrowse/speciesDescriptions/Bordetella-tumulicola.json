  "description": "Bordetella tumulicola is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bordetella. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, coccobacillary bacterium. Bordetella tumulicola was first isolated from soil samples collected from a mound (tumulus) in South Korea.\n\nThe key characteristics of Bordetella tumulicola are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Coccobacillary, with a size range of 0.4-0.6 μm in width and 0.8-1.2 μm in length.\n\n2. Colony appearance: On agar plates, the colonies are circular, convex, and off-white in color.\n\n3. Physiology: Bordetella tumulicola is an aerobic bacterium, capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C.\n\n4. Biochemical properties: The bacterium is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive. It can utilize a variety of carbon sources, such as glucose, sucrose, and fructose, for energy production.\n\n5. Genomic characteristics: The genome of Bordetella tumulicola has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome with approximately 4.2 million base pairs and a G+C content of around 68%.\n\nBordetella tumulicola is considered an environmental bacterium, as it was isolated from soil samples. Its specific ecological role and potential interactions with other soil microorganisms are currently under investigation.",
