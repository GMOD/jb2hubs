  "description": "Borna disease virus 2 (BoDV-2) is a newly discovered member of the Bornaviridae family, which belongs to the order Mononegavirales. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects small mammals, such as shrews and rodents.\n\nBoDV-2 was first identified in 2018 after being isolated from a dead shrew in Germany. Subsequent studies have revealed that this virus is genetically distinct from the previously known Borna disease virus (BoDV-1), which is the causative agent of Borna disease in horses and other animals.\n\nThe genome of BoDV-2 is approximately 8.9 kilobases in length and encodes six main proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunits (L and X). These proteins are essential for the virus's replication, assembly, and interaction with host cells.\n\nBoDV-2 is believed to have a natural reservoir in shrew populations and can potentially infect other small mammals. However, the full host range and ecological dynamics of this virus are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of this newly discovered Borna disease virus.",
