It is found in the Southern Ocean, primarily in the Antarctic region.\n\nKey features:\n\n1. Body shape: Elongated, cylindrical body with a large, terminal mouth and a long, slender tail.\n2. Coloration: Dark brown or black in color, which helps with camouflage in the deep, dark ocean environment.\n3. Photophores: Bioluminescent light-producing organs (photophores) are present along the body, which are used for communication, prey attraction, and camouflage.\n4. Dentition: Sharp, needle-like teeth that are adapted for catching and consuming small prey, such as other fish and crustaceans.\n5. Habitat: Inhabits the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones of the ocean, typically found at depths ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters.\n6. Feeding behavior: An ambush predator, Borostomias antarcticus waits in the water column to ambush and capture its prey using its sharp teeth.\n\nThis species plays a role in the deep-sea ecosystem as a predator, contributing to the food web and energy transfer in the Antarctic ocean environment.",
