  "description": "Bos javanicus, commonly known as the Javan banteng or Bali cattle, is a species of wild cattle native to the island of Java in Indonesia. It is a member of the genus Bos, which includes domestic cattle and several other wild bovine species.\n\nThe Javan banteng is a medium-sized bovine, with a shoulder height of around 1.4 to 1.6 meters. It has a distinctive reddish-brown coat color, with a white rump patch and white legs. Both males and females possess horns, which are typically short and curved inwards.\n\nBos javanicus is adapted to live in tropical forest and grassland habitats, and it is known to be a relatively agile and fast-moving species compared to other wild bovines. They are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses and other vegetation.\n\nThe Javan banteng is considered a threatened species, with declining populations due to habitat loss, poaching, and competition with domestic livestock. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique wild bovine species and its remaining populations in Indonesia.",
