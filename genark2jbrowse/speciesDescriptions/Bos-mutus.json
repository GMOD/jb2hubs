  "description": "Bos mutus, commonly known as the wild yak, is a species of large bovine native to the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest extant wild bovid species, with adult males weighing up to 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and standing up to 2 meters (6.6 ft) tall at the shoulder.\n\nBos mutus is well-adapted to the high-altitude, cold, and harsh environments of its native range. It has a thick, woolly coat that insulates it from the extreme temperatures, and it can thrive on a diet of grasses, sedges, and other hardy vegetation found in the region. The wild yak is an excellent climber and can navigate the rugged, mountainous terrain with ease.\n\nGenetically, Bos mutus is closely related to the domestic yak (Bos grunniens), and the two species are capable of interbreeding. However, the wild yak maintains distinct morphological and behavioral characteristics, such as its larger size, more aggressive temperament, and greater endurance.\n\nConservation efforts are underway to protect the wild yak, which is classified as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Threats to the species include habitat loss, competition with domestic livestock, and hunting for its meat and hides.",
