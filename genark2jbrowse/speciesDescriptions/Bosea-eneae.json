  "description": "Bosea eneae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bosea, which is a member of the family Xanthobacteraceae. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium. Bosea eneae was first isolated from the rhizosphere of the plant Oenothera eneae, which is a species of evening primrose native to Europe.\n\nCells of Bosea eneae are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is motile, possessing a single polar flagellum. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. Bosea eneae is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids, as carbon and energy sources for its metabolism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Bosea eneae is closely related to other species within the genus Bosea, which are known to play important roles in nutrient cycling and plant-microbe interactions in various terrestrial environments.",
