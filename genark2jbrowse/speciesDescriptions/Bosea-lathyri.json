  "description": "Bosea lathyri is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bosea, which is a member of the family Bosaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria. This species was isolated from the root nodules of the legume plant Lathyrus latifolius (perennial pea).\n\nBosea lathyri is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium. It is capable of nitrogen fixation, a process in which atmospheric nitrogen is converted into ammonia, which can be utilized by plants for growth and development. This symbiotic relationship between the bacteria and the legume plant is an important aspect of the species' ecology.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Bosea lathyri is closely related to other Bosea species, which are known to be associated with various plant hosts and have the ability to form root nodules. The specific role and interactions of Bosea lathyri within the root nodule and the broader plant-microbe ecosystem are still being investigated by researchers.",
