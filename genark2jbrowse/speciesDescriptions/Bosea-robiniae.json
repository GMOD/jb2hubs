  "description": "Bosea robiniae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bosea, which is a part of the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nBosea robiniae was first isolated from the root nodules of the black locust tree (Robinia pseudoacacia), a nitrogen-fixing legume, hence the specific epithet \"robiniae.\" It is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen and forming a symbiotic relationship with the host plant.\n\nThe cells of Bosea robiniae are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to move using flagella. They have an optimal growth temperature range of 25-30Â°C and can thrive in a neutral to slightly alkaline pH environment.\n\nTaxonomically, Bosea robiniae is classified within the family Bosea, which is known for its members' ability to form symbiotic associations with plants, particularly legumes. This species plays a role in the nitrogen cycle and can contribute to the fertility of the soil through its nitrogen-fixing capabilities.",
