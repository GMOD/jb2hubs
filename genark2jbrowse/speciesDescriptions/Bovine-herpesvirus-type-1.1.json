  "description": "Bovine herpesvirus type 1.1 (BHV-1.1) is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects cattle and can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IPV), and infectious balanoposthitis (IB).\n\nBHV-1.1 is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces. Upon infection, the virus can establish a lifelong latent infection in the sensory ganglia of the host, with the potential for reactivation and subsequent shedding under certain physiological or environmental stressors.\n\nThe virus utilizes the host's cellular machinery to replicate, leading to the production of new viral particles that can infect other susceptible cells and animals. The clinical symptoms associated with BHV-1.1 infection can range from mild respiratory signs to more severe manifestations, such as abortion, neonatal mortality, and immunosuppression, which can predispose the host to secondary bacterial or viral infections.\n\nEffective control and prevention of BHV-1.1 infection in cattle populations often involve a combination of vaccination, biosecurity measures, and strategic herd management practices to minimize the risk of transmission and maintain herd health.",
