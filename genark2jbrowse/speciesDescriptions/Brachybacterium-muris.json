  "description": "Brachybacterium muris is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brachybacterium. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium. Brachybacterium muris was first isolated from the feces of laboratory mice.\n\nThe cells of Brachybacterium muris are typically 0.8-1.2 Î¼m in diameter and occur singly or in pairs. They are non-motile and do not form endospores. The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative.\n\nBrachybacterium muris is a chemoheterotrophic organism, meaning it requires organic carbon sources for growth and energy production. It is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as well as some amino acids.\n\nPhylogenetically, Brachybacterium muris is closely related to other species within the genus Brachybacterium, which are commonly found in a variety of environmental niches, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals.\n\nThe role and significance of Brachybacterium muris in the mouse gut microbiome or its potential interactions with the host are still under investigation, as the species has only recently been described and characterized.",
