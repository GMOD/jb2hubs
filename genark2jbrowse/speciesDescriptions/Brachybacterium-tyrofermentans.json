  "description": "Brachybacterium tyrofermentans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brachybacterium, which is a part of the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium.\n\nThe key features of Brachybacterium tyrofermentans are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are coccoid, occurring singly or in pairs, and measuring approximately 0.5-1.0 Î¼m in diameter.\n\n2. Oxygen requirement: It is an aerobic bacterium, requiring oxygen for growth.\n\n3. Pigmentation: The colonies formed by this species are yellowish-white in color.\n\n4. Biochemical characteristics: Brachybacterium tyrofermentans is able to ferment various carbohydrates, including glucose, lactose, and sucrose, and can produce lactic acid as a end-product of this fermentation.\n\n5. Habitat: This species has been isolated from dairy products, such as cheese, where it may play a role in the fermentation and maturation processes.\n\n6. Taxonomy and phylogeny: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Brachybacterium tyrofermentans is closely related to other Brachybacterium species, and is classified within the family Brachybacteriaceae.\n\nOverall, Brachybacterium tyrofermentans is a coccoid, aerobic, lactic acid-producing bacterium that is commonly found in dairy environments and may contribute to the development of cheese flavors and textures.",
