  "description": "Bradysia coprophila is a species of fungus gnat belonging to the family Sciaridae. It is commonly known as the dung midge or dung gnat due to its association with decaying organic matter, particularly animal feces.\n\nBradysia coprophila is a small, delicate fly with a body length typically ranging from 2 to 4 millimeters. It has a slender, elongated body, long legs, and a pair of membranous wings. The gnat's coloration is generally dark, often appearing black or dark brown in appearance.\n\nThe life cycle of Bradysia coprophila involves a complete metamorphosis, with distinct egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larvae, or maggots, are small, white, and worm-like in appearance, and they feed on the microorganisms and decaying organic matter found in their habitats, which can include soil, compost, and animal manure.\n\nBradysia coprophila is widely distributed globally and is commonly found in areas with high levels of organic matter, such as agricultural settings, gardens, and waste management facilities. While not considered a major agricultural pest, the presence of these gnats can be an indicator of poor sanitation or high levels of decomposing organic material.",
