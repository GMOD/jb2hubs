  "description": "Branchiostoma belcheri, also known as Belcher's lancelet or the Chinese lancelet, is a small, free-swimming marine invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Cephalochordata. This species is commonly found in the coastal waters of East Asia, particularly in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.\n\nBranchiostoma belcheri is a filter-feeding organism that uses its hair-like cilia to draw in water, which is then filtered for microscopic food particles. It has a slender, elongated body with no distinct head, eyes, or limbs, and its internal anatomy is relatively simple compared to vertebrates.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of Branchiostoma belcheri is its notochord, a flexible rod-like structure that runs along the length of its body and serves as a precursor to the vertebral column in higher chordates. The species also possesses a dorsal nerve cord, a structure that is considered a primitive form of the central nervous system found in vertebrates.\n\nBranchiostoma belcheri is an important model organism in the study of the evolutionary origins of chordates and the development of vertebrate-like features. Its simplistic anatomy and phylogenetic position make it a valuable tool for understanding the early evolution of the chordate lineage and the transition from invertebrate to vertebrate forms.",
