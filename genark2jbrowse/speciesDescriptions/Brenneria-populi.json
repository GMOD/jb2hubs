  "description": "Brenneria populi is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the bark of Populus euphratica (Euphrates poplar) trees. It belongs to the genus Brenneria, which is a group of gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria.\n\nThe cells of Brenneria populi are rod-shaped and motile, with peritrichous flagella. They are capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C.\n\nBiochemically, Brenneria populi is characterized by its ability to hydrolyze esculin and produce acid from various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. It is also positive for catalase and oxidase activities.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Brenneria populi is closely related to other Brenneria species, particularly Brenneria nigrifluens and Brenneria salicis, which are also associated with tree hosts.\n\nThe ecological role of Brenneria populi within the Populus euphratica tree microbiome is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be involved in nutrient cycling or potentially plant-pathogenic interactions, as some Brenneria species are known to cause diseases in certain tree species.",
