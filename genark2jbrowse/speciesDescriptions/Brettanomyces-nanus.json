  "description": "Brettanomyces nanus is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Brettanomyces. It is a non-spore-forming, ellipsoidal to elongated yeast that typically measures around 2-5 micrometers in size.\n\nBrettanomyces nanus is known for its ability to ferment a wide range of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, and maltose. It is often associated with the production of unique flavors and aromas in certain fermented beverages, such as wine, cider, and beer.\n\nThis yeast species is considered to be a part of the \"wild\" or \"non-Saccharomyces\" yeast group, which can contribute to the complexity and character of fermented products when used in combination with other yeast strains. Brettanomyces nanus is known for its ability to produce various esters, phenolic compounds, and volatile acids that can impart distinctive sensory characteristics to the final product.\n\nDue to its versatility and potential contributions to the flavor profile of fermented beverages, Brettanomyces nanus is an important species in the field of oenology, brewing, and cider-making, where it is often utilized in controlled and managed fermentation processes.",
