  "description": "Brevibacterium ammoniilyticum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevibacterium. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nThe cells of B. ammoniilyticum are typically rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They are non-motile and do not form endospores.\n\nThis species is capable of utilizing ammonium as a sole source of nitrogen for growth, which is reflected in its species name \"ammoniilyticum,\" meaning \"ammonium-decomposing.\" It is also able to grow in the presence of oxygen (facultatively anaerobic).\n\nB. ammoniilyticum was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan. It is a chemoheterotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon sources from organic compounds in its environment.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and nitrogen cycling processes due to its ability to utilize ammonium as a nitrogen source. Further research is ongoing to explore the ecological roles and biotechnological potential of B. ammoniilyticum.",
