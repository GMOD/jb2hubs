  "description": "Brevibacterium ihuae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevibacterium. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Brevibacterium ihuae was first isolated from a water sample collected from the Ihua River in China.\n\nThe cells of Brevibacterium ihuae are typically short, rod-shaped, and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are usually smooth, circular, and creamy-white in color.\n\nBrevibacterium ihuae is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nBiochemically, Brevibacterium ihuae is able to hydrolyze casein and gelatin, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for energy production. The bacterium is also known to produce carotenoid pigments, which contribute to the creamy-white appearance of its colonies.\n\nThe genome of Brevibacterium ihuae has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic and metabolic characteristics. This information can be useful for understanding the ecological roles and potential applications of this bacterial species in various fields, such as biotechnology or environmental microbiology.",
