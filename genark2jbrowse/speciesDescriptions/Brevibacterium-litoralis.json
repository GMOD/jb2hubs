  "description": "Brevibacterium litoralis is a species of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevibacterium. It was first isolated from a coastal sediment sample collected in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of B. litoralis are short, rod-shaped, and approximately 0.5-0.8 µm in width and 1.0-2.5 µm in length. They are non-motile and do not form endospores. The colonies of B. litoralis on agar plates are typically yellow-pigmented, smooth, and circular in shape.\n\nPhylogenetically, B. litoralis is closely related to other Brevibacterium species, such as B. casei and B. linens, which are commonly found in dairy products and cheese-ripening environments. However, B. litoralis was isolated from a marine environment, suggesting its adaptation to saline conditions.\n\nBiochemically, B. litoralis is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources. The optimum growth temperature for B. litoralis is around 30°C, and it can tolerate salt concentrations up to 10% NaCl.\n\nThe identification and characterization of B. litoralis contribute to our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of Brevibacterium species in various environments, including marine sediments and coastal ecosystems.",
