  "description": "Brevibacterium samyangense is a species of gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria. It was first isolated from soil samples collected from Samyang, South Korea.\n\nThe key characteristics of Brevibacterium samyangense are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are short rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 0.8-1.5 μm in length.\n\n2. Colony appearance: Colonies on agar plates are circular, smooth, convex, and yellowish-white in color.\n\n3. Physiological properties: The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It can grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C.\n\n4. Chemotaxonomic features: The cell wall contains peptidoglycan with L-lysine as the diamino acid. The major cellular fatty acids are anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0.\n\n5. Genomic characteristics: The G+C content of the genomic DNA is approximately 68 mol%.\n\nBrevibacterium samyangense is closely related to other Brevibacterium species, such as Brevibacterium casei and Brevibacterium linens, which are commonly found in dairy products and cheese-ripening environments. The ecological role and potential applications of B. samyangense are still under investigation.",
