  "description": "Brevundimonas aurantiaca is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria. It belongs to the genus Brevundimonas, which is a member of the family Caulobacteraceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of B. aurantiaca are typically short, rod-shaped, and motile with a single polar flagellum. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are usually circular, convex, and have an orange or yellowish-orange pigmentation.\n\nB. aurantiaca is considered an environmental bacterium, as it has been isolated from various natural sources, such as soil, freshwater, and marine environments. It is known to be capable of degrading a variety of organic compounds and can thrive in oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) conditions.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology due to its versatile metabolic capabilities. However, its precise ecological roles and interactions within natural microbial communities are still being investigated.",
