  "description": "Brevundimonas bullata is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevundimonas, which is a member of the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Brevundimonas bullata are typically short, rod-shaped, and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum.\n\nBrevundimonas bullata is classified as a strict aerobe, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and energy production. It is capable of oxidizing a variety of organic compounds, including carbohydrates, alcohols, and organic acids, as its energy sources.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from freshwater environments and has been found in various aquatic habitats, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Brevundimonas bullata is considered a non-pathogenic bacterium and is not typically associated with causing disease in humans or other organisms.\n\nThe genome of Brevundimonas bullata has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, adaptation to aquatic environments, and potential ecological roles in nutrient cycling and microbial community dynamics.",
