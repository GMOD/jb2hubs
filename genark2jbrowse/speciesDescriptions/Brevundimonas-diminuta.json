  "description": "Brevundimonas diminuta is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile bacteria belonging to the genus Brevundimonas. It is characterized by its small cell size, typically ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 micrometers in width and 0.6 to 1.2 micrometers in length.\n\nBrevundimonas diminuta is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It is considered an oligotrophic organism, capable of thriving in nutrient-poor environments. The bacterium is often found in soil, freshwater, and marine environments.\n\nOne of the notable features of B. diminuta is its resistance to various disinfectants and antibiotics, making it a potential concern in certain clinical and industrial settings. The species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology due to its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.\n\nOverall, Brevundimonas diminuta is a small, versatile bacterium that has garnered scientific interest for its unique characteristics and potential practical applications.",
