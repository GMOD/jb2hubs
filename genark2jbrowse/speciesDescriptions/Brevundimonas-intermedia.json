  "description": "Brevundimonas intermedia is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevundimonas. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Brevundimonas intermedia are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, with a single polar flagellum that enables their movement.\n\nBrevundimonas intermedia is considered an oligotrophic bacterium, meaning it can thrive in environments with low nutrient availability. It has been isolated from various sources, including water, soil, and clinical samples.\n\nThis species is known to be capable of degrading a variety of organic compounds, including some pollutants. It has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and environmental cleanup processes.\n\nBrevundimonas intermedia is taxonomically classified within the phylum Proteobacteria, class Alphaproteobacteria, and order Caulobacterales. It is closely related to other species within the Brevundimonas genus, which are known for their distinctive cell morphology and ecological roles.",
