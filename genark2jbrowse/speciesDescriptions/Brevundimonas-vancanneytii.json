  "description": "Brevundimonas vancanneytii is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It belongs to the genus Brevundimonas, which is a member of the family Caulobacteraceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Brevundimonas vancanneytii are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They exhibit a distinctive stalked morphology, which is a characteristic feature of the Caulobacteraceae family.\n\nThis species was first isolated from drinking water in Belgium and named after the Belgian microbiologist, Jean Vancement, who contributed significantly to the study of Caulobacteraceae.\n\nBrevundimonas vancanneytii is considered an oligotrophic bacterium, meaning it can thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It has been found in various aquatic habitats, including freshwater, seawater, and drinking water distribution systems.\n\nThe genome of Brevundimonas vancanneytii has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to its ecological niche. This information has contributed to a better understanding of the role of this bacterium in aquatic ecosystems and its potential applications in water treatment processes.",
