  "description": "Brevundimonas viscosa is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevundimonas. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Brevundimonas viscosa is characterized by its ability to produce a viscous, slimy extracellular polysaccharide, which gives the bacterial cells a sticky or mucoid appearance.\n\nThis species was initially isolated from a drinking water distribution system and has since been found in various aquatic environments, including freshwater, seawater, and wastewater treatment plants. Brevundimonas viscosa is considered an environmental bacterium and is not typically associated with human or animal infections.\n\nThe genome of Brevundimonas viscosa has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to aquatic environments. This bacterium is known to be able to degrade various organic compounds and may play a role in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Brevundimonas viscosa is a well-studied environmental bacterium that has garnered interest due to its unique slimy extracellular polysaccharide production and potential applications in bioremediation or wastewater treatment processes.",
