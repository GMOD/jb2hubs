  "description": "Brucella abortus 544 is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium that belongs to the genus Brucella. It is the causative agent of brucellosis, a zoonotic disease primarily affecting cattle, but can also infect humans.\n\nBrucella abortus 544 is a small, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium that is non-motile and does not form spores. It is an aerobic organism, requiring oxygen for growth, and is capable of surviving and replicating within the host's phagocytic cells, such as macrophages.\n\nThe bacterium is known for its ability to cause spontaneous abortion, or \"abortion storms,\" in infected cattle, leading to significant economic losses in the dairy and beef industries. In humans, Brucella abortus 544 can cause a range of non-specific symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and joint pain, which can lead to a debilitating condition known as undulant fever.\n\nBrucella abortus 544 is considered a potential bioterrorism agent due to its ability to infect humans through various routes, including inhalation, ingestion, and direct contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. Proper biosafety measures and effective treatment protocols are essential for controlling the spread of this pathogen.",
