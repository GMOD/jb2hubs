  "description": "Brucella anthropi is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with rare cases of human infection, primarily in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nBrucella anthropi is a small, Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccobacillus. It is classified as a facultative intracellular bacterium, meaning it can survive and replicate within the host's cells, particularly macrophages.\n\nUnlike the more well-known Brucella species that cause brucellosis, a serious infectious disease in humans and animals, Brucella anthropi is generally less virulent and is considered an atypical Brucella species. However, it has been reported to cause a range of clinical manifestations, including bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and soft tissue infections, primarily in individuals with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe natural reservoir and transmission routes of Brucella anthropi are not fully understood, but it has been isolated from various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and even medical devices and equipment. Appropriate antibiotic treatment, based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing, is generally required for the management of Brucella anthropi infections.",
