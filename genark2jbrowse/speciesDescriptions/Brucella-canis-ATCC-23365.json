  "description": "Brucella canis ATCC 23365 is a species of Gram-negative, facultatively intracellular, coccobacillary bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella. It is the causative agent of canine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease primarily affecting dogs.\n\nThe key features of Brucella canis ATCC 23365 are:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a small, non-motile, non-spore-forming coccobacillus, typically measuring 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 0.6-1.5 μm in length.\n\n2. Growth characteristics: Brucella canis is a slow-growing bacterium, requiring 3-7 days for colony formation on enriched media such as Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA) or Brucella Agar. The colonies are small, smooth, and convex.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: The bacterium is oxidase-positive, catalase-positive, and does not reduce nitrates. It has a requirement for carbon dioxide (CO2) for optimal growth.\n\n4. Pathogenicity: Brucella canis is considered a zoonotic pathogen, meaning it can be transmitted from infected dogs to humans, causing a disease known as canine brucellosis or dog brucellosis. The infection can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including reproductive problems, such as infertility, abortion, and orchitis in male dogs, as well as flu-like symptoms in humans.\n\n5. Epidemiology: Brucella canis is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their secretions, or contaminated environments. The disease is widespread in many regions, particularly in areas with a high population of stray or free-roaming dogs.\n\n6. Identification and diagnosis: Brucella canis can be identified through various laboratory techniques, including culture, serological tests, and molecular methods, such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).\n\nOverall, Brucella canis ATCC 23365 is an important pathogen in the veterinary and public health fields, as it can cause significant health issues in both dogs and humans.",
