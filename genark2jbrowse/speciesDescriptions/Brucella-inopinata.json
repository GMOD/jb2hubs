  "description": "Brucella inopinata is a species of gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacteria. It is a member of the genus Brucella, which are known to cause brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and animals.\n\nBrucella inopinata was first isolated in 2008 from a human patient with a history of breast implant infection. This species is considered an atypical Brucella species, as it displays some distinct characteristics that differentiate it from other well-known Brucella species.\n\nThe genome of Brucella inopinata is still under investigation, but it is believed to have a circular chromosome and potentially a second chromosome or plasmid. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 28-37Â°C and a pH range of 6.6-7.4.\n\nBrucella inopinata is primarily associated with localized infections, such as breast implant infections, and its pathogenicity and host range are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, virulence factors, and potential public health implications of this emerging Brucella species.",
