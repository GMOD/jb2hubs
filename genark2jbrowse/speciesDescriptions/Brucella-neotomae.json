  "description": "Brucella neotomae is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccobacillus-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella. It is primarily found in the desert woodrat (Neotoma lepida), a small rodent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\nBrucella neotomae is considered a zoonotic pathogen, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans, causing a disease known as brucellosis. However, compared to other Brucella species, Brucella neotomae is considered less virulent and less likely to cause human infection.\n\nThe bacteria can be isolated from the tissues, lymph nodes, and reproductive organs of infected desert woodrats. Transmission to humans typically occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their tissues, or by consuming unpasteurized dairy products from infected animals.\n\nBrucella neotomae is closely related to other Brucella species, such as Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus, but can be distinguished by its unique biochemical and genetic characteristics. Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of Brucella neotomae is important for the prevention and control of brucellosis in both animal and human populations.",
