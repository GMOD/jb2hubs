  "description": "Brucella pseudintermedia is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella. Brucella is a group of Gram-negative, coccobacillary, and intracellular bacteria that are known to cause brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that can affect various mammalian species, including humans.\n\nBrucella pseudintermedia is a relatively rare species within the Brucella genus and was first isolated and characterized in the late 20th century. It is closely related to other Brucella species, such as Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus, but can be distinguished from them through molecular and phenotypic methods.\n\nThe bacteria are typically slow-growing, requiring specialized culture media and incubation conditions for isolation and identification. Brucella pseudintermedia is known to have a broad host range, with the ability to infect various animal species, including cattle, sheep, goats, and even humans, though it is less common in human infections compared to other Brucella species.\n\nLike other Brucella species, Brucella pseudintermedia is an intracellular pathogen, meaning it can invade and replicate within the host's cells, primarily macrophages and other phagocytic cells. This ability to evade the host's immune response contributes to the persistent and chronic nature of brucellosis infections.\n\nFurther research is still needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health significance of Brucella pseudintermedia, as it remains a relatively understudied species within the Brucella genus.",
