  "description": "Brucella suis ATCC 23445 is a Gram-negative, facultatively intracellular bacterium that belongs to the genus Brucella. This strain was isolated from swine and is considered a reference strain for the species Brucella suis.\n\nBrucella suis is a zoonotic pathogen, meaning it can infect both animals and humans, causing the disease known as brucellosis. It is a small, nonspore-forming, and non-motile coccobacillus that can survive and replicate within the host's phagocytic cells, particularly macrophages.\n\nThe Brucella suis ATCC 23445 strain has been widely used in research and diagnostic applications to study the biology, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions of this important veterinary and public health concern. Understanding the characteristics and behavior of this strain contributes to the development of effective prevention and control strategies for brucellosis.",
