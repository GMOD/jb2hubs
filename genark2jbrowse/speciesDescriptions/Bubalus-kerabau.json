  "description": "Bubalus kerabau, commonly known as the Kerabau or Swamp Buffalo, is a species of domestic water buffalo found in Southeast Asia. It is a large bovine mammal characterized by its distinctive dome-shaped horns and gray-brown to black coloration.\n\nThe Kerabau is well-adapted to living in wetland environments, such as marshes, swamps, and paddy fields. It has a strong, muscular build and a thick, leathery skin that helps protect it from the sun and insects. The species is highly valued in many traditional agricultural systems, where it is used as a draft animal for plowing and transportation.\n\nKerabau are known for their gentle temperament and their ability to navigate through deep mud and water with ease. They are an important source of milk, meat, and hide for many rural communities in countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.\n\nConservation efforts are ongoing to protect the Kerabau, as their populations have declined in recent decades due to factors such as habitat loss, crossbreeding with other water buffalo breeds, and competition with mechanized farming equipment.",
