  "description": "Bundibugyo ebolavirus is a species of the Ebolavirus genus, which belongs to the Filoviridae family. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes a severe and often fatal disease known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other primates.\n\nThe Bundibugyo ebolavirus was first identified in 2007 during an outbreak in the Bundibugyo District of Uganda. It is the fifth known Ebolavirus species, after Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta√Ø Forest ebolavirus, and Reston ebolavirus.\n\nThe virus is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, and it can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces or equipment. The symptoms of Bundibugyo ebolavirus infection include fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising.\n\nBundibugyo ebolavirus is considered a significant public health concern due to its high case-fatality rate, ranging from 25% to 50% in past outbreaks. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or specific treatments for Bundibugyo ebolavirus infection, although supportive care and experimental therapies have been used to manage the disease.",
