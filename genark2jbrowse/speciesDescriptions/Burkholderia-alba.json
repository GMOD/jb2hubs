  "description": "Burkholderia alba is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Burkholderia. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Burkholderia alba was first isolated from soil samples collected in Thailand.\n\nThe cells of Burkholderia alba are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the presence of a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a wide range of pH conditions, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nBurkholderia alba is known to be capable of degrading various aromatic compounds, making it a potential candidate for bioremediation applications. It has also been reported to exhibit antifungal and plant growth-promoting activities, suggesting its potential use in agricultural and environmental applications.\n\nTaxonomically, Burkholderia alba is classified within the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of closely related and phenotypically similar Burkholderia species. The specific characteristics and potential applications of Burkholderia alba are still under ongoing research and investigation.",
