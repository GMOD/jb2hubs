  "description": "Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, motile bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. It is a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of closely related species that are opportunistic pathogens, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis or immunocompromised conditions.\n\nBurkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 is characterized by its ability to utilize a wide range of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, hence the species name \"multivorans.\" It is a non-spore-forming, oxidase-positive bacterium that can grow at temperatures ranging from 30°C to 42°C.\n\nThis strain, ATCC 17616, was originally isolated from a soil sample and is commonly used in research studies to investigate the genetic and physiological characteristics of Burkholderia multivorans, as well as its potential role in clinical and environmental settings.",
