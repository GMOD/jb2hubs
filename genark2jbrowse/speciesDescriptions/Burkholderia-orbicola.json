  "description": "Burkholderia orbicola is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Burkholderia. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Burkholderia orbicola is known to be capable of oxidizing various carbon sources, including organic acids, alcohols, and simple sugars, for its energy and growth requirements.\n\nThe cells of Burkholderia orbicola are typically rod-shaped and can form circular or irregular colonies on nutrient-rich agar media. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can tolerate a wide range of pH conditions, ranging from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nBurkholderia orbicola has been isolated from various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and the rhizosphere of plants. It is believed to play a role in the cycling of nutrients in natural ecosystems and may possess plant growth-promoting or bioremediation properties, making it a potential candidate for various biotechnological applications.",
