  "description": "Buttiauxella selenatireducens is a bacterial species known for its ability to reduce selenium oxyanions, specifically selenate, to less toxic elemental selenium. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium that belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from sediment samples collected from a selenium-contaminated environment. It is able to utilize selenate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration, converting it to insoluble elemental selenium. This property makes Buttiauxella selenatireducens a potential candidate for bioremediation applications in selenium-polluted environments.\n\nPhysiologically, Buttiauxella selenatireducens is a facultative anaerobe, capable of growing both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It can also use various organic compounds, such as glucose, lactate, and acetate, as carbon and energy sources.\n\nThe genome of Buttiauxella selenatireducens has been sequenced, providing insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying its selenate reduction capabilities. Further research on this species may contribute to the understanding of selenium biogeochemical cycling and the development of sustainable bioremediation strategies.",
