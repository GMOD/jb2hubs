  "description": "Butyricimonas faecihominis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacteria that was isolated from human fecal samples. The cells are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\nThis bacterium is classified within the Bacteroidetes phylum and belongs to the Butyricimonas genus. It is characterized by its ability to produce butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, as a major end-product of its fermentative metabolism.\n\nButyricimonas faecihominis is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota in humans and has been found to be more abundant in individuals with a healthy gut composition. Its presence has been associated with beneficial effects on host health, including the maintenance of gut homeostasis and the potential modulation of the immune system.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the specific ecological roles and functional capabilities of this bacterial species within the complex human gut microbiome.",
