  "description": "Caaingua virus is a member of the Hantavirus genus within the Bunyavirales order. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus primarily transmitted by rodents. The virus was first identified in Brazil, where it is associated with the small rodent species Necromys lasiurus, also known as the hairy-tailed bolo mouse.\n\nCaaingua virus is one of the several hantaviruses found in South America, and it can cause a severe form of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans. HCPS is characterized by fever, cough, shortness of breath, and the potential for life-threatening respiratory distress due to fluid buildup in the lungs.\n\nGenetic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that Caaingua virus is closely related to other South American hantaviruses, such as Araraquara virus and Juquitiba virus. Understanding the distribution, ecology, and transmission dynamics of Caaingua virus is important for the prevention and management of hantavirus-related diseases in affected regions.",
