  "description": "Caballeronia calidae is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a hot spring located in Yunnan Province, China. It belongs to the genus Caballeronia, which is a part of the family Burkholderiaceae within the Proteobacteria phylum.\n\nCaballeronia calidae is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium. It is characterized as a slightly curved, rod-shaped cell that measures approximately 0.3-0.6 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. The bacterium is motile, possessing a single polar flagellum.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Caballeronia calidae is closely related to other Caballeronia species, forming a distinct clade within the genus. The optimal growth temperature for this thermophilic bacterium is around 50°C, with a growth range between 40-55°C.\n\nCaballeronia calidae is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids as carbon and energy sources. It exhibits catalase and oxidase activities, and can reduce nitrate to nitrite. The bacterium is considered an environmental isolate, with no known pathogenic or industrial applications reported to date.",
