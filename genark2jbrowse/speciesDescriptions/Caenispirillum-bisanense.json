  "description": "Caenispirillum bisanense is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, and motile bacterium. The cells of C. bisanense typically measure around 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2.0-4.0 μm in length, with multiple polar flagella that provide their motility.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil collected near a thermal power plant in Bisan-gun, South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. bisanense is most closely related to other members of the genus Caenispirillum, which are commonly found in various environmental samples such as soil, sediments, and wastewater.\n\nC. bisanense is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids.\n\nThe genome of C. bisanense has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic and metabolic potential. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of its ecological roles and potential applications in environmental or biotechnological processes.",
