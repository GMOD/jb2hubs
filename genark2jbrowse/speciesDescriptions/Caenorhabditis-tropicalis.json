  "description": "Caenorhabditis tropicalis is a free-living, microscopic roundworm species belonging to the phylum Nematoda. It is a member of the Caenorhabditis genus, which is widely used as a model organism for biological research.\n\nC. tropicalis is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often associated with rotting plant material or decaying organic matter. Like other Caenorhabditis species, it has a simple body plan consisting of a cylindrical, unsegmented body with a distinct head and tail.\n\nThe species is hermaphroditic, meaning each individual can produce both male and female gametes. C. tropicalis has a short life cycle, with a generation time of around 3-4 days at optimal temperatures. It feeds primarily on bacteria and other microorganisms present in its environment.\n\nGenetically, C. tropicalis is closely related to the well-studied model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, but it exhibits some distinct morphological and behavioral characteristics. Researchers have utilized C. tropicalis as a comparative model to study the evolution and developmental biology of nematodes, as well as to investigate host-microbe interactions and stress responses.",
