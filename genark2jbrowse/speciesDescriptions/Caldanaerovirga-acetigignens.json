  "description": "Caldanaerovirga acetigignens is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, and acetogenic bacteria. It was isolated from a hot spring sediment sample collected in Yellowstone National Park, United States.\n\nThe cells of Caldanaerovirga acetigignens are rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and motile with peritrichous flagella. They grow optimally at a temperature of around 65Â°C and a pH between 6.0 and 7.0.\n\nCaldanaerovirga acetigignens is capable of heterotrophic growth, utilizing a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and cellobiose, as carbon and energy sources. During growth, it produces acetate as the primary fermentation end-product.\n\nPhylogenetically, Caldanaerovirga acetigignens belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and is closely related to other thermophilic, acetogenic bacteria within the order Clostridiales.\n\nThe genome of Caldanaerovirga acetigignens has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the high-temperature environment from which it was isolated.",
