  "description": "Caldicoprobacter faecalis is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from human fecal samples. It belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridiaceae family.\n\nThe cells of C. faecalis are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. They are capable of forming endospores, which allows the bacteria to survive in harsh environmental conditions.\n\nCaldicoprobacter faecalis is a chemoorganotrophic microorganism, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It can ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, producing acetate, lactate, and hydrogen as the main fermentation products.\n\nThis species is considered thermophilic, as it can grow optimally at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 65°C, with a maximum growth temperature of around 70°C. It is also acidophilic, growing best at pH values between 5.5 and 7.0.\n\nCaldicoprobacter faecalis has been found to be a member of the human gut microbiome, and its presence may have potential implications for human health and disease, although its specific roles and interactions within the gut ecosystem are still under investigation.",
