  "description": "Calliphora vicina, commonly known as the common blue bottle fly or the European blow fly, is a species of blowfly found throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the family Calliphoridae, a group of flies that are often associated with the decomposition of organic matter.\n\nThe adult C. vicina is a medium-sized fly, typically measuring between 8-14 millimeters in length. It has a metallic blue or green-colored thorax and abdomen, with black legs and antennae. The fly's compound eyes are large and prominent, and its mouthparts are adapted for feeding on a variety of decaying organic materials, including carrion, feces, and rotting plant matter.\n\nC. vicina is an important species in forensic entomology, as the presence and development stages of its larvae (maggots) can be used to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations. The larvae are typically cream-colored, with a tapered body and two posterior spiracles (respiratory openings). They undergo three distinct larval stages (instars) before pupating and emerging as adult flies.\n\nThe life cycle of C. vicina is closely tied to environmental conditions, with the duration of each stage influenced by factors such as temperature and humidity. This species is known for its rapid colonization of decomposing remains, making it a valuable indicator of postmortem interval in forensic investigations.",
