  "description": "Callorhinchus milii, commonly known as the Australian ghost shark or the elephant fish, is a species of cartilaginous fish belonging to the order Chimaeriformes. This unique marine creature is found in the coastal waters of southern Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Australian ghost shark is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of around 60-80 cm. It has a distinctive, elongated snout that resembles an elephant's trunk, giving it a unique and somewhat ghostly appearance. The body is typically gray or brown in color, with a smooth, scaleless skin.\n\nOne of the most notable features of the Australian ghost shark is its specialized feeding mechanism. It uses its elongated snout to probe the seafloor, searching for small crustaceans, mollusks, and other benthic prey. The fish's jaws are equipped with plate-like teeth, which it uses to crush the shells of its prey.\n\nCallorhinchus milii is an ovoviviparous species, meaning that the eggs hatch within the female's body, and the young are then born live. This reproductive strategy allows the offspring to receive additional protection and nourishment during their early stages of development.\n\nThe Australian ghost shark is not considered a threat to humans and is generally not targeted by commercial fisheries. However, it is of interest to marine biologists and researchers due to its unique evolutionary adaptations and its role in the coastal ecosystems of southern Australia and New Zealand.",
