  "description": "Callorhinus ursinus, commonly known as the northern fur seal, is a species of pinniped found in the North Pacific Ocean. It is a member of the family Otariidae, which includes sea lions and fur seals.\n\nThe northern fur seal is a medium-sized marine mammal, with adult males typically weighing between 400-600 kg and adult females weighing between 100-160 kg. They have a thick, dense fur coat that provides insulation and protection from the cold, aquatic environment in which they live.\n\nNorthern fur seals are known for their migratory behavior, with breeding colonies located on remote islands in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. They spend much of their time at sea, foraging for a variety of fish, squid, and crustaceans. During the breeding season, they gather in large colonies on land, where they engage in complex social behaviors and reproductive activities.\n\nThe species is considered to be of \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List, although some populations have experienced declines due to factors such as overhunting, bycatch in fisheries, and environmental changes. Conservation efforts, including management of hunting and fisheries interactions, have helped to stabilize the population in recent years.",
