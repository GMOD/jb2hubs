  "description": "Calonectris borealis, commonly known as the Cory's shearwater, is a seabird species belonging to the family Procellariidae. It is a medium-sized shearwater with a distinctive appearance and behavior.\n\nDescription:\nCory's shearwater is a large shearwater, with a wingspan of approximately 110-125 cm and a body length of 40-45 cm. It has a robust, streamlined body and a large, hooked bill. The plumage is predominantly brown or grayish-brown on the upper parts, with a paler, grayish-white underside. The bird has a distinctive dark cap and a pale face, which helps distinguish it from other shearwater species.\n\nHabitat and Distribution:\nCory's shearwater is a pelagic species, meaning it spends most of its life at sea, far from land. It breeds on islands and coastal areas in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, primarily in the Macaronesian archipelagos (Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands, and Cape Verde). During the non-breeding season, it can be found throughout the Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the northeastern coast of North America to the western coast of Africa.\n\nBehavior and Ecology:\nCory's shearwater is a highly migratory species, undertaking long-distance movements between its breeding and non-breeding grounds. It is an excellent flyer, adept at soaring and gliding over the ocean surface. The species is primarily nocturnal, returning to its breeding colonies at night to avoid predators. Cory's shearwater feeds mainly on small fish, squid, and crustaceans, which it catches by diving and surface-seizing.\n\nConservation Status:\nCory's shearwater is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, the species faces various threats, including habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and the impact of commercial fisheries. Conservation efforts focus on the protection of breeding colonies and the mitigation of these threats to ensure the long-term survival of Cory's shearwater.",
