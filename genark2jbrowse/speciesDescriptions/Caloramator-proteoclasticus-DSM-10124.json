  "description": "Caloramator proteoclasticus DSM 10124 is an anaerobic, thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. It was isolated from a thermal spring in New Zealand.\n\nSome key features of this species:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 2-6 μm long. They form endospores.\n\n2. Physiology: C. proteoclasticus is a chemoorganotroph, capable of utilizing a variety of proteinaceous substrates as energy and carbon sources. It can grow optimally at temperatures around 60°C and at a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\n3. Metabolism: It is a strictly anaerobic bacterium, capable of fermentative growth. It can degrade proteins and peptides, producing acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the main fermentation end-products.\n\n4. Taxonomy: C. proteoclasticus was originally classified as Clostridium proteoclasticum, but was later reclassified into the genus Caloramator based on phylogenetic analysis and distinct physiological characteristics.\n\n5. Significance: This thermophilic, proteolytic bacterium is of interest due to its potential applications in bioremediation, biofuel production, and the breakdown of recalcitrant organic matter in high-temperature environments.",
