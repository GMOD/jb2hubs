  "description": "Caloramator quimbayensis is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from a hot spring located in the Quimbaya region of Colombia, South America. It belongs to the genus Caloramator, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nThis bacterium is rod-shaped, with a cell size ranging from 2.5-5.0 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. It is capable of growing at temperatures between 45-70°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 60°C. Caloramator quimbayensis can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and xylose, as carbon and energy sources, and it can produce acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the main fermentation end-products.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison has shown that Caloramator quimbayensis is closely related to other thermophilic Caloramator species, such as Caloramator fervidus and Caloramator australicus, which are also found in high-temperature environments. The genome of Caloramator quimbayensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to its thermal habitat.",
