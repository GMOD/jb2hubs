  "description": "Campylobacter majalis is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Campylobacter. It is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, and microaerophilic bacterium. Campylobacter majalis was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of wild birds, particularly waterfowl, in Europe. This species is known to be found in the natural environment, including soil and water sources, and has been associated with sporadic cases of gastroenteritis in humans, although its pathogenicity and public health significance are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the ecology, epidemiology, and potential clinical implications of Campylobacter majalis.",
