  "description": "Canariomyces notabilis is a species of fungus belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a member of the order Cantharellales and the family Cantharellaceae.\n\nCanariomyces notabilis is a basidiomycete fungus that is found in the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago located off the northwestern coast of Africa. It is known to form ectomycorrhizal associations with various tree species, including pine trees (Pinus spp.).\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Canariomyces notabilis are typically small, ranging from 2 to 6 centimeters in diameter. They have a convex to funnel-shaped cap with a smooth, yellowish-brown to reddish-brown surface. The stem is short, thick, and often has a whitish or pale yellow color.\n\nMicroscopically, the fungus is characterized by its spore-bearing structures, known as basidia, which produce basidiospores. The basidiospores are smooth, elliptical, and typically measure between 7 to 10 micrometers in length.\n\nCanariomyces notabilis is considered a rare and interesting species within the Cantharellaceae family, and its distribution is primarily limited to the Canary Islands, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a mycorrhizal symbiont.",
