  "description": "Candida albicans SC5314 is a well-studied strain of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, which is a common commensal organism found in the human gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a range of infections, from mild mucosal infections to life-threatening systemic candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe SC5314 strain is widely used in research as a model organism for understanding the biology, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions of C. albicans. This strain was originally isolated from a patient with systemic candidiasis and has been extensively characterized at the genetic and genomic level.\n\nSome key features of Candida albicans SC5314 include:\n\n1. Genome: The SC5314 strain has a diploid genome of approximately 14.3 million base pairs, with a high degree of genetic diversity and plasticity.\n\n2. Morphology: C. albicans is a polymorphic fungus, capable of adopting different morphological forms, including yeast, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae, which are important for its virulence and adaptability.\n\n3. Virulence factors: The SC5314 strain expresses a variety of virulence factors, such as adhesins, secreted hydrolytic enzymes, and the ability to form biofilms, which contribute to its pathogenicity.\n\n4. Antifungal resistance: Candida albicans, including the SC5314 strain, has developed resistance to various antifungal drugs, posing a significant challenge in the treatment of candidiasis.\n\nOverall, Candida albicans SC5314 is a widely used and well-characterized model organism that has significantly advanced our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of this important human fungal pathogen.",
