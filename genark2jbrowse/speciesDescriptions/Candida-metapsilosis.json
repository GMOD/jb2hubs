  "description": "Candida metapsilosis is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Candida. It is a member of the Candida parapsilosis species complex, which also includes Candida parapsilosis and Candida orthopsilosis.\n\nCandida metapsilosis is a diploid, asexual, and dimorphic fungus that can exist in both yeast and hyphal forms. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause various types of candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nMorphologically, Candida metapsilosis colonies appear smooth, creamy, and pasty on growth media. The cells are oval-shaped and reproduce by budding. Biochemically, the species can assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources, and it exhibits resistance to certain antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole.\n\nGenetically, Candida metapsilosis can be distinguished from other Candida species within the parapsilosis complex through molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.\n\nThe epidemiology and clinical significance of Candida metapsilosis are still being investigated, as it is a relatively newly described species. Further research is needed to understand its pathogenicity, virulence factors, and potential role in human infections.",
