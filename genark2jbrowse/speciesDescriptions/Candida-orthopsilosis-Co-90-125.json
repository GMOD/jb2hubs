  "description": "Candida orthopsilosis Co 90-125 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Candida. It is a member of the Candida parapsilosis species complex, which includes three closely related species: Candida parapsilosis, Candida metapsilosis, and Candida orthopsilosis.\n\nCandida orthopsilosis Co 90-125 is a diploid, asexual, and unicellular fungal organism. It reproduces through budding, a process in which a new cell (bud) is formed from the parent cell. The cells are typically oval or ellipsoidal in shape and range in size from 3 to 6 micrometers in diameter.\n\nThis species is commonly found as a commensal organism on the skin and mucosal surfaces of humans and other warm-blooded animals. However, it can also be an opportunistic pathogen and cause various types of candidiasis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nCandida orthopsilosis Co 90-125 is closely related to the more well-known Candida parapsilosis species, and they share many phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing, are often used to distinguish between these closely related species.\n\nResearch on Candida orthopsilosis Co 90-125 is ongoing, as scientists continue to investigate its epidemiology, virulence factors, and clinical significance in the context of human and animal health.",
