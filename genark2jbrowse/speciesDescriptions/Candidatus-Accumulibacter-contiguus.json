  "description": "Candidatus Accumulibacter contiguus is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a member of the Accumulibacter genus, which is known for its ability to accumulate large amounts of polyphosphate within its cells.\n\nCandidatus Accumulibacter contiguus is an aerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium. It is typically found in wastewater treatment plants, where it plays a crucial role in the biological removal of phosphorus from the wastewater.\n\nThe unique characteristic of Candidatus Accumulibacter contiguus is its ability to accumulate polyphosphate, which is a polymer of orthophosphate. This ability allows the bacterium to remove phosphorus from the wastewater and store it within its cells, preventing it from being discharged into the environment and potentially causing eutrophication.\n\nCandidatus Accumulibacter contiguus is considered a key player in the phosphorus removal process in wastewater treatment, and its presence and abundance are often monitored and studied to optimize the efficiency of phosphorus removal in these systems.",
