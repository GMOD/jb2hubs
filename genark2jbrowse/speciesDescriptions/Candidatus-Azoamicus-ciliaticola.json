  "description": "Candidatus Azoamicus ciliaticola is a recently discovered bacterial species that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It was first identified and named in 2020 based on genomic analysis of samples collected from a ciliate protozoan host.\n\nThis bacterium is considered an obligate intracellular symbiont, meaning it can only thrive and reproduce within the cells of its ciliate host. The name \"ciliaticola\" refers to its close association with ciliates, a group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms characterized by the presence of hair-like structures called cilia, which they use for locomotion and feeding.\n\nCandidatus Azoamicus ciliaticola is believed to play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle within the ciliate host's environment. It is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into a usable form for the host, in exchange for other nutrients or metabolites provided by the ciliate.\n\nThe genome of Candidatus Azoamicus ciliaticola is relatively small, consistent with its specialized, symbiotic lifestyle. It lacks many biosynthetic pathways found in free-living bacteria, indicating a high degree of metabolic interdependence with its ciliate host.\n\nThis species has not yet been successfully cultured in the laboratory, as is common for many obligate intracellular symbionts. Its identification and characterization have relied primarily on metagenomics and other molecular techniques applied to environmental samples containing the ciliate host.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance and potential applications of this newly discovered bacterial symbiont.",
