  "description": "Candidatus Doolittlea endobia is a bacterial species that lives as an endosymbiont within the cells of certain insect species. It is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and is considered a \"Candidatus\" species, meaning it has not yet been formally described and classified.\n\nCandidatus Doolittlea endobia is found within the cytoplasm of host cells, where it provides essential nutrients and metabolic functions to its insect host. As an endosymbiont, it has a reduced genome compared to free-living bacteria, as it relies on the host cell for many basic cellular processes.\n\nThe specific role and interactions of Candidatus Doolittlea endobia within its insect host are still being studied, but it is believed to play a crucial role in the host's physiology, development, and overall fitness. Understanding the ecology and evolution of this endosymbiotic relationship can provide insights into the complex and interdependent relationships between microbes and their multicellular hosts.",
