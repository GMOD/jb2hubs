  "description": "Candidatus Endowatersipora endosymbiont of Watersipora subatra is a bacterial endosymbiont species that resides within the marine bryozoan Watersipora subatra. Bryozoans are small, aquatic invertebrate animals that form colonies, and Watersipora subatra is a species of bryozoan found in marine environments.\n\nThe Candidatus Endowatersipora endosymbiont is a member of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and is believed to have a mutualistic relationship with its bryozoan host. As an endosymbiont, the bacterial species lives within the cells of the Watersipora subatra bryozoan, likely providing some beneficial functions or metabolic capabilities to its host.\n\nThe exact nature of the symbiosis between the Candidatus Endowatersipora endosymbiont and Watersipora subatra is not yet fully understood, but studies suggest it may play a role in the bryozoan's growth, development, or adaptation to its environment. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and implications of this endosymbiotic relationship.",
