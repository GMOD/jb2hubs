  "description": "Candidatus Methylocalor cossyra is a recently discovered, uncultivated species of methanotrophic bacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are a group of prokaryotes that are able to use methane as their sole carbon and energy source.\n\nCandidatus Methylocalor cossyra was first identified through DNA sequencing and genomic analysis from environmental samples collected in the sediments of a coastal marine environment near the island of Pantelleria, Italy. The name \"Methylocalor cossyra\" refers to the genus Methylocalor, which indicates its ability to oxidize methane, and the species name \"cossyra\" refers to the geographical location where it was discovered.\n\nGenomic analysis suggests that Candidatus Methylocalor cossyra is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria and is closely related to other known methanotrophic bacteria. It appears to possess the necessary genetic machinery to utilize methane as its primary carbon and energy source, including the key enzyme methane monooxygenase. However, due to the fact that it has not been successfully cultured in a laboratory setting, many of its specific physiological and metabolic characteristics remain to be fully elucidated.\n\nThe discovery of Candidatus Methylocalor cossyra and other uncultivated methanotrophic bacteria highlights the importance of environmental genomics in expanding our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of microorganisms in natural ecosystems, particularly in relation to the global methane cycle.",
