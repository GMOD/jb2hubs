  "description": "Candidatus Nitrospira neomarina is a recently discovered, uncultivated species of bacteria belonging to the phylum Nitrospirae. It was first identified through metagenomic analysis of seawater samples collected from the North Pacific Ocean.\n\nCandidatus Nitrospira neomarina is a chemolithoautotrophic organism, meaning it obtains its energy through the oxidation of inorganic compounds, in this case, nitrite (NO2−), and it can fix carbon dioxide to produce organic compounds for its own growth and metabolism.\n\nThis species is believed to play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle in marine environments, specifically in the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate (NO3−), a process known as nitrite oxidation. By carrying out this step in the nitrification process, Candidatus Nitrospira neomarina contributes to the removal of nitrite and the production of nitrate, which can then be utilized by other organisms in the ecosystem.\n\nDue to its uncultivated status, the precise physiological and metabolic characteristics of Candidatus Nitrospira neomarina are not yet fully understood. However, its identification and potential significance in the marine nitrogen cycle highlight the importance of continued exploration and study of microbial diversity in natural environments.",
