  "description": "Candidatus Nitrotoga arctica is a chemolithoautotrophic, nitrite-oxidizing bacterium that was first discovered in the Arctic region. It belongs to the phylum Nitrospirae, which comprises a group of bacteria known for their ability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate, a key step in the nitrogen cycle.\n\nCandidatus Nitrotoga arctica is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) organism, adapted to thrive in the low-temperature environments of the Arctic. It is considered a member of the so-called \"Candidatus\" taxa, which are microorganisms that have not been successfully isolated and cultured in a laboratory setting, and therefore have not been formally described and named according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.\n\nThis bacterium is believed to play a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle in Arctic ecosystems, where it contributes to the conversion of nitrite to nitrate, making it available for other organisms. Its discovery has expanded our understanding of the microbial diversity and functional roles within the unique and challenging environments of the Arctic region.",
