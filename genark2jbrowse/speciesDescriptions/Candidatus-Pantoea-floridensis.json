  "description": "Candidatus Pantoea floridensis is a bacterial species that was recently discovered and identified in Florida, United States. It is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. The species belongs to the genus Pantoea, which is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family.\n\nCandidatus Pantoea floridensis was first isolated from environmental samples collected in the Florida Everglades region. Genome analysis has revealed that it has a circular chromosome and several plasmids, which contribute to its genetic diversity and potential adaptability to various environmental conditions.\n\nThe species is currently considered a candidate (Candidatus) species, as its isolation and characterization are still ongoing, and it has not yet been formally described and validated according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. Further research is needed to fully understand its ecological roles, metabolic capabilities, and potential interactions with other organisms in its natural habitat.",
