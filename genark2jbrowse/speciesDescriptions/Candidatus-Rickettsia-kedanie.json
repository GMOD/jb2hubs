  "description": "Candidatus Rickettsia kageris is a proposed species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Rickettsia. Rickettsia are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria known to be the causative agents of several important human diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus.\n\nCandidatus Rickettsia kageris was first detected in ticks of the species Haemaphysalis flava collected from small mammals in Japan. The name \"kageris\" refers to the Japanese word for the tick species in which it was found.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene and other genetic markers suggests that Candidatus Rickettsia kageris is distinct from other known Rickettsia species and represents a potentially new species within the genus. However, the bacterium has not yet been formally named and described in the scientific literature, hence the designation \"Candidatus.\"\n\nFurther research is needed to fully characterize the biology, ecology, and potential pathogenicity of Candidatus Rickettsia kageris. As an intracellular bacterium, it likely shares some similarities with other Rickettsia species in terms of its life cycle and interactions with host cells, but its specific traits and potential impact on human or animal health remain to be determined.",
