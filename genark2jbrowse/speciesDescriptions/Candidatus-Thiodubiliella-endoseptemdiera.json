  "description": "Candidatus Thiodubiliella endoseptemdiera is a recently discovered, uncultured bacterial species that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a chemolithoautotrophic organism, meaning it obtains its energy through the oxidation of inorganic compounds, specifically sulfur compounds, and uses carbon dioxide as its carbon source for growth.\n\nThis species is considered an endosymbiont, as it is found living within the cells of a marine oligochaete worm, specifically within the septum (dividing wall) between its segments. The name \"endoseptemdiera\" refers to this unique intracellular lifestyle, where the bacteria reside within the septum of the host organism.\n\nCandidatus Thiodubiliella endoseptemdiera is believed to play a role in the sulfur cycle, as it is capable of oxidizing sulfur compounds to obtain energy. This process may provide both the host worm and the bacterial symbiont with nutritional benefits.\n\nDue to its uncultured nature, the detailed physiological and genomic characteristics of this species are not yet fully understood. However, its discovery and identification have expanded our knowledge of the diversity and ecological importance of microbial symbioses in marine environments.",
