  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia is a proposed species of uncultured, intracellular bacterial endosymbiont found within the beetle Dascillus cervinus, also known as the brown chafer.\n\nThis endosymbiont belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is believed to be a member of the class Flavobacteriia. It resides within the cells of the host beetle, forming a symbiotic relationship.\n\nThe presence of Candidatus Tisiphia has been detected through molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, but its precise function and the nature of its interaction with the host are not yet fully understood. \n\nEndosymbionts like Candidatus Tisiphia are commonly found in various insect species and can play important roles in their host's physiology, nutrition, or defense against pathogens. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific role and significance of this endosymbiont within the Dascillus cervinus beetle.",
