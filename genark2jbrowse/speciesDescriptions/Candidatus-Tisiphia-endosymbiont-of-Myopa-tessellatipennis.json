  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia is a genus of bacteria that has been identified as an endosymbiont, meaning it lives in a symbiotic relationship, within the insect species Myopa tessellatipennis. Endosymbionts are microorganisms that reside inside the cells of their host organisms, often providing some benefit to the host in exchange for nutrients or a stable living environment.\n\nCandidatus Tisiphia is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes, which are known for their metabolic versatility and diverse roles in host-associated microbiomes. As an endosymbiont of M. tessellatipennis, Candidatus Tisiphia likely plays a crucial role in the physiology, development, or ecology of its host insect species. However, the specific nature of this symbiotic relationship and the potential functional contributions of Candidatus Tisiphia to its host are not yet fully understood and require further scientific investigation.",
