  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont of Sialis lutaria is a bacterial endosymbiont that resides within the aquatic insect species Sialis lutaria, commonly known as the alder fly or alderfly. This endosymbiont is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria and is considered a candidate species, meaning its classification is provisional due to the lack of a cultured, isolated, and fully characterized specimen.\n\nThe Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont is found within the cells of the alderfly, where it maintains a symbiotic relationship with its host. As an endosymbiont, Candidatus Tisiphia likely provides some beneficial function to the alderfly, such as aiding in nutrient acquisition, metabolic processes, or defense against pathogens. However, the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is not yet fully understood.\n\nDue to the challenges associated with culturing and studying uncultivated bacterial species, the genome and cellular characteristics of Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont have not been extensively documented. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific role and evolutionary history of this endosymbiont within the alderfly's biology and ecology.",
