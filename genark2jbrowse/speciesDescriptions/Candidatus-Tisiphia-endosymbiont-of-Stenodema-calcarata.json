  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia is a proposed species of uncultured, obligate intracellular bacteria that lives as an endosymbiont within the body of the insect Stenodema calcarata, commonly known as the bordered plant bug.\n\nThis bacterium is classified as a \"Candidatus\" species, which means it has not been formally described and named according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria, as it has not been isolated and cultivated in a laboratory setting.\n\nThe Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont resides within the cells of the host insect, Stenodema calcarata, and is believed to play a crucial role in the biology and physiology of its host. Endosymbiotic relationships, such as this one, are common in many insects and can provide the host with essential nutrients, protection against pathogens, or other beneficial functions.\n\nThe exact nature of the symbiotic relationship between Candidatus Tisiphia and Stenodema calcarata is not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms and potential benefits of this association.",
