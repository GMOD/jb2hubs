  "description": "Candidatus Uabimicrobium helgolandensis is a recently discovered, uncultivated bacterial species that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first identified and named based on genomic data obtained from environmental samples collected in the North Sea near the island of Helgoland, Germany.\n\nThe species name \"helgolandensis\" refers to the geographic location where it was initially detected. Candidatus Uabimicrobium is a provisional taxonomic designation, as the bacterium has not yet been successfully isolated and cultured in a laboratory setting.\n\nBased on genomic analysis, Candidatus Uabimicrobium helgolandensis is believed to be a heterotrophic, marine bacterium that likely plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in its natural environment. Further research is needed to fully understand its physiology, ecological function, and potential biotechnological applications.",
