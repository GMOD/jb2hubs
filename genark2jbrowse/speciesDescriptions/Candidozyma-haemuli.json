  "description": "Candidozyma haemuli is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It was first isolated from the intestine of a marine mollusc, the dog whelk (Nucella lapillus), collected from the coast of South Korea.\n\nThe key characteristics of Candidozyma haemuli are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are round to oval in shape, measuring 2-4 Î¼m in diameter.\n\n2. Reproduction: Candidozyma haemuli reproduces asexually through budding, a common mode of reproduction in yeasts.\n\n3. Colony appearance: The colonies formed by this yeast on agar media are white to cream-colored, smooth, and glistening.\n\n4. Physiology: This yeast is able to assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and galactose. It can grow in the presence of 10% sodium chloride.\n\n5. Habitat and ecology: Candidozyma haemuli is found in the intestinal tract of marine molluscs, suggesting it may have a symbiotic or commensal relationship with its host.\n\nOverall, Candidozyma haemuli is a marine-adapted yeast species that has been isolated from the gut of a common coastal mollusk. Further research is needed to understand its ecological role and potential biotechnological applications.",
