  "description": "Canine vesivirus is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Vesivirus within the family Caliciviridae. This virus primarily infects dogs and is known to cause a range of clinical symptoms, including fever, letharary, and oral lesions.\n\nThe viral genome of Canine vesivirus is approximately 8.2 to 8.5 kilobases in length and encodes several proteins, including the major capsid protein, which is responsible for the structural integrity of the viral particle. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, and it can survive in the environment for extended periods.\n\nCanine vesivirus is considered an emerging pathogen in the veterinary field, and its prevalence and clinical significance are still being actively investigated. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of this virus is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and preventive strategies to manage the disease in canine populations.",
