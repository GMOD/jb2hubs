  "description": "Capira virus is a newly discovered RNA virus that belongs to the family Phasmaviridae. It was first isolated from ticks collected in the Capira region of Panama in 2019. The virus has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome that encodes several structural and non-structural proteins.\n\nCapira virus is believed to be transmitted by ticks and has been found to infect various small mammal species, including rodents, in its natural habitat. The virus has not yet been associated with any specific human disease, but further research is ongoing to understand its potential public health implications.\n\nGenetically, Capira virus is most closely related to other tick-borne phasmaviruses, but it represents a distinct species within the Phasmaviridae family. Ongoing studies are focused on understanding the virus's ecology, host range, and potential for cross-species transmission.",
