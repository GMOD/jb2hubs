  "description": "Capnocytophaga canis is a species of bacteria that is commonly found in the oral microbiome of dogs. It is a gram-negative, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nCapnocytophaga canis is a member of the Capnocytophaga genus, which are known to be part of the normal oral flora in both humans and animals. The species C. canis is specifically associated with the canine oral cavity and can occasionally be transmitted from dogs to humans, causing opportunistic infections in individuals with compromised immune systems.\n\nThis bacterium is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it can occasionally cause infections in humans, such as cellulitis, septicemia, and meningitis, particularly in individuals with underlying medical conditions or those who have experienced dog bites or scratches. However, in most cases, C. canis is a harmless commensal organism in dogs and does not typically cause disease in the canine host.\n\nOverall, Capnocytophaga canis is an important component of the canine oral microbiome, and its potential pathogenicity in humans highlights the importance of proper hygiene and caution when interacting with dogs, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems.",
