  "description": "Capra aegagrus, commonly known as the wild goat or the bezoar ibex, is a species of wild goat that is native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. This species is the ancestor of the domestic goat (Capra hircus) and is considered a key species in the evolution of domestic livestock.\n\nCapra aegagrus is a medium-sized ungulate that typically stands between 75 to 110 cm tall at the shoulder. They have a stocky build with short, curved horns that can reach up to 120 cm in length, and their coat is typically a reddish-brown color that turns darker during the winter months.\n\nThese animals are well-adapted to their mountainous habitat, with strong hooves and agile movements that allow them to navigate steep, rocky terrain with ease. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, and shrubs found in their native habitat.\n\nCapra aegagrus is known for its impressive social structure, with males forming hierarchical groups and engaging in ritualized displays and battles to establish dominance. Females, on the other hand, form smaller groups and are responsible for raising the young.\n\nDue to habitat loss, overhunting, and competition with domestic livestock, Capra aegagrus is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts are underway to protect this important species and its native habitat.",
