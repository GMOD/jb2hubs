  "description": "Capra hircus, commonly known as the domestic goat, is a hoofed mammal species that belongs to the Bovidae family. It is one of the earliest domesticated animals, with evidence of goat domestication dating back to around 10,000 years ago.\n\nCapra hircus is a medium-sized ruminant animal, typically standing between 60 to 120 centimeters tall at the shoulder. They have a robust, muscular build with cloven hooves and horns that are usually curved or spiral-shaped. The coat of the domestic goat can vary in color, including white, black, brown, gray, and various combinations of these colors.\n\nGoats are known for their adaptability and can thrive in a wide range of environments, from temperate to arid regions. They are browsers, meaning they prefer to feed on a variety of plant matter, including shrubs, bushes, and grasses.\n\nCapra hircus is an important livestock species, providing meat, milk, fiber, and other products for human use. Goats are also valued for their ability to thrive in marginal environments and their role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems.",
