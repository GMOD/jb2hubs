It can also be found as an introduced species in other parts of the world.\n\n6. Ecological Significance: Capsella rubella serves as a food source for various insect species, particularly some butterfly and moth larvae. It is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings.\n\nThis brief description highlights the key morphological and ecological characteristics of Capsella rubella, a common and widely distributed plant species within the Brassicaceae family.",
