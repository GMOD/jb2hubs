  "description": "Carassius auratus, commonly known as the goldfish, is a freshwater fish species that belongs to the family Cyprinidae. It is one of the most popular and widely-kept aquarium and pond fish species in the world.\n\nThe goldfish is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths between 10-30 cm, depending on the variety. It has a rounded, streamlined body shape and a single, forked tail fin. Goldfish are known for their vibrant, golden-orange coloration, although various color morphs, such as white, black, and calico, have been selectively bred over time.\n\nCarassius auratus is native to East Asia, with its natural range extending from northeastern China to Japan. However, the species has been widely introduced and cultivated around the world, making it a globally-distributed species.\n\nGoldfish are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including algae, plants, and small invertebrates. They are known for their adaptability and can thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, from small home aquariums to large outdoor ponds.\n\nCarassius auratus is a popular choice for hobbyists and aquarium enthusiasts due to its hardy nature, vibrant colors, and relatively low maintenance requirements. The species has also been the subject of extensive research in fields such as genetics, behavior, and ecology, contributing to our understanding of vertebrate biology and evolution.",
