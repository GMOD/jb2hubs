  "description": "Cardinium is a genus of Bacteroidetes bacteria that can act as endosymbionts, living within the cells of various arthropod species. The Cardinium endosymbiont of Nabis limbatus is a specific strain of this bacteria that resides within the cells of the insect species Nabis limbatus, also known as the bordered plant bug.\n\nNabis limbatus is a predatory true bug that feeds on other insects and arthropods. The Cardinium endosymbiont has been found to manipulate the reproduction of its N. limbatus host, inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility. This means that when an uninfected female mates with an infected male, the offspring will not survive, giving the Cardinium-infected individuals a reproductive advantage.\n\nThe Cardinium endosymbiont of N. limbatus is vertically transmitted, passed from infected females to their offspring, allowing it to persist within the host population. This symbiotic relationship between the bacterium and its insect host is an example of how endosymbionts can influence the biology and ecology of their arthropod partners.",
