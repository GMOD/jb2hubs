  "description": "Cardinium is a genus of obligate intracellular bacteria that are known to be endosymbionts, meaning they live within the cells of their host organisms. The Cardinium endosymbiont of Tipula unca is a specific strain or type of Cardinium that is found within the cells of the crane fly species Tipula unca.\n\nTipula unca is a species of crane fly, which are a type of true fly in the order Diptera. The Cardinium endosymbiont is believed to reside within the cells of Tipula unca, likely playing a role in the host's biology, reproduction, or other aspects of its life cycle.\n\nCardinium endosymbionts are known to exhibit a range of interactions with their host organisms, from beneficial mutualistic relationships to reproductive manipulations. The specific nature of the relationship between the Cardinium endosymbiont and Tipula unca is an area of ongoing research and investigation by scientists studying this host-symbiont system.",
