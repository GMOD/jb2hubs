  "description": "Cardiobacterium hominis is a species of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria that belongs to the family Cardiobacteriaceae. It is a member of the normal human microbiota and can be found in the upper respiratory tract, particularly in the oral cavity and nasopharynx.\n\nC. hominis is a slow-growing, non-spore-forming, coccobacillary or short rod-shaped bacterium. It is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive, and its optimal growth temperature is around 37Â°C (human body temperature).\n\nThis species is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with rare cases of infective endocarditis, a serious infection of the heart valves or lining. However, its role as a causative agent of disease is not well-established, and it is more commonly found as a commensal organism in healthy individuals.\n\nGenetically, C. hominis has a small circular chromosome and is closely related to other members of the Cardiobacteriaceae family, such as Suttonella and Cardiobacterium valvarum. Its genome sequence has been determined, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential virulence factors.\n\nOverall, Cardiobacterium hominis is a relatively understudied member of the human microbiome, and further research is needed to fully understand its ecology, interactions with the host, and potential clinical significance.",
