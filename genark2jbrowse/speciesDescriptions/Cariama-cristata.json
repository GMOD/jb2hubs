It belongs to the order Cariamiformes and the family Cariamidae.\n\nThe red-legged seriema is characterized by its distinctive long, thin legs, which are reddish in color, and a prominent crest on its head. The body plumage is predominantly gray-brown, with black-and-white barring on the wings and tail. These birds are known for their loud, distinctive calls, which are often described as a high-pitched, wailing \"kree-kree-kree\" sound.\n\nRed-legged seriemas are primarily ground-dwelling birds, foraging for a variety of small vertebrates, insects, and plant matter. They are known for their agility and ability to run swiftly, often using their strong beaks to strike and kill their prey.\n\nThese birds are found in a range of habitats, including open savannas, grasslands, and scrublands, where they play a significant role in the ecosystem as predators and scavengers. The red-legged seriema is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with stable populations throughout its native range.",
