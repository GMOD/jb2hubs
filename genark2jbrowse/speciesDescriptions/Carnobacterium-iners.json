  "description": "Carnobacterium iners is a species of lactic acid bacteria that belongs to the genus Carnobacterium. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nCarnobacterium iners is typically isolated from various environments, including fermented foods, dairy products, and the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It is known for its ability to produce lactic acid as a byproduct of its metabolic processes.\n\nThe cells of Carnobacterium iners are typically rod-shaped and can arrange in pairs or short chains. They are catalase-negative and oxidase-variable, which are characteristic features of lactic acid bacteria.\n\nThis species is considered to be psychrotrophic, meaning it can grow at low temperatures, often found in refrigerated or chilled environments. Carnobacterium iners is also known to be tolerant to various environmental stresses, such as low pH and high salt concentrations.\n\nDue to its presence in food and animal-associated habitats, Carnobacterium iners has been the subject of research regarding its potential roles in food preservation, probiotic applications, and its interactions with other microorganisms in various ecosystems.",
