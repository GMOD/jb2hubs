  "description": "Catenulispora yoronensis is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil collected in Yoron Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. \n\nCells of C. yoronensis are coccoid to short rod-shaped, and they form chains or aggregates. The optimum growth temperature is around 30Â°C, and the optimum pH is between 6.0 and 7.0. \n\nChemotaxonomic analysis of C. yoronensis revealed that the cell wall peptidoglycan contains meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid. The major menaquinone is MK-9(H4), and the major cellular fatty acids are iso-C16:0 and anteiso-C17:0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicates that C. yoronensis belongs to the genus Catenulispora within the family Catenulisporaceae. It is most closely related to other Catenulispora species, such as C. acidiphila and C. rubra.\n\nThe isolation and description of C. yoronensis contribute to the understanding of the taxonomic diversity and ecological roles of actinobacteria in soil environments.",
