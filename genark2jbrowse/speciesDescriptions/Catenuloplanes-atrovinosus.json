  "description": "Catenuloplanes atrovinosus is a species of actinobacteria, a group of gram-positive bacteria known for their filamentous growth and ability to produce diverse secondary metabolites. This species was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan.\n\nThe key features of Catenuloplanes atrovinosus are:\n\n1. Morphology: It forms branched, substrate-penetrating hyphae that can fragment into rod-shaped or coccoid elements.\n\n2. Colony characteristics: On agar media, the colonies of C. atrovinosus appear dark reddish-brown to violet in color.\n\n3. Chemotaxonomy: The cell wall of this species contains LL-diaminopimelic acid, which is a characteristic chemotaxonomic marker for actinobacteria. The major menaquinone is MK-9(H4).\n\n4. Physiology: C. atrovinosus is aerobic and mesophilic, growing optimally at temperatures around 28-30Â°C. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth.\n\n5. Secondary metabolites: This species is known to produce a reddish-brown pigment, likely a polyketide or carotenoid compound, which contributes to the distinctive colony color.\n\nThe genus Catenuloplanes belongs to the family Micromonosporaceae within the order Micromonosporales. Catenuloplanes atrovinosus is one of the few species described within this genus and represents a unique actinobacterial taxon found in soil environments.",
