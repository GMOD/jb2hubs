  "description": "Cavia porcellus, commonly known as the guinea pig, is a small rodent species that belongs to the family Caviidae. They are native to the Andes mountains of South America and have been domesticated for thousands of years, primarily as a food source and as pets.\n\nGuinea pigs are characterized by their stocky build, short legs, and rounded body shape. They have a compact head, large eyes, and short, rounded ears. Their fur can vary in color, with common variations including white, brown, black, and a combination of these colors. Guinea pigs are herbivorous, with a diet primarily consisting of grasses, vegetables, and hay.\n\nOne of the unique features of guinea pigs is their inability to synthesize their own vitamin C, which means they require a dietary source of this essential nutrient. They are known for their vocal communication, producing a range of sounds, including whistles, grunts, and purrs, which are used for various social interactions.\n\nGuinea pigs are social animals and typically live in small groups in the wild. They are prey species and have evolved various defense mechanisms, such as the ability to quickly change direction and run to escape predators. They have a relatively short lifespan, with an average of 5 to 7 years in captivity.",
