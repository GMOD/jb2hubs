  "description": "Cebidichthys violaceus, commonly known as the monkeyface prickleback, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Stichaeidae. It is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, primarily found along the coast of western North America, from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico.\n\nThe Cebidichthys violaceus is a small, elongated fish with a distinctive face that resembles the features of a monkey, hence the common name \"monkeyface prickleback.\" It typically grows to a maximum length of around 30 centimeters (12 inches). The fish's body is covered in small, sharp spines, which gives it a prickly appearance.\n\nThe coloration of Cebidichthys violaceus is quite unique, ranging from a deep violet or purple hue on the upper parts of the body to a paler, lighter shade on the lower portions. This vibrant coloration is believed to be an adaptation that helps the fish blend in with its rocky, kelp-dominated habitat.\n\nCebidichthys violaceus is an active, predatory fish that feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and mollusks. It is known to inhabit tide pools, rocky crevices, and kelp forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a consumer and potentially as prey for larger marine predators.\n\nDespite its distinctive appearance and ecological importance, the Cebidichthys violaceus is not widely studied, and its full life history and population dynamics are not yet fully understood by the scientific community.",
