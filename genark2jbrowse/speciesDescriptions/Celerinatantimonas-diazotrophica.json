  "description": "Celerinatantimonas diazotrophica is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium. The unique characteristic of this species is its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a process known as diazotrophy, which allows it to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3) that can be utilized by plants and other organisms.\n\nC. diazotrophica was first isolated from the roots of a mangrove plant, Avicennia marina, in Vietnam. It is capable of growing under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions, and it can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources.\n\nThe genome of C. diazotrophica has been sequenced, revealing the presence of genes involved in nitrogen fixation, as well as genes responsible for the production of plant growth-promoting substances, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). These characteristics suggest that C. diazotrophica may have potential applications in agriculture as a biofertilizer or plant growth-promoting agent.\n\nOverall, Celerinatantimonas diazotrophica is a unique, nitrogen-fixing bacterium with potential ecological and agricultural significance due to its ability to enhance plant growth and development.",
