  "description": "Celerinatantimonas yamalensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from permafrost soil samples collected in the Yamal Peninsula, Russia. It belongs to the genus Celerinatantimonas, which is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThis bacterium is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic organism. It is motile, with a single polar flagellum, and can grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C.\n\nCelerinatantimonas yamalensis is considered psychrotolerant, meaning it can thrive in cold environments. It is capable of utilizing a variety of carbon sources, including simple sugars, organic acids, and some complex carbohydrates.\n\nGenomic analysis has revealed that this species possesses genes involved in cold adaptation, such as those encoding cold-shock proteins and enzymes that can function at low temperatures. This genetic makeup likely contributes to its ability to survive and grow in the cold, permafrost-dominated environment where it was originally isolated.\n\nFurther studies on the physiology, ecology, and potential applications of Celerinatantimonas yamalensis may provide insights into the adaptations of microorganisms to extreme cold environments and their potential roles in cold-adapted ecosystems.",
