  "description": "Cellulomonas endometrii is a species of Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria. It was first isolated from the endometrium (the inner lining of the uterus) of a healthy woman.\n\nSome key characteristics of Cellulomonas endometrii:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are coccoid to short-rod shaped, typically 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Motility: The cells are non-motile.\n\n3. Metabolism: Cellulomonas endometrii is able to degrade cellulose, a key structural component of plant cell walls. It can use cellulose and related carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources.\n\n4. Taxonomic classification: Cellulomonas endometrii belongs to the genus Cellulomonas, which is part of the Actinobacteria phylum. This genus is known for its cellulolytic (cellulose-degrading) capabilities.\n\n5. Habitat and isolation: The bacterium was originally isolated from the endometrium of a healthy human female, suggesting it may be a natural inhabitant of the human female reproductive tract.\n\n6. Significance: As a cellulose-degrading bacterium found in the human body, Cellulomonas endometrii may play a role in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and maintenance of the uterine microbiome. Further research is needed to elucidate its exact ecological functions and potential applications.",
