  "description": "Cellulophaga fucicola is a species of bacterium that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming microorganism.\n\nCellulophaga fucicola is known for its ability to degrade cellulose, a structural component of plant cell walls. It was originally isolated from the surface of brown macroalgae, specifically the species Fucus, hence the name \"fucicola\" which means \"living on Fucus.\"\n\nThis bacterium is found in marine environments, particularly in association with macroalgae and other aquatic plants. It plays a role in the decomposition and recycling of organic matter in these ecosystems.\n\nCellulophaga fucicola is capable of producing a variety of enzymes, including cellulases, that allow it to break down cellulose and utilize it as a carbon and energy source. This metabolic capability makes it an important contributor to the carbon cycle in marine environments.\n\nThe specific physiological and ecological characteristics of Cellulophaga fucicola continue to be studied, as it represents an interesting model organism for understanding the role of cellulose-degrading bacteria in aquatic ecosystems.",
