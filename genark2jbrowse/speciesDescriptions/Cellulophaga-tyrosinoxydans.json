  "description": "Cellulophaga tyrosinoxydans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cellulophaga tyrosinoxydans is known for its ability to oxidize tyrosine, an amino acid, as a sole carbon and energy source.\n\nThis bacterium was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan. It is a chemoorganotrophic organism, which means it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. Cellulophaga tyrosinoxydans is also capable of degrading cellulose, a major structural component of plant cell walls.\n\nThe cells of Cellulophaga tyrosinoxydans are typically rod-shaped and can form yellow-pigmented colonies on agar plates. The bacterium is mesophilic, meaning it thrives in moderate temperature ranges, and is found in various natural environments, including soil and aquatic habitats.\n\nCellulophaga tyrosinoxydans is considered a potentially useful microorganism in applications such as bioremediation, where it could be employed to degrade and remove tyrosine-containing compounds from the environment.",
