  "description": "Cellulosimicrobium aquatile is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Cellulosimicrobium aquatile is known to be isolated from aquatic environments, such as freshwater and marine habitats.\n\nThe cells of this species are coccoid to short rod-shaped, and they can form aggregates or chains. Cellulosimicrobium aquatile is capable of hydrolyzing cellulose, a property that is characteristic of this genus. This ability to degrade cellulose makes this bacterium potentially interesting for applications related to biomass conversion and biofuel production.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Cellulosimicrobium aquatile include a temperature range of 20-37Â°C and a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. This species is considered to be a mesophilic bacterium, meaning it thrives in moderate temperature environments.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological role and potential biotechnological applications of Cellulosimicrobium aquatile in aquatic ecosystems.",
