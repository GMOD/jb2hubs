It is native to the southwest Pacific Ocean, found in coastal waters off eastern Australia, southern Japan, and other parts of the western Pacific region.\n\nCentroberyx affinis is a moderately sized fish, typically reaching lengths of around 30-40 cm. It has a deep, compressed body with a large, terminal mouth. The fish is characterized by its bright red or pinkish-red coloration, which extends throughout its body, fins, and even the mouth cavity. It has a well-developed, spiny dorsal fin and a rounded caudal fin.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit rocky and reef-associated environments, often found in close proximity to coral reefs or rocky outcrops. It is an omnivorous fish, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and mollusks, as well as smaller fish.\n\nCentroberyx affinis is considered an important commercial and recreational fish species in many regions of the Pacific. It is valued for its firm, white flesh and is commonly targeted by both commercial and recreational fisheries. The species plays a significant role in the ecosystem, serving as a prey item for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the marine environment.",
