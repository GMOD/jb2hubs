  "description": "Centrocercus urophasianus, commonly known as the greater sage-grouse, is a large gallinaceous bird species native to western North America. It is the largest grouse species in North America, with an average length of around 65-75 cm and a wingspan of 80-95 cm.\n\nThe greater sage-grouse is characterized by its distinctive plumage, with a grayish-brown body, black belly, and distinctive white ruff around the neck. The male birds have distinctive inflatable air sacs on their chests, which they use to produce a distinctive \"popping\" sound during their elaborate courtship displays.\n\nThese birds are adapted to live in sagebrush-dominated ecosystems, where they feed primarily on sagebrush leaves and other herbaceous plants. They are known for their complex mating rituals, where males gather in leks to perform elaborate displays to attract females.\n\nThe greater sage-grouse is considered a species of conservation concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as other human-caused impacts on their populations. Ongoing efforts to protect and restore sagebrush habitats are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique and iconic species.",
