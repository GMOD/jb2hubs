  "description": "Centropristis striata, commonly known as the black sea bass, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Serranidae. This species is found along the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe black sea bass is a demersal fish, meaning it lives and feeds near the seafloor. It typically has a deep, compressed body with a large mouth and prominent eyes. The coloration of this species can vary, ranging from dark brown to black, often with distinctive vertical stripes or bars along the body. These fish can grow up to 60 cm (24 inches) in length, but the average size is around 30-40 cm (12-16 inches).\n\nBlack sea bass are opportunistic carnivores, feeding on a variety of prey such as crustaceans, mollusks, and smaller fish. They inhabit various coastal and offshore habitats, including rocky reefs, artificial structures, and seagrass beds, often forming schools or aggregations.\n\nThis species is of commercial and recreational importance, as it is a popular target for both commercial and recreational fisheries along the eastern coast of the United States. The management and conservation of the black sea bass population are important to ensure the sustainability of this valuable marine resource.",
