  "description": "Ceraceosorus guamensis is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a filamentous fungus that forms fruit bodies on the surface of decaying plant material, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nThe fungus has a creamy to pale yellowish-brown color and a gelatinous, waxy texture. Its fruiting bodies are cup-shaped or disc-like, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The spore-bearing structures, known as asci, are located within the fruiting bodies and contain multiple spores.\n\nCeraceosorus guamensis is known to play a role in the decomposition of organic matter, particularly in forest ecosystems. It is considered a saprotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from decaying plant material rather than living hosts. The species was first described scientifically based on specimens collected from the island of Guam, which is located in the western Pacific Ocean.",
