  "description": "Ceratitis capitata, commonly known as the Mediterranean fruit fly or Medfly, is a species of fruit fly that belongs to the family Tephritidae. It is considered one of the most economically significant pests in agriculture, affecting a wide range of fruit and vegetable crops.\n\nThe Mediterranean fruit fly is native to sub-Saharan Africa but has since spread to many parts of the world, including the Mediterranean region, Central and South America, and parts of Asia and Australia. It is a small insect, typically measuring around 4-8 millimeters in length, with a distinctive yellow and black coloration.\n\nThe Medfly's life cycle consists of several stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The female flies lay their eggs inside ripe or ripening fruit, and the larvae, or maggots, feed on the fruit's flesh, causing significant damage and making the fruit unmarketable. The pupation stage occurs in the soil, and the adult flies emerge to continue the cycle.\n\nCeratitis capitata is considered a significant agricultural pest due to its ability to infest a wide range of host plants, its rapid reproductive rate, and its resistance to certain insecticides. Effective management of the Medfly often involves a combination of strategies, including the use of biological control agents, sterile insect technique, and the application of targeted pesticides.",
