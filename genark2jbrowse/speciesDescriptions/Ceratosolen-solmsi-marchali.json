  "description": "Ceratosolen solmsi marchali is a species of fig wasp belonging to the family Agaonidae. Fig wasps are small, specialized insects that play a crucial role in the pollination of fig trees (genus Ficus).\n\nCeratosolen solmsi marchali is the pollinator wasp for the Ficus solmsi tree species. It is a small, winged insect, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. The wasp has a slender body, with a distinct head, thorax, and abdomen. It possesses a pair of antennae and a pair of compound eyes, which are essential for navigating the complex fig environment.\n\nThe female Ceratosolen solmsi marchali wasp is responsible for pollinating the fig flowers by carrying pollen from one fig tree to another. It enters the fig through a small opening called the ostiole, where it lays its eggs within the fig's ovaries. In the process, the wasp also transfers pollen, enabling the fig to develop and mature.\n\nThis species of fig wasp is highly specialized and has a mutualistic relationship with the Ficus solmsi tree. The survival and reproduction of both the wasp and the tree depend on this intricate interaction, making Ceratosolen solmsi marchali an essential component of the ecosystem in which it resides.",
