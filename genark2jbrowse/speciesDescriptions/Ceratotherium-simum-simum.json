  "description": "Ceratotherium simum simum, commonly known as the southern white rhinoceros, is a subspecies of the white rhinoceros found in southern Africa. It is one of the largest terrestrial mammals, with a body length of up to 5.5 meters and a weight of up to 5,000 kilograms.\n\nThe southern white rhinoceros is characterized by its square-lipped mouth, which is adapted for grazing on grasses and other vegetation. It has two horns on its snout, with the front horn being the larger of the two. The horns are composed of keratin and can grow up to 1.5 meters in length.\n\nThis subspecies is generally social and lives in small groups, with a dominant male leading the herd. They are herbivorous and spend a significant portion of their time grazing. The southern white rhinoceros is considered a conservation success story, as its population has increased from a few hundred individuals in the late 19th century to over 20,000 today, making it the most abundant rhinoceros subspecies.\n\nHowever, the southern white rhinoceros remains threatened by poaching for its horns, which are highly valued in some traditional Asian medicines. Conservation efforts, including anti-poaching patrols and captive breeding programs, are crucial to ensuring the long-term survival of this iconic species.",
