  "description": "Cercopithecine alphaherpesvirus 2 is a species of virus that belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects Old World monkeys, such as macaques and baboons.\n\nThe virus is classified as an alphaherpesvirus due to its ability to establish latent infections in the sensory ganglia of its host, similar to other herpesviruses like herpes simplex virus (HSV) in humans. Cercopithecine alphaherpesvirus 2 is closely related to other primate herpesviruses, such as Herpes B virus, which can occasionally infect humans and cause a rare but potentially fatal zoonotic disease.\n\nThe virus is capable of causing various clinical manifestations in its natural host, including mild skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, and in some cases, more severe neurological complications. Cercopithecine alphaherpesvirus 2 is considered an important model system for understanding the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with primate herpesvirus infections.",
