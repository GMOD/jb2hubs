They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, fruits, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nCercopithecus albogularis is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting pressures in some areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this primate and its natural environment.",
