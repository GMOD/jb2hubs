The fur is generally gray or olive-green in color, with a lighter underside.\n\nThese monkeys are arboreal and primarily found in dense, humid forests, swamp forests, and gallery forests. They are known for their social behavior, living in small troops led by a dominant male. Their diet consists mainly of fruits, leaves, flowers, and some small invertebrates.\n\nDe Brazza's monkeys are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for bushmeat.
