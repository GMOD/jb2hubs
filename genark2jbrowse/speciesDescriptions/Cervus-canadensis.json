  "description": "Cervus canadensis, commonly known as the elk or wapiti, is a large species of deer native to North America. It is the second-largest deer species in the world, surpassed only by the moose.\n\nThe elk is a member of the Cervidae family and is characterized by its large size, distinctive antlers, and adaptations for living in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and mountainous regions. Adult males, known as bulls, can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters at the shoulder and weigh up to 500 kilograms, while females, known as cows, are typically smaller.\n\nThe elk's antlers are one of its most distinctive features, growing annually and shedding their velvet covering in the autumn. These antlers serve as a means of display and defense, playing a crucial role in the species' social dynamics and mating rituals.\n\nElk are herbivores, primarily consuming grasses, forbs, and woody vegetation. They are known for their impressive herd behavior, often forming large groups that migrate seasonally in search of food and suitable habitats.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across western North America, with populations found in Canada, the United States, and parts of Mexico. Elk are an important component of many ecosystems, serving as prey for predators and playing a role in shaping the vegetation and landscape.",
