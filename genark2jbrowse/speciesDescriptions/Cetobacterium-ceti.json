  "description": "Cetobacterium ceti is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia. It is an anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. Cetobacterium ceti was first isolated from the intestinal tract of whales (Cetacea), hence the name \"ceti\" which refers to Cetacea.\n\nThis bacterium is known to be a common inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract of various cetacean species, including whales, dolphins, and porpoises. It plays a role in the digestion and metabolism of the host, contributing to the overall gut microbiome of these marine mammals.\n\nCetobacterium ceti is capable of fermenting a variety of carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids as metabolic end-products. This metabolic activity likely provides energy and nutrients to the host animal. The presence of Cetobacterium ceti in the gut of cetaceans is considered an important part of the symbiotic relationship between these bacteria and their marine mammal hosts.\n\nFurther research on the ecology, physiology, and potential applications of Cetobacterium ceti may provide insights into the complex interactions between cetaceans and their gut microbiome, which can have implications for the health and conservation of these marine species.",
