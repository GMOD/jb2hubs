  "description": "Chandipura virus (CHPV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae and the genus Vesiculovirus. It is primarily known as a pathogen that can cause severe acute febrile illness and encephalitis in humans.\n\nThe virus was first isolated in 1965 from the Chandipura village in the Indian state of Maharashtra, hence the name \"Chandipura virus.\" It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected sandflies (Phlebotomus species) and is considered an emerging infectious disease in parts of India and other South Asian countries.\n\nThe Chandipura virus genome is approximately 11.1 kilobases in length and encodes five structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L). These proteins play critical roles in the virus's replication, assembly, and interaction with host cells.\n\nInfection with Chandipura virus can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including fever, headache, vomiting, and, in severe cases, neurological complications such as encephalitis, which can be life-threatening. The virus is believed to have a higher case-fatality rate compared to other viral encephalitis-causing agents in the region.\n\nOngoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions for Chandipura virus infection, which remains a public health concern in the affected areas.",
