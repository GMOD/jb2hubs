  "description": "The Chandiru virus is a newly discovered member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It was first isolated from ticks collected in the Chandiru region of Peru in 2019. The Chandiru virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks, particularly those of the Amblyomma genus.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that the Chandiru virus is most closely related to other Phlebovirus species found in South America, such as the Heartland virus and the Palma virus. However, the Chandiru virus has a distinct genetic profile, suggesting it is a unique viral species.\n\nLimited studies on the Chandiru virus have shown that it can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including small rodents and livestock. The virus appears to cause a febrile illness in humans, with symptoms that may include headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal distress. However, the full clinical manifestations and epidemiology of Chandiru virus infections in humans are still under investigation.\n\nOngoing research is focused on further characterizing the Chandiru virus, understanding its transmission dynamics, and assessing its potential public health impact in the regions where it has been detected. Continued surveillance and study of this newly emerged virus are crucial for understanding its potential risks and developing appropriate prevention and control strategies.",
