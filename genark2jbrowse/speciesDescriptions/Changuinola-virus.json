  "description": "Changuinola virus is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus, which belongs to the family Peribunyaviridae. It is a zoonotic virus that is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus Culex.\n\nThe Changuinola virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome is composed of three segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the two viral glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nChanguinola virus was first isolated in 1960 from mosquitoes collected in Changuinola, Panama. It has been reported to cause febrile illness in humans, with symptoms including headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, the full spectrum of clinical manifestations and the public health significance of this virus are not yet fully understood.\n\nFurther research is needed to better characterize the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health impact of the Changuinola virus.",
