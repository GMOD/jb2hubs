  "description": "Cheilinus undulatus, commonly known as the humphead wrasse or Napoleon wrasse, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Labridae (wrasses). It is one of the largest known species of wrasse, with individuals reaching up to 2 meters (6.6 feet) in length and weighing up to 190 kilograms (420 pounds).\n\nThe humphead wrasse is characterized by its distinctive large, protruding lips, which give the fish a unique and almost comical appearance. Its body is typically a mottled green-brown color with a series of wavy, undulating lines running along its sides, which is the source of its species name \"undulatus.\" The fish also has a prominent hump on its head, which becomes more pronounced as the individual matures.\n\nHumphead wrasses are found in coral reef habitats throughout the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea and East Africa to the central Pacific Ocean. They are known to be slow-growing and long-lived, with some individuals estimated to live for over 30 years. These fish play an important role in the coral reef ecosystem, as they feed on a variety of invertebrates and smaller fishes.\n\nDue to their large size, unique appearance, and economic value in the live reef fish trade, humphead wrasses have become a conservation concern, with populations declining in many parts of their range. They are classified as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and their trade is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).",
