  "description": "Cheirogaleus medius, commonly known as the fat-tailed dwarf lemur, is a species of small nocturnal primate found in the tropical forests of eastern Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cheirogaleidae, which includes several species of dwarf lemurs.\n\nThe fat-tailed dwarf lemur is characterized by its distinctive round, plump body and a large, fatty tail that serves as a energy reserve during the dry season when food is scarce. It has large, forward-facing eyes and a pointed snout, which are adaptations for its nocturnal lifestyle. The fur coloration ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, with a lighter underside.\n\nThese lemurs are arboreal and primarily feed on fruits, flowers, nectar, and insects. They exhibit a unique behavior called \"hibernation-like torpor,\" where they enter a state of reduced metabolism and body temperature during the dry season to conserve energy. This adaptation allows them to survive periods of food scarcity.\n\nCheirogaleus medius is found in several protected areas within its limited geographic range in eastern Madagascar. The species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but its populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities.",
