  "description": "Chelmon rostratus, commonly known as the Beaked Coralfish or Copperband Butterflyfish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Chaetodontidae. It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, found in coral reef habitats from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian Islands and Marquesas.\n\nThis species is characterized by its distinctive elongated snout, which it uses to feed on small invertebrates, such as coral polyps, zooplankton, and small crustaceans, within the crevices and coral structures of its environment. The body of the Chelmon rostratus is laterally compressed and exhibits a striking coloration pattern, with a black and white striped pattern that extends from the snout to the tail.\n\nThe Beaked Coralfish is a popular aquarium fish due to its unique appearance and relatively hardy nature, though it can be challenging to care for in captivity, as it requires a well-established, high-quality reef environment to thrive. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species, as it is vulnerable to habitat degradation and collection for the ornamental fish trade.",
