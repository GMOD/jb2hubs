  "description": "Chenggangzhangella methanolivorans is a species of anaerobic, methanogenic archaeon that was isolated from a methanogenic enrichment culture obtained from a rice field soil sample. The cells of C. methanolivorans are coccoid in shape and stain Gram-negative. They are capable of utilizing methanol as the sole carbon and energy source, converting it to methane through a process known as methanogenesis.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. methanolivorans belongs to the order Methanomicrobiales within the phylum Euryarchaeota, which comprises a diverse group of methanogenic archaea. The genome of C. methanolivorans has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the rice field environment.\n\nThis species plays a role in the global carbon cycle, contributing to the production of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in anaerobic environments such as rice fields. The study of C. methanolivorans and other methanogens is important for understanding the complex microbial communities involved in the cycling of carbon and the production of methane in various ecosystems.",
