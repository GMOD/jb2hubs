  "description": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) that belongs to the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus.\n\nCHIKV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The virus genome encodes four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4) and three structural proteins (capsid, envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2). The virus utilizes host cell machinery for its replication and assembly, leading to the production of new infectious viral particles.\n\nInfection with CHIKV can cause a disease known as chikungunya fever, which is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, severe joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and a rash. The joint pain associated with CHIKV infection can be debilitating and may persist for weeks or even months after the initial illness.\n\nCHIKV is primarily found in Africa and Asia, but it has also been reported in other regions, including Europe and the Americas, due to the global spread of the Aedes mosquito vectors. The virus has the potential to cause outbreaks and epidemics, and it is considered an emerging public health concern in many parts of the world.",
