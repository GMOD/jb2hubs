  "description": "Chiloscyllium plagiosum, commonly known as the white-spotted bamboo shark, is a species of carpet shark found in the waters of the Indo-Pacific region. It is a small, bottom-dwelling shark that belongs to the family Hemiscylliidae.\n\nThe white-spotted bamboo shark is characterized by its slender, elongated body and distinctive coloration. Its dorsal surface is typically a light brown or grayish-brown color, with a pattern of white spots or blotches scattered across its body. These white spots help camouflage the shark in its natural environment, which often includes coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sandy or muddy substrates.\n\nThis species has a wide distribution, ranging from the Red Sea and the east coast of Africa to southern Japan and northern Australia. It is known to inhabit coastal and shallow offshore waters, typically at depths of less than 100 meters.\n\nThe white-spotted bamboo shark is a relatively small shark, with a maximum recorded length of around 90 centimeters. It is a benthic predator, feeding primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. The species is ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the young are born live.\n\nDue to its small size and relatively docile nature, the white-spotted bamboo shark is not considered a threat to humans. However, it is listed as Near Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, primarily due to habitat loss and exploitation for the aquarium trade.",
