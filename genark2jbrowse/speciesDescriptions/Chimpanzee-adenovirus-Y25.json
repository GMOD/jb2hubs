  "description": "Chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 is a non-human primate adenovirus that was isolated from chimpanzees. Adenoviruses are a family of double-stranded DNA viruses that can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans and other primates.\n\nChimpanzee adenovirus Y25 is a member of the genus Simiadenovirus, which includes adenoviruses found in various non-human primate species. The virus has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome that is approximately 35 kilobases in length and encodes for multiple proteins involved in viral replication, assembly, and host interactions.\n\nChimpanzee adenovirus Y25 is of interest as a potential viral vector for use in gene therapy and vaccine development, as non-human primate adenoviruses may have lower pre-existing immunity in human populations compared to human adenoviruses. Further research is needed to understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential applications of this specific chimpanzee adenovirus strain.",
