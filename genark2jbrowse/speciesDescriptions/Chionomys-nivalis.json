  "description": "Chionomys nivalis, commonly known as the snow vole or white-tailed vole, is a small rodent species belonging to the subfamily Arvicolinae. This species is found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, typically inhabiting alpine and sub-alpine environments at high elevations.\n\nThe snow vole is characterized by its dense, soft, and thick fur that is typically grayish-brown in color, with a distinctive white underside and a white-tipped tail. This adaptation helps the animal blend in with the snowy environments it inhabits. The species has a robust body, short limbs, and a rounded head, typical of voles.\n\nSnow voles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other alpine vegetation. They are known to be active both during the day and night, and they construct elaborate burrow systems in the soil or under rocks for shelter and nesting.\n\nThese voles play an important role in the mountain ecosystems they inhabit, serving as a food source for various predators, such as birds of prey, carnivorous mammals, and reptiles. They also contribute to the dispersal of plant seeds and the cycling of nutrients in the soil through their burrowing and foraging activities.\n\nThe snow vole is generally considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats to its population. However, the species may be affected by habitat loss, climate change, and human activities in some regions.",
