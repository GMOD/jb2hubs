  "description": "Chitinophaga terrae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Chitinophaga terrae is known for its ability to degrade chitin, a structural polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and cell walls of fungi.\n\nThe cells of Chitinophaga terrae are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-3.5 μm in length. They are motile, possessing gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for Chitinophaga terrae is around 30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nChitinophaga terrae was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. It is known to play a role in the natural recycling of chitin in the environment, contributing to the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. The species has potential applications in the production of chitinase enzymes, which have various industrial and agricultural uses.",
