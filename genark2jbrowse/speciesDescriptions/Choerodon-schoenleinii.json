  "description": "Choerodon schoenleinii, commonly known as the Schönlein's wrasse, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Labridae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in coastal waters and coral reef habitats.\n\nThe Schönlein's wrasse is characterized by a robust, elongated body with a blunt, rounded snout. It typically exhibits a vibrant coloration, with a predominant reddish-orange hue on the upper parts of the body, transitioning to a yellowish-white on the lower parts. The fins are often tinged with blue or purple.\n\nThis species is known to feed primarily on a variety of invertebrates, such as crustaceans, mollusks, and small fishes, which it locates and captures using its powerful jaws and specialized dentition. The Schönlein's wrasse plays an important role in the ecological balance of the coral reef ecosystem, contributing to the maintenance of a healthy and diverse marine community.\n\nRegarding its behavior, the Schönlein's wrasse is typically observed as a solitary or small-group dwelling fish, often found in close association with rocky outcrops, coral reefs, or seagrass beds. It is a relatively active and territorial species, engaging in courtship displays and defending its feeding and breeding grounds.\n\nThe Schönlein's wrasse is of interest to the aquarium trade and is sometimes targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries, though its overall conservation status is considered to be of Least Concern according to the IUCN Red List.",
