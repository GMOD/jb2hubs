  "description": "Chryseobacterium contaminans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Chryseobacterium genus, which is a part of the Flavobacteriaceae family. This Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium was first isolated from a water sample collected from a contaminated site.\n\nChryseobacterium contaminans is characterized by its yellowish or orange-pigmented colonies, which is a common feature of bacteria within the Chryseobacterium genus. The cells are typically rod-shaped and can range in size from 0.5 to 0.8 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 5.0 micrometers in length.\n\nThis species is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been found in various environmental sources, including water, soil, and clinical samples. It has been associated with occasional human infections, primarily in immunocompromised individuals, though its pathogenic potential is not fully understood.\n\nTaxonomically, Chryseobacterium contaminans was first described and named in 2006 based on its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, which distinguish it from other Chryseobacterium species. Further research is ongoing to better understand the ecology, distribution, and potential clinical significance of this bacterial species.",
