  "description": "Chryseobacterium formosense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Taiwan, an island located in East Asia. It belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is a group of Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria.\n\nThe cells of C. formosense are rod-shaped and exhibit a yellow pigmentation, which is a characteristic feature of the genus Chryseobacterium. This species is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that C. formosense is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, such as Chryseobacterium indologenes and Chryseobacterium gleum. However, it can be distinguished from these closely related species based on various biochemical and physiological characteristics.\n\nThe isolation and identification of C. formosense contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bacteria in the natural environment, particularly in the soil ecosystem of Taiwan. Further research on this species may provide insights into its potential roles and applications in various fields, such as biotechnology or environmental remediation.",
