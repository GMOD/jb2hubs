  "description": "Chryseobacterium potabilaquae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nSome key characteristics of Chryseobacterium potabilaquae:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-3.0 μm long.\n\n2. Pigmentation: Colonies on agar plates are yellow or yellowish-orange in color, due to the production of carotenoid pigments.\n\n3. Habitat: Chryseobacterium potabilaquae has been isolated from drinking water and water distribution systems, indicating its ability to survive and thrive in potable water environments.\n\n4. Metabolism: It is an obligate aerobe, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and energy production. The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive.\n\n5. Genomic features: Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence has been used to identify and classify Chryseobacterium potabilaquae as a distinct species within the genus Chryseobacterium.\n\n6. Significance: As a member of the Chryseobacterium genus, Chryseobacterium potabilaquae is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with rare cases of human infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Its presence in drinking water systems is of interest for water quality monitoring and management.",
