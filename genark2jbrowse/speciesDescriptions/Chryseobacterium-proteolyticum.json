  "description": "Chryseobacterium proteolyticum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nChryseobacterium proteolyticum is known for its ability to produce proteolytic enzymes, which are enzymes that can break down proteins. This characteristic is reflected in its species name, \"proteolyticum,\" which means \"protein-degrading.\"\n\nThe cells of Chryseobacterium proteolyticum are typically rod-shaped and exhibit yellow or orange pigmentation, a common feature among members of the genus Chryseobacterium. These bacteria are typically found in a variety of environmental sources, such as soil, water, and plant materials.\n\nChryseobacterium proteolyticum has been studied for its potential applications in various industrial and biotechnological processes, particularly in the field of enzyme production and protein degradation. Its proteolytic capabilities may be useful in areas such as waste management, bioremediation, and the production of protein hydrolysates for various purposes.",
