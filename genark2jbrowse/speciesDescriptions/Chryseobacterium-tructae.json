  "description": "Chryseobacterium tructae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium.\n\nChryseobacterium tructae was first isolated from the intestine of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a species of freshwater fish. The bacterium is known to be associated with the microbiome of this fish species.\n\nPhylogenetically, Chryseobacterium tructae is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, and its genome analysis has revealed the presence of genes involved in various metabolic pathways, including the utilization of different carbon sources and the production of enzymes that may play a role in the bacterial-host interactions within the fish gut.\n\nThe identification and characterization of Chryseobacterium tructae have contributed to the understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of bacteria associated with the gastrointestinal tract of aquatic organisms, which can have implications for fish health and aquaculture management.",
