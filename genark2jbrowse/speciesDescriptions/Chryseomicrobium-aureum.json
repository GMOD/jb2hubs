  "description": "Chryseomicrobium aureum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Chryseomicrobium genus. This genus is classified under the Cytophagaceae family, which is part of the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n\nChryseomicrobium aureum is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It has a distinctive golden-yellow pigmentation, which is due to the production of carotenoid pigments. The cells are typically rod-shaped and exhibit gliding motility.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil samples collected in China. It is known to grow optimally at temperatures around 30Â°C and at a neutral pH range. Chryseomicrobium aureum is considered an environmental bacterium, commonly found in soil and sediment habitats.\n\nThe golden-yellow pigmentation and the ability to grow under aerobic conditions are the key distinguishing features of Chryseomicrobium aureum among other members of the Chryseomicrobium genus. Further studies on the ecology, physiology, and potential applications of this bacterium are ongoing.",
