  "description": "Cinara cedri is a species of aphid that primarily feeds on cedar trees, particularly the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) and the Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani). It is a member of the family Cinariidae, which are known as conifer aphids.\n\nCinara cedri is a relatively large aphid, measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. It has a rounded, oval-shaped body and a pair of long, slender antennae. The body is typically dark brown or gray in color, with a waxy or powdery appearance. The aphid has a pair of cornicles, which are tube-like structures on the posterior end of the abdomen, used for the release of defensive secretions.\n\nThese aphids primarily feed on the sap of cedar trees, using their long, slender mouthparts to pierce the plant tissues and extract the nutrient-rich fluids. They can form large colonies on the branches and trunks of their host plants, potentially causing damage to the tree's growth and appearance.\n\nCinara cedri is widely distributed across the Mediterranean region, where its host plants, the Atlas and Lebanon cedars, are native. It is an important pest species in forestry and landscape management, as heavy infestations can lead to reduced tree vigor, stunted growth, and in some cases, the death of the affected trees.",
