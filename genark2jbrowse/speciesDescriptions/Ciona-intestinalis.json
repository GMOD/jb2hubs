  "description": "Ciona intestinalis is a species of tunicate, commonly known as the sea squirt or sea vase. It is a marine invertebrate belonging to the subphylum Tunicata, which is part of the phylum Chordata, the same phylum that includes vertebrates such as humans.\n\nCiona intestinalis is a sessile, filter-feeding organism that attaches itself to hard substrates such as rocks, docks, or the hulls of ships. It has a soft, gelatinous, sac-like body with two siphons, one for drawing in water and the other for expelling it. This water flow allows the animal to filter and feed on plankton and other small particles suspended in the water.\n\nThe species is considered a model organism in developmental biology and evolutionary studies due to its relatively simple body plan and the availability of its genome sequence. Ciona intestinalis has been extensively studied for its potential use in regenerative medicine and biomedical research, as it possesses remarkable regenerative abilities and shares some genetic similarities with vertebrates.\n\nOverall, Ciona intestinalis is an important component of marine ecosystems and a valuable model organism for understanding the evolution and development of chordates, including vertebrates.",
