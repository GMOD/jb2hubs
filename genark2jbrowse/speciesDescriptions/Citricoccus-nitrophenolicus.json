  "description": "Citricoccus nitrophenolicus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Citricoccus, which is a part of the phylum Actinobacteria. This species was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan.\n\nCitricoccus nitrophenolicus is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccoid bacterium. It has the ability to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of Citricoccus nitrophenolicus is its ability to utilize nitrophenols, a class of aromatic compounds, as a sole carbon and energy source. This metabolic capability makes this species potentially useful in the bioremediation of nitrophenol-contaminated environments.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Citricoccus nitrophenolicus is closely related to other Citricoccus species, but it can be differentiated from them based on its unique physiological and biochemical properties.\n\nFurther research on the ecology, genetics, and potential applications of Citricoccus nitrophenolicus may provide insights into its role in the environment and its potential use in biotechnological processes.",
