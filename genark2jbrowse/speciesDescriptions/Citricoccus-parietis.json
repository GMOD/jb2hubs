  "description": "Citricoccus parietis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccus-shaped bacterium. Citricoccus parietis was first isolated from a wall surface in a residential building.\n\nThe cells of Citricoccus parietis are typically 0.8-1.2 μm in diameter and occur singly or in pairs. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow-pigmented. The optimum growth temperature for Citricoccus parietis is around 30°C, and it can grow in the pH range of 6.0-9.0.\n\nBiochemically, Citricoccus parietis is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon sources for growth. It is also capable of hydrolyzing Tween 80 and esculin. Citricoccus parietis is considered a non-pathogenic bacterium, and its ecological role in the built environment is not yet fully understood.",
