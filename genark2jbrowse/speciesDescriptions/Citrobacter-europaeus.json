  "description": "Citrobacter europaeus is a species of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It was first isolated from environmental samples collected in Europe and was subsequently recognized as a distinct species within the Citrobacter genus.\n\nCitrobacter europaeus is characterized by its ability to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, lactose, and sucrose. It is also capable of producing hydrogen sulfide and can be motile due to the presence of peritrichous flagella.\n\nEcologically, Citrobacter europaeus is commonly found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of various animals, including humans. While it is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen, it has been associated with rare clinical cases of infections, such as urinary tract infections and bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nTaxonomically, Citrobacter europaeus is closely related to other Citrobacter species, such as Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter koseri, which are more commonly encountered in clinical settings. The identification and differentiation of Citrobacter europaeus from other Citrobacter species typically involve biochemical tests and molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing.",
