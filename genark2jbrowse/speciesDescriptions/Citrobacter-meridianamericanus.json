  "description": "Citrobacter meridianamericanus is a species of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Citrobacter. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in Central America.\n\nThe key features of Citrobacter meridianamericanus are:\n\n1. Taxonomy: It is classified within the family Enterobacteriaceae, which includes several other clinically relevant bacterial species.\n\n2. Morphology: Cells are short, non-spore-forming rods that measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\n3. Growth characteristics: The bacterium is facultatively anaerobic, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates and produce acid as a byproduct.\n\n4. Biochemical properties: Citrobacter meridianamericanus is positive for catalase and oxidase activities. It can utilize citrate as a sole carbon source and is able to decarboxylate lysine.\n\n5. Habitat and distribution: This species has been isolated from soil samples collected in Central and South America, suggesting it is indigenous to that geographic region.\n\n6. Significance: While Citrobacter meridianamericanus is not considered a major human pathogen, some Citrobacter species can occasionally cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecology and potential clinical relevance of this particular bacterial species.",
