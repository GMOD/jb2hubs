  "description": "Citrobacter telavivensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Citrobacter. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium. Citrobacter telavivensis was first isolated from soil samples collected in Tel Aviv, Israel, hence the name \"telavivensis.\"\n\nThis species is known to be capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, lactose, and sucrose, and can produce gas as a by-product of this process. Citrobacter telavivensis is also capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite, a characteristic that can be used for its identification and differentiation from other Citrobacter species.\n\nCitrobacter telavivensis is considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions. However, its clinical significance and potential pathogenicity are not well-studied, and more research is needed to fully understand its role in human health and disease.",
