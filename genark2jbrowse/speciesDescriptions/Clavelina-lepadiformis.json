  "description": "Clavelina lepadiformis is a species of colonial ascidian, commonly known as the light bulb sea squirt or light bulb tunicate. It belongs to the phylum Chordata, class Ascidiacea, and order Aplousobranchia.\n\nThis species is found in marine environments, typically in the intertidal and subtidal zones of temperate and subtropical regions. Clavelina lepadiformis forms colonies composed of numerous individual zooids, which are interconnected through a common vascular system.\n\nThe zooids have a distinctive light bulb-shaped appearance, with a transparent tunic (outer covering) that allows the internal organs to be visible. Each zooid has a siphon-like structure that is used for both the intake of water and the expulsion of waste and reproductive products.\n\nClavelina lepadiformis is a filter-feeding organism, capturing small plankton and suspended particles from the surrounding water. The colonies can form dense aggregations, contributing to the diversity and structure of marine communities.\n\nThis species is of interest in the field of marine biology and ecology, as it plays a role in benthic community dynamics and can serve as a bioindicator of environmental conditions.",
