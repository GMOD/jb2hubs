  "description": "Clostridioides difficile R20291 is a spore-forming, Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium that is a significant cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). This strain, R20291, is a well-characterized and widely-studied isolate of C. difficile that belongs to the hypervirulent ribotype 027 (RT027) lineage.\n\nThe R20291 strain is known to produce two major toxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), which are the primary virulence factors responsible for the development of C. difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis. Additionally, this strain has been observed to produce a binary toxin (CDT), which may contribute to its increased virulence compared to other C. difficile strains.\n\nGenomic analysis of the R20291 strain has revealed the presence of various antibiotic resistance genes, including those conferring resistance to fluoroquinolones, which has been associated with the emergence and global spread of this hypervirulent lineage. The ability of C. difficile R20291 to form highly resistant spores that can survive in the environment and be transmitted between hosts is also a significant factor in its epidemiological success.\n\nUnderstanding the unique characteristics of the C. difficile R20291 strain has been crucial for developing effective strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CDI caused by this problematic pathogen.",
