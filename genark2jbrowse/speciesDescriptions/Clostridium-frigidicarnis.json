  "description": "Clostridium frigidicarnis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that was isolated from meat products stored at low temperatures. The name \"frigidicarnis\" refers to its ability to grow and thrive in cold environments, such as refrigerated or frozen meat.\n\nThis bacterium is a member of the Clostridium genus, which includes several species known for their ability to produce spores that can withstand harsh environmental conditions. Clostridium frigidicarnis is a psychrotolerant (cold-tolerant) species, capable of growing at temperatures as low as 4°C (39°F).\n\nThe cells of Clostridium frigidicarnis are typically rod-shaped and can form oval-shaped spores. They are non-motile and do not produce gas during fermentation. The bacterium is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates and amino acids as energy sources, allowing it to adapt to the nutrient-rich environment of refrigerated or frozen meat products.\n\nClostridium frigidicarnis is of interest in the food industry due to its potential spoilage of chilled or frozen meat products. Its ability to grow at low temperatures can lead to the deterioration of meat quality and the production of off-odors or off-flavors, making it a concern for food safety and preservation.",
