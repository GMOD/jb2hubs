  "description": "Clostridium tanneri is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacterium. It was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a human patient. \n\nC. tanneri is a member of the Clostridium genus, which is known for its ability to produce endospores that allow the bacteria to survive in harsh environmental conditions. As an anaerobe, C. tanneri grows best in the absence of oxygen.\n\nMorphologically, C. tanneri cells are typically rod-shaped and can form terminal or subterminal spores. The bacterium is non-motile and does not produce any noticeable pigments.\n\nPhysiologically, C. tanneri is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, producing end products such as acetic acid, butyric acid, and hydrogen gas. It is also capable of hydrolyzing gelatin.\n\nTaxonomically, C. tanneri belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridia class. Genetic analysis has shown that it is closely related to other Clostridium species, but it has distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics that differentiate it as a unique species.\n\nThe role and significance of C. tanneri in the human gut microbiome or in any pathogenic processes are still being actively investigated by researchers.",
