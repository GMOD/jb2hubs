  "description": "Clupea harengus, commonly known as the Atlantic herring, is a small, pelagic schooling fish that belongs to the family Clupeidae. It is one of the most abundant and commercially important fish species in the world.\n\nThe Atlantic herring is a slender, silvery-blue fish with a compressed body and a protruding lower jaw. It typically measures between 20 to 30 centimeters in length, with a maximum length of around 45 centimeters. These fish are found in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the east coast of North America to the coast of Europe.\n\nHerring are filter feeders, primarily consuming small planktonic crustaceans, such as copepods and krill, as well as small fish and fish eggs. They play a crucial role in the marine food web, serving as a vital food source for a variety of predators, including larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nClupea harengus is known for its migratory behavior, undertaking seasonal movements between spawning, feeding, and overwintering grounds. These migrations are influenced by factors such as water temperature, salinity, and food availability. The species is a highly prolific spawner, with females capable of producing up to 200,000 eggs per spawning event.\n\nThe Atlantic herring is of great economic importance, with commercial fisheries targeting this species for human consumption, as well as for use in the production of fish oil and fish meal. Its abundance and role in the ecosystem make it a key indicator of the health and productivity of marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic region.",
