  "description": "Clytia hemisphaerica is a species of marine hydrozoan, commonly known as the common sea-fur or the hemispheric hydroid. It belongs to the phylum Cnidaria, class Hydrozoa, and order Leptothecata.\n\nClytia hemisphaerica is a colonial organism, with individual polyps growing from a network of tubular stems called a hydrocaulus. The polyps have a bell-shaped body, known as a hydranth, which is typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The hydranths are equipped with tentacles that are used to capture small prey, such as zooplankton, for nourishment.\n\nThe life cycle of Clytia hemisphaerica includes both a sessile, attached polyp stage and a free-swimming medusa stage. The medusa stage is a small, transparent, umbrella-shaped jellyfish that can be released from the polyps and contribute to the species' dispersal and reproduction.\n\nClytia hemisphaerica is widely distributed in coastal and offshore marine environments, often found growing on various substrates, such as rocks, shells, and submerged structures. It plays a role in the aquatic food web as a predator and as prey for small marine organisms.",
