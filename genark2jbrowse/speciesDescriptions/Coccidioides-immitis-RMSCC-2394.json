  "description": "Coccidioides immitis RMSCC 2394 is a species of dimorphic fungus that causes the disease coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever. It is a soil-dwelling organism found primarily in the southwestern United States, as well as parts of Central and South America.\n\nThis particular strain, RMSCC 2394, was isolated from a clinical sample and is maintained in the Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Coccidioidomycosis Collection (RMSCC). Coccidioides immitis exhibits a unique life cycle, transitioning between a mycelial form in the soil and a spherical, spore-producing form known as a spherule when infecting a host.\n\nThe spherules of C. immitis RMSCC 2394 are typically 20-80 micrometers in diameter and contain endospores, which are released when the spherule ruptures. These endospores can then develop into new spherules, perpetuating the infection cycle. Inhalation of the airborne spores is the primary mode of transmission, leading to a range of clinical manifestations in humans, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe, life-threatening disseminated disease.\n\nFurther research on this particular strain of C. immitis may contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential treatment strategies for coccidioidomycosis.",
