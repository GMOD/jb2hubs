  "description": "Cochliomyia hominivorax, commonly known as the New World Screwworm, is a species of fly that belongs to the family Calliphoridae. This parasitic insect is native to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nThe New World Screwworm is known for its ability to infect and feed on the living flesh of warm-blooded animals, including humans. The adult flies lay their eggs on open wounds or natural body orifices of the host. The hatched larvae, or maggots, then burrow into the host's tissue, causing severe tissue damage and potentially leading to death if left untreated.\n\nThe larvae of C. hominivorax are characterized by their distinctive spiral or \"screw-like\" appearance, which gives the species its common name. These maggots possess a series of small hooks along their bodies that allow them to grip and move through the host's tissue.\n\nThe New World Screwworm has had a significant impact on livestock and agricultural industries in the Americas, causing substantial economic losses due to the harm it can inflict on domesticated animals. However, through the development of successful eradication programs, the species has been eliminated from several regions, including the United States and Central America.",
