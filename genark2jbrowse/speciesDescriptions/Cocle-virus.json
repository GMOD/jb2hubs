  "description": "Cocle virus is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. The virus was first isolated in 1972 from stool samples of children with acute gastroenteritis in the Cocle province of Panama.\n\nStructurally, the Cocle virus particle is icosahedral in shape and measures approximately 30 nanometers in diameter. The viral genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is processed into the structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication.\n\nCocle virus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and it can cause acute gastroenteritis in infected individuals, particularly in young children. The clinical symptoms associated with Cocle virus infection include diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. In most cases, the illness is self-limiting and resolves within a few days to a week.\n\nCocle virus is a member of the human enterovirus species, which also includes other well-known pathogens such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus. Molecular epidemiological studies have revealed the presence of Cocle virus in various regions worldwide, suggesting its global distribution, although its prevalence and impact on public health may vary across different geographical areas.",
