  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no species known as \"Cognatishimia maritima\" in the scientific literature. This appears to be a made-up name that does not correspond to any real, documented organism.\n\nScientific species descriptions typically include the following key information:\n\n1. Taxonomic classification (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species)\n2. Physical description (size, morphology, coloration, etc.)\n3. Habitat and geographic distribution\n4. Ecological role and behavior\n5. Distinguishing features that separate the species from closely related taxa\n\nWithout a real organism to reference, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Scientific names follow specific naming conventions, and \"Cognatishimia maritima\" does not conform to those standards. If you have information about a real species you would like me to describe, please provide the actual scientific name, and I would be happy to research and summarize the relevant details.",
