  "description": "Cognatiyoonia koreensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. The bacterium is Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped. It is facultatively anaerobic, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. \n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. koreensis is closely related to members of the genus Bacillus. However, it forms a distinct clade within the Bacillus phylogenetic tree, indicating that it represents a novel genus. Biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as its ability to utilize various carbon sources and its DNA G+C content, further distinguish C. koreensis from other Bacillus species.\n\nThe discovery and description of C. koreensis contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bacterial species in soil environments, particularly in the Korean peninsula. Further research on the ecology, metabolism, and potential applications of this bacterium may provide insights into its role in soil ecosystems.",
