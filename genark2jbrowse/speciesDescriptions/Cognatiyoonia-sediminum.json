  "description": "Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed scientific description of the species Cognatiyoonia sediminum. This appears to be a rather obscure or potentially hypothetical species, and without access to authoritative scientific references or data on its characteristics, I cannot confidently give a comprehensive overview.\n\nIn general, a short scientific description of a species would typically include details such as:\n\n1. Taxonomic classification: The kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species of the organism.\n\n2. Physical characteristics: A description of the organism's size, shape, color, morphological features, etc.\n\n3. Habitat and distribution: The natural environment and geographic range where the species is typically found.\n\n4. Ecological role: The species' trophic level, interactions with other organisms, and position within its ecosystem.\n\n5. Biological features: Aspects of the species' life cycle, reproduction, and other key biological processes.\n\nWithout reliable sources of information about the specific characteristics of Cognatiyoonia sediminum, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. More research would be needed to accurately detail the features and attributes of this particular organism.",
