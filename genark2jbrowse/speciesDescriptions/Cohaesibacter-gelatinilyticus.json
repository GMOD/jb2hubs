  "description": "Cohaesibacter gelatinilyticus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from a marine environment and is known for its ability to degrade gelatin, a protein-based compound commonly found in various natural and industrial settings.\n\nThe cells of Cohaesibacter gelatinilyticus are typically rod-shaped and exhibit a gram-negative cell wall structure. They are facultatively anaerobic, meaning they can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. The species is capable of utilizing a range of carbohydrates and organic compounds as carbon and energy sources.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of Cohaesibacter gelatinilyticus is its ability to produce extracellular enzymes that can hydrolyze (break down) gelatin. This property makes the species potentially useful in various applications, such as in the food industry, where it could be employed in the processing or degradation of gelatin-containing materials.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Cohaesibacter gelatinilyticus include a slightly alkaline pH and moderate temperatures, typically found in marine or estuarine environments. This bacterium has been isolated from various marine habitats, indicating its ability to thrive in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Cohaesibacter gelatinilyticus is a specialized bacterium that has gained attention due to its unique gelatin-degrading capabilities, which may have implications for industrial and environmental applications.",
