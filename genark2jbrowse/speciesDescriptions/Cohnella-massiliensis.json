  "description": "Cohnella massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human stool sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the genus Cohnella, which is a group of aerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nThe key characteristics of Cohnella massiliensis are as follows:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm wide and 1.5-3.0 μm long.\n\n2. Spore formation: This species is able to form endospores, which are resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive in adverse environmental conditions.\n\n3. Oxygen requirement: Cohnella massiliensis is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism.\n\n4. Temperature range: The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 37°C (98.6°F), although it can grow at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 45°C (77°F to 113°F).\n\n5. Biochemical properties: Cohnella massiliensis is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon and energy sources.\n\n6. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Cohnella massiliensis is closely related to other members of the genus Cohnella, which are commonly found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of various organisms.\n\nThis species was initially isolated from a human fecal sample, suggesting that it may be a member of the normal gut microbiota in some individuals. However, its specific role and potential interactions within the human gut ecosystem are still under investigation.",
