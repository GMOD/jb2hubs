  "description": "Colibacter massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated and characterized from a human stool sample collected in Marseille, France. It belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and the Erysipelotrichia class.\n\nThe cells of Colibacter massiliensis are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and anaerobic. They have a coccoid or ovoid shape and measure approximately 0.5-1.0 Î¼m in diameter.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Colibacter massiliensis is most closely related to other members of the Erysipelotrichaceae family, particularly within the Erysipelatoclostridium genus.\n\nThis bacterial species is considered part of the normal human gut microbiome and has been detected in the fecal samples of both healthy individuals and those with certain gastrointestinal disorders. However, its precise ecological role and potential interactions with the host remain under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the physiological characteristics, metabolic capabilities, and potential clinical relevance of Colibacter massiliensis within the context of the human gut ecosystem.",
