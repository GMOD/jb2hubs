  "description": "Collinsella provencensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Collinsella, which is part of the phylum Actinobacteria. It was first isolated from human fecal samples collected in Provence, France, hence the species name \"provencensis.\"\n\nCollinsella provencensis is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is a member of the human gut microbiome and has been found to be present in relatively low abundance in the intestinal tracts of healthy individuals.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that C. provencensis is closely related to other Collinsella species, such as Collinsella aerofaciens and Collinsella intestinalis, which are also commonly found in the human gut.\n\nThe exact functional roles and potential clinical significance of C. provencensis within the human gut microbiome are still under investigation. As with many gut bacterial species, further research is needed to fully understand its specific metabolic activities, interactions with other gut microbes, and potential implications for human health.",
