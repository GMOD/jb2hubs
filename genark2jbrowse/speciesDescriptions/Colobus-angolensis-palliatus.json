  "description": "Colobus angolensis palliatus, also known as the Angolan black-and-white colobus or the Angola colobus, is a subspecies of the Angolan colobus monkey. It is a medium-sized primate found in the coastal forests of southeastern Kenya and northeastern Tanzania in East Africa.\n\nThe Angolan black-and-white colobus has a distinctive black-and-white coloration, with a long, shaggy black coat on its back and head, and a long, flowing white mantle on its shoulders and sides. It has a short, rounded head and a long, prehensile tail that it uses for balance and support while moving through the trees.\n\nThis subspecies is arboreal, meaning it spends most of its time in the upper canopy of the forest, moving and foraging among the branches. It is primarily folivorous, feeding on a variety of leaves, shoots, and young fruits. The Angolan black-and-white colobus lives in small, multi-male, multi-female social groups and is known for its complex vocalizations and social behaviors.\n\nDue to habitat loss and fragmentation, the Angolan black-and-white colobus is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and conservation efforts are in place to protect this subspecies and its endangered forest habitat.",
