  "description": "Colobus guereza papillomavirus 2 (CgPV2) is a double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Treisdeltapapillomavirus, within the family Papillomaviridae. This virus was identified in the colobus monkey (Colobus guereza), a black-and-white colobus species native to parts of Africa.\n\nCgPV2 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped viruses that infect the epithelial cells of their host species. Papillomaviruses are known to cause various types of benign and malignant lesions, such as warts and cancers, in their respective hosts.\n\nThe genome of CgPV2 is approximately 8,000 base pairs in length and encodes for several genes, including those responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the production of structural proteins. The virus is believed to be transmitted through direct contact or indirect exposure to infected tissues or secretions.\n\nCgPV2 is of interest to researchers as it provides insights into the diversity and evolution of papillomaviruses, particularly those found in non-human primate species. Further study of this virus may contribute to our understanding of the host-virus interactions and the potential for cross-species transmission of papillomaviruses.",
