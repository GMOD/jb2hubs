  "description": "Colobus guereza, commonly known as the eastern black-and-white colobus or Guereza colobus, is a species of Old World monkey native to parts of Africa. It is a member of the colobus monkey genus, Colobus.\n\nThe Colobus guereza is a medium-sized primate, with a distinctive black and white coloration. Its body is covered in long, silky black fur, with a prominent white mantle and tail tuft. This striking appearance serves as a form of aposematic coloration, warning potential predators of its unpalatability.\n\nThese arboreal monkeys are primarily folivorous, feeding on young leaves, shoots, and unripe fruits. They are known for their specialized digestive system, which allows them to efficiently break down the tough, fibrous plant matter they consume.\n\nColobus guereza are highly social animals, living in multi-male, multi-female troops led by a dominant male. They communicate through a range of vocalizations, including loud, resonating calls that can be heard from a distance.\n\nThe species is found in various habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as montane forests and woodlands, across parts of central and eastern Africa. While their population is considered stable, they face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities.",
