  "description": "Coloeus monedula, commonly known as the Eurasian jackdaw, is a small species of crow found across Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Corvidae, which includes other corvid birds such as crows, ravens, and magpies.\n\nThe Eurasian jackdaw is a distinctive bird, with a black plumage and a light gray collar around the back of its neck. It has a relatively small, slender beak and bright blue-gray eyes. Jackdaws are highly social and are often seen in large flocks, particularly during the non-breeding season.\n\nThese birds are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods, including insects, small vertebrates, seeds, and even human-provided food sources. They are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities, often using tools and exhibiting complex social behaviors.\n\nEurasian jackdaws typically nest in cavities, such as tree hollows or buildings, and lay between 3 to 6 eggs. They are known for their adaptability and have been able to thrive in urban and agricultural environments, making them a common sight in many parts of their range.\n\nOverall, the Eurasian jackdaw is a fascinating member of the corvid family, with a unique appearance, behavioral repertoire, and ecological role within its diverse habitats.",
