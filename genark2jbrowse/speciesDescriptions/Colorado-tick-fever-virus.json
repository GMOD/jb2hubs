  "description": "Colorado tick fever virus (CTFV) is a member of the genus Coltivirus, which belongs to the family Reoviridae. It is a double-stranded RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) and is found in the western United States and Canada.\n\nThe virus primarily infects humans, causing a febrile illness known as Colorado tick fever. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and malaise. In some cases, a rash may develop. The incubation period for the virus is typically 3-6 days, and the illness usually resolves within 2-3 weeks.\n\nCTFV is not considered a life-threatening infection, but it can cause significant morbidity, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The virus is primarily maintained in nature through a tick-rodent transmission cycle, with small mammals serving as the primary reservoir hosts.\n\nPrevention of Colorado tick fever involves personal protective measures, such as the use of tick repellents and avoidance of areas with known tick populations. No specific treatment is available, and management of the illness is primarily supportive, focusing on symptom relief and monitoring for any complications.",
