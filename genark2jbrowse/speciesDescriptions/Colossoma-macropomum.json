  "description": "Colossoma macropomum, commonly known as the Pacu or Tambaqui, is a freshwater fish species native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. It is a member of the family Serrasalmidae, which includes piranhas and other related fish.\n\nColossoma macropomum is a large, robust fish that can grow up to 1 meter in length and weigh over 30 kilograms. It has a deep, laterally compressed body with large scales and a distinctive, protruding lower jaw. The fish's coloration ranges from dark gray to olive-green on the back, with silvery or yellowish sides and a white or pale belly.\n\nThe Pacu is an omnivorous fish, feeding on a variety of plant matter, fruits, seeds, and small aquatic invertebrates. It plays an important ecological role in the nutrient cycling and seed dispersal of the Amazon and Orinoco ecosystems.\n\nColossoma macropomum is commercially important for its meat, which is highly valued in South American cuisine. It is also a popular target for recreational anglers and is widely farmed in aquaculture operations. However, the species is threatened by habitat degradation, overfishing, and the introduction of non-native species in its natural range.",
