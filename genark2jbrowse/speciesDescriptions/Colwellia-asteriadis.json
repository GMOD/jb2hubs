  "description": "Colwellia asteriadis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the surface of a starfish (Asterias amurensis) collected from the Sea of Japan. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and psychrophilic (cold-loving) bacterium, meaning it can grow and thrive in cold environments.\n\nThe cells of Colwellia asteriadis are rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to move using polar flagella. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 15Â°C, indicating its adaptation to cold marine environments.\n\nPhylogenetically, Colwellia asteriadis belongs to the genus Colwellia, which is a member of the family Colwelliaceae within the class Gammaproteobacteria. The genus Colwellia is known for its diverse members that are commonly found in cold, marine habitats, such as Arctic and Antarctic regions.\n\nColwellia asteriadis is believed to play a role in the microbial community associated with starfish and may contribute to the overall ecosystem functioning in the cold, marine environments where it is found.",
