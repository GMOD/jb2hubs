  "description": "Compostibacter hankyongensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from compost samples collected in Hankyong, South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Bacilli.\n\nThe cells of Compostibacter hankyongensis are Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and non-spore-forming. They are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen for growth and metabolism. The optimal temperature for growth is around 30Â°C, and the optimal pH range is between 6.5 and 7.5.\n\nCompostibacter hankyongensis is able to degrade a variety of organic compounds, including cellulose, xylan, and pectin, which are commonly found in plant-based materials. This ability to break down complex plant polymers suggests that this bacterium may play a role in the decomposition of organic matter during the composting process.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Compostibacter hankyongensis is most closely related to other bacteria within the genus Compostibacter, which are known to be involved in the degradation of organic matter in compost environments.\n\nFurther research on the metabolic capabilities and ecological functions of Compostibacter hankyongensis may provide insights into the microbial communities involved in the composting of organic waste and the recycling of nutrients in natural ecosystems.",
