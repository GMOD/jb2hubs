  "description": "Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed scientific description of the species Consotaella aegiceratis. This appears to be a relatively obscure or lesser-known species, and without access to scientific references or databases, I do not have the necessary details about its taxonomy, morphology, habitat, behavior, or other key characteristics. \n\nIn general, species descriptions in science typically include information such as the taxonomic classification (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species), a physical description of the organism (size, coloration, distinguishing features), its geographic distribution, ecological niche and habitat preferences, and potentially details about its life cycle, reproduction, or other behaviors. However, without access to reliable sources with information specifically about Consotaella aegiceratis, I cannot confidently provide a comprehensive scientific description of this particular species. My apologies for the limited response, but I do not have enough verified data to give a more detailed account.",
