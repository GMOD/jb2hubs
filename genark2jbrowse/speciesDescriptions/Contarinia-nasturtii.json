  "description": "Contarinia nasturtii, commonly known as the cabbage gall midge, is a species of gall midge that belongs to the family Cecidomyiidae. It is a small dipteran insect that is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America.\n\nThe cabbage gall midge is a significant pest of cruciferous crops, such as cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. The adult females lay their eggs on the leaves or stems of the host plants, and the resulting larvae feed on the plant tissues, causing the formation of galls or swellings on the leaves, stems, or flower buds.\n\nThe larvae of C. nasturtii are small, white, and maggot-like, and they typically spend their entire larval stage within the galls they have created. As the larvae feed, they cause distortion and discoloration of the affected plant parts, which can lead to reduced crop yields and quality.\n\nThe life cycle of the cabbage gall midge typically involves several generations per year, with the adults emerging from the overwintering pupae in the soil and the females laying their eggs on the host plants. The species is known to be responsive to environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, which can influence its population dynamics and the severity of the damage it causes to crops.",
