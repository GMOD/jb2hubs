  "description": "Copidosoma floridanum is a species of parasitic wasp that belongs to the family Encyrtidae. It is a polyembryonic species, meaning that a single egg can develop into multiple genetically identical offspring.\n\nThe adult C. floridanum is a small, dark-colored wasp, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. The female wasp lays her eggs inside the eggs of certain species of lepidopteran (moth or butterfly) hosts, such as the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis).\n\nOnce the host egg hatches, the C. floridanum egg within it undergoes a process of polyembryony, where it divides into numerous embryos, each of which develops into a separate wasp larva. These larvae then feed on the host caterpillar, eventually emerging as adult wasps.\n\nThe polyembryonic nature of C. floridanum is a unique adaptation that allows a single wasp egg to produce a large number of offspring, increasing the chances of successful parasitism and reproduction. This species is of interest to researchers studying the evolution and mechanisms of polyembryony in insects.",
