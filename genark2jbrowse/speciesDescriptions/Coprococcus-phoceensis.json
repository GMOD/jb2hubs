  "description": "Coprococcus phoceensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Coprococcus. It was first isolated from human fecal samples collected in Marseille, France.\n\nThe cells of C. phoceensis are non-spore-forming, non-motile, and typically appear as single cocci or in pairs. They are approximately 0.5-1.0 Î¼m in diameter. This species is considered an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\nBiochemically, C. phoceensis is able to ferment various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, to produce short-chain fatty acids as the main end products of its metabolism. The bacterium is also known to produce acetate, propionate, and butyrate during its fermentative processes.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. phoceensis is classified within the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and family Lachnospiraceae. It is closely related to other members of the genus Coprococcus, which are commonly found in the human gut microbiome and play roles in the maintenance of a healthy intestinal ecosystem.\n\nThe specific ecological function and potential clinical significance of C. phoceensis within the human gut microbiome are still under investigation, as research on this recently described species continues to expand our understanding of the diversity and roles of anaerobic bacteria in the human gut.",
