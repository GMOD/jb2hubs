  "description": "Corbicula fluminea, commonly known as the Asian clam or golden clam, is a species of freshwater bivalve mollusk in the family Cyrenidae. It is native to Asia, but has been introduced to many other parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and South America, where it has become an invasive species.\n\nCorbicula fluminea is a small to medium-sized clam, typically reaching a maximum size of around 4-5 centimeters in diameter. It has a rounded, triangular shell with concentric grooves or ridges on the surface, which can vary in color from yellowish-green to brown or purple. The clam lives buried in the sediment of lakes, rivers, and estuaries, feeding on plankton and detritus suspended in the water.\n\nCorbicula fluminea is known for its high reproductive capacity, with females capable of producing up to 68,000 larvae per spawning event. This, combined with its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, has contributed to its successful invasion and establishment in many non-native habitats. The species can have significant ecological and economic impacts, as it can outcompete native bivalves, alter aquatic food webs, and cause biofouling issues in industrial water systems.",
