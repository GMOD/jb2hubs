The coloration of the fish varies depending on its habitat, ranging from silvery-white to greenish-blue on the back with a lighter underside.\n\nCoregonus lavaretus is an important commercial and recreational fish species, valued for its delicate, white flesh. It primarily feeds on zooplankton, aquatic plants, and small invertebrates. The species spawns in the autumn or early winter, with females depositing their eggs on rocky or gravelly substrates in lakes or rivers.\n\nThe European whitefish is a cold-water species and is sensitive to environmental changes, such as pollution, habitat degradation, and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing in many regions to protect and maintain healthy populations of this ecologically and economically important fish.",
