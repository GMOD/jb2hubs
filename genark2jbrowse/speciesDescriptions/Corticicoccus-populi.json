  "description": "Corticicoccus populi is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Cytophagaceae. It was first isolated from the bark of a poplar tree (Populus sp.) in China. \n\nCorticicoccus populi is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and chemoorganotrophic bacterium. Cells are coccoid to short-rod shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow-pigmented.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Corticicoccus populi is closely related to other members of the genus Corticicoccus, which are known to be associated with plant surfaces and materials. The exact ecological role and functions of this species in the environment are still under investigation.",
