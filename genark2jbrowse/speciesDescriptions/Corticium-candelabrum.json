  "description": "Corticium candelabrum is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a wood-rotting fungus that forms thin, smooth, and waxy fruiting bodies on the surface of decaying wood. The fruiting bodies are typically white or pale cream in color and can have a candlestick-like or branched appearance, which gives the species its common name \"candelabrum.\"\n\nCorticium candelabrum is a saprotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter, in this case, the cellulose and lignin present in the wood. The fungus produces a network of fine, thread-like hyphae that penetrate the wood, secreting enzymes that break down the wood components, allowing the fungus to absorb the released nutrients.\n\nThis species is widely distributed, primarily found in temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it can be observed growing on the decaying wood of various tree species, such as conifers and hardwoods. Corticium candelabrum plays an important role in the decomposition and nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems.",
