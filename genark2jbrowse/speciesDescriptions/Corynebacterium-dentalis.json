  "description": "Corynebacterium dentalis is a species of bacteria that is commonly found in the oral cavity of humans. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium.\n\nCorynebacterium dentalis is considered a commensal bacterium, meaning it can reside in the human body without causing any harm. It is typically found as part of the normal oral microbiome, which is the diverse community of microorganisms that inhabit the human mouth.\n\nThe bacterium is known to be involved in the formation of dental plaque, a sticky film that accumulates on the surface of teeth. While it is not considered a primary pathogen, Corynebacterium dentalis can contribute to the development of dental caries (cavities) and other oral health issues when present in excessive amounts or in combination with other harmful bacteria.\n\nTaxonomically, Corynebacterium dentalis is classified within the phylum Actinobacteria, which includes a group of Gram-positive bacteria known for their diverse metabolic capabilities and roles in various environments, including the human body.",
