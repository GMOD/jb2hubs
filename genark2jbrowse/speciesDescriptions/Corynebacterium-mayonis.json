  "description": "Corynebacterium mayonis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and aerobic bacterium.\n\nCorynebacterium mayonis was first isolated from the blood and bone marrow of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia in France. The species was named after the city of MÃ¢con, where the patient was treated.\n\nPhylogenetically, Corynebacterium mayonis is closely related to other Corynebacterium species, such as Corynebacterium amycolatum and Corynebacterium striatum. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various clinical conditions, including bacteremia, endocarditis, and wound infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe bacterium is characterized by its ability to grow on standard microbiological media and its biochemical properties, such as the presence of catalase and the production of acid from glucose and sucrose. Molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, are often used for its accurate identification and differentiation from other Corynebacterium species.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinical significance of Corynebacterium mayonis in human health and disease.",
