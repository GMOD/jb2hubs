  "description": "Corynebacterium renale is a species of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is found primarily in the urinary tract of animals, particularly in ruminants such as cattle and sheep.\n\nCorynebacterium renale is known to be one of the causative agents of pyelonephritis, a type of urinary tract infection that can lead to inflammation of the kidneys. This bacterium is able to adhere to the epithelial cells lining the urinary tract, allowing it to colonize and cause disease.\n\nPhenotypically, Corynebacterium renale is a catalase-positive, nitrate-reducing bacterium that can utilize a variety of carbohydrates for energy production. It is also known to produce propionic acid as a metabolic byproduct.\n\nGenetically, Corynebacterium renale has a circular chromosome with a GC content of approximately 55-57%. The genome size is estimated to be around 2.5-3.0 Mb, reflecting its relatively small size compared to other bacterial species.\n\nOverall, Corynebacterium renale is an important veterinary pathogen that can cause significant economic losses in livestock production due to its ability to cause urinary tract infections and associated complications.",
