  "description": "Corynebacterium spheniscorum is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the skin and feathers of penguins (Spheniscidae) in Antarctica. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium.\n\nCorynebacterium spheniscorum is a psychrotolerant (cold-loving) bacterium, meaning it can grow and thrive in cold environments, such as the habitats of penguins in the Antarctic region. It is able to adapt to the low temperatures and harsh environmental conditions found in these polar ecosystems.\n\nPhylogenetically, Corynebacterium spheniscorum is closely related to other Corynebacterium species, but it is distinguished by its unique phenotypic and genetic characteristics. It has been studied for its potential role in the skin and feather microbiome of penguins, as well as its potential applications in biotechnology and environmental research in cold regions.",
