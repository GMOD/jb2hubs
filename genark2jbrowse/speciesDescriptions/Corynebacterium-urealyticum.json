  "description": "Corynebacterium urealyticum is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, pleomorphic bacterium that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is a facultative anaerobic microorganism, which means it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen.\n\nThe distinctive feature of C. urealyticum is its ability to hydrolyze urea, which is the basis for its name. This property allows the bacterium to produce ammonia, leading to an increase in the pH of its surrounding environment, making it alkaliphilic.\n\nC. urealyticum is commonly found as a commensal organism on the skin and mucous membranes of humans, particularly in the urinary tract. However, it can also be an opportunistic pathogen, causing various infections, such as urinary tract infections, bacteremia, and endocarditis, especially in immunocompromised individuals or patients with underlying medical conditions.\n\nThe identification of C. urealyticum typically involves microbiological culturing, biochemical tests, and molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Due to its ability to cause antibiotic-resistant infections, the management of C. urealyticum infections often requires a combination of antimicrobial therapy and appropriate infection control measures.",
