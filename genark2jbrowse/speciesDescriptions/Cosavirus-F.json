  "description": "Cosavirus F is a species of virus that belongs to the Cosavirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. Picornaviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nCosavirus F is a member of the Cosavirus genus, which is a relatively newly discovered group of picornaviruses. Cosamiruses are known to infect various mammalian hosts, including humans, non-human primates, and rodents.\n\nThe genome of Cosavirus F consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes for a polyprotein, which is then proteolytically cleaved into the structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nLimited information is available about the specific biological characteristics, host range, and potential pathogenicity of Cosavirus F, as it is a newly discovered virus species and further research is needed to fully understand its properties and impact.",
