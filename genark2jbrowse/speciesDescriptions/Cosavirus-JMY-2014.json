  "description": "Cosavirus JMY-2014 is a virus species that belongs to the genus Cosavirus, which is part of the family Picornaviridae. Picornaviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nCosavirus JMY-2014 was first identified in 2014 from a stool sample collected in Japan. It is a member of the Cosavirus genus, which is a relatively newly discovered group of picornaviruses that have been detected in the fecal samples of humans and other mammals.\n\nThe genome of Cosavirus JMY-2014 is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the various structural and non-structural proteins required for viral replication and assembly.\n\nLimited information is available about the biology, epidemiology, and potential pathogenicity of Cosavirus JMY-2014, as it is an understudied virus. Further research is needed to better understand the distribution, host range, and potential health implications associated with this newly discovered cosavirus species.",
