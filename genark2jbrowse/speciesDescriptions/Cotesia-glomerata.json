  "description": "Cotesia glomerata is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is a widely distributed insect, found in various parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nCotesia glomerata is a small wasp, measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. It has a slender body, antennae, and a pair of delicate wings. The wasp's coloration is typically black or dark brown, with yellowish or whitish markings on the abdomen and legs.\n\nThe life cycle of Cotesia glomerata involves a unique parasitic relationship with its host, the larvae of the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae). The female wasp lays its eggs inside the caterpillar of the cabbage white butterfly. The wasp larvae then develop within the host, feeding on the caterpillar's tissues. Eventually, the wasp larvae emerge from the host, forming a characteristic cluster or \"glomerate\" of cocoons on the exterior of the caterpillar.\n\nCotesia glomerata is an important biological control agent, as it helps regulate the population of the cabbage white butterfly, which can be a significant agricultural pest. The wasp's parasitism of the caterpillar larvae disrupts the butterfly's life cycle and reduces the damage it can cause to crops, such as cabbage, broccoli, and other brassica plants.\n\nThis species of parasitoid wasp is studied extensively in the field of insect ecology and biological control, as it provides a valuable model for understanding host-parasite interactions and the potential applications of natural enemies in sustainable pest management strategies.",
