  "description": "Cowpox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects rodents, particularly bank voles and wood mice, as its natural reservoir. Cowpox virus can also infect various other mammalian species, including humans, through zoonotic transmission.\n\nThe cowpox virus genome is approximately 220 kilobase pairs in size and encodes around 200 genes. The virus is characterized by its ability to produce distinctive skin lesions, typically circular in shape, with a central red area surrounded by a raised, red border. In humans, cowpox infection can result in a localized skin rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy.\n\nCowpox virus is closely related to, but distinct from, the more well-known variola virus, which is the causative agent of smallpox. While cowpox infections in humans are generally milder and less severe than smallpox, the virus can still pose a significant health risk, particularly to individuals with compromised immune systems or those who have not been vaccinated against smallpox.",
