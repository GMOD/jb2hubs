  "description": "Coxiella burnetii RSA 493 is a strain of the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, which is the causative agent of the zoonotic disease Q fever. Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen, meaning it can only replicate within the host cells of its animal or human hosts.\n\nThe RSA 493 strain was originally isolated from a human patient with Q fever in the United States. It is commonly used in research and laboratory settings as a model strain for studying the biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of C. burnetii.\n\nCoxiella burnetii is a small, pleomorphic, Gram-negative bacterium that exhibits a unique biphasic life cycle. It can exist in both a small cell variant (SCV) and a large cell variant (LCV) form, with the SCV being the infectious and environmentally stable form. The bacterium is highly resistant to environmental stressors and can survive for extended periods outside of a host.\n\nInfection with C. burnetii RSA 493 can lead to the development of Q fever, a flu-like illness that can progress to more severe forms, such as pneumonia, hepatitis, and endocarditis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The strain is considered a potential bioterrorism agent due to its high infectivity and environmental stability.",
