  "description": "Coxiella endosymbiont of Dermacentor marginatus is a bacterial species that lives in a symbiotic relationship with the tick Dermacentor marginatus. Dermacentor marginatus is a hard tick species commonly found in Europe and Asia.\n\nThe Coxiella endosymbiont is an intracellular bacteria, meaning it resides within the cells of the tick host. It is considered an obligate endosymbiont, as the tick cannot survive and reproduce without the presence of this bacteria.\n\nThe Coxiella endosymbiont is vertically transmitted, passing from female ticks to their offspring through the eggs. This ensures the continuous presence of the bacteria within the tick population.\n\nFunctionally, the Coxiella endosymbiont is believed to play a role in the tick's nutritional metabolism, providing essential nutrients and metabolites that the tick cannot synthesize on its own. This mutualistic relationship benefits both the bacteria and the tick host.\n\nInterestingly, Coxiella-like endosymbionts have been found in various tick species, suggesting that this type of symbiosis is widespread among ticks. The study of these endosymbionts can provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations and ecological interactions between ticks and their associated microbiome.",
