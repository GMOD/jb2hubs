  "description": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects humans.\n\nCVB3 is a non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is approximately 7.4 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nCVB3 is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and it can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including myocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, and pancreatitis. The virus is known to have a tropism for cardiac and skeletal muscle cells, as well as pancreatic cells, which can lead to the development of these disease conditions.\n\nInfection with CVB3 can occur in both children and adults, and it is considered an important causative agent of viral myocarditis, which can potentially progress to dilated cardiomyopathy. The virus's ability to evade the host's immune response and its potential for genetic variation contribute to its ability to cause significant public health concerns.",
