  "description": "Craseonycteris thonglongyai, commonly known as the bumblebee bat or Kitti's hog-nosed bat, is the world's smallest known species of mammal. It is a member of the family Craseonycteridae and is endemic to Thailand.\n\nDescription:\n- Extremely small in size, with a body length of only 2-2.5 inches (5-6 cm) and a weight of just 2-2.5 grams (0.07-0.09 ounces).\n- Has a distinctive, elongated, pig-like snout and large, rounded ears.\n- Fur coloration ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-brown on the back, with a lighter underside.\n- Wings are small and delicate, with a wingspan of approximately 6-8 inches (15-20 cm).\n- Feeds primarily on insects, especially mosquitoes and other small flying insects, using echolocation to locate and capture its prey.\n- Lives in small colonies, often roosting in limestone caves or crevices, sometimes in close proximity to other bat species.\n- Classified as 'Vulnerable' by the IUCN due to its small geographic range and threats such as habitat loss and disturbance of roosting sites.\n\nThis remarkable species is considered one of the smallest and most unique mammals on Earth, and its conservation is crucial for maintaining the biodiversity of its native Thai ecosystems.",
