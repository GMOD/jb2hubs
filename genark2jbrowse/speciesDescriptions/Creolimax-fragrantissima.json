It is found in certain regions of Europe, primarily in Germany and neighboring countries.\n\nThis snail species is characterized by its small size, typically reaching a shell height of around 2-3 millimeters. The shell is conical in shape, with a smooth surface and a pointed apex. The color of the shell can vary from light brown to greenish-brown.\n\nCreolimax fragrantissima inhabits slow-moving or stagnant freshwater bodies, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-flowing streams. It is often found living among aquatic vegetation or on submerged rocks and debris.\n\nThe species is known for its ability to produce a distinctive, fragrant odor, which is the origin of its specific epithet \"fragrantissima.\" This odor is believed to be a defense mechanism against potential predators.\n\nCreolimax fragrantissima is an important component of freshwater ecosystems, playing a role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the habitats it occupies.",
