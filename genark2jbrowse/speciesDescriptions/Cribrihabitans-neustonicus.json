  "description": "Cribrihabitans neustonicus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Cribrihabitans neustonicus is known to be a member of the neuston, which is the community of organisms that live at the air-water interface, such as the surface microlayer of aquatic environments.\n\nThis species was first isolated from the surface microlayer of a freshwater lake. It is capable of growing under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, demonstrating its versatility in adapting to different oxygen levels in its habitat. Cribrihabitans neustonicus is also known to be able to degrade various organic compounds, suggesting its potential role in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance and specific metabolic capabilities of Cribrihabitans neustonicus within the neuston community and its broader impacts on aquatic ecosystems.",
