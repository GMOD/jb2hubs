  "description": "Cribrihabitans pelagius is a species of marine bacterium that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a heterotrophic, aerobic, and Gram-negative bacterium.\n\nCribrihabitans pelagius is found in the pelagic zone of the ocean, which is the open water column away from the coastlines and seafloor. It is capable of surviving and thriving in the oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) conditions of the open ocean.\n\nThe cells of Cribrihabitans pelagius are typically rod-shaped and can form aggregates or clusters. They possess a distinctive cell envelope structure with a characteristic \"cribriform\" (sieve-like) outer membrane, which likely plays a role in nutrient acquisition and transport.\n\nGenomic analysis has revealed that Cribrihabitans pelagius has adaptations that enable it to efficiently utilize various organic compounds, including carbohydrates and proteins, as sources of carbon and energy. This metabolic versatility likely contributes to its success in the oligotrophic pelagic environment.\n\nOverall, Cribrihabitans pelagius is an ecologically important member of the marine microbial community, playing a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the open ocean ecosystem.",
