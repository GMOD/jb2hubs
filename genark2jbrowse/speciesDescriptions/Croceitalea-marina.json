  "description": "Croceitalea marina is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Croceitalea marina was isolated from seawater collected from the East China Sea.\n\nThe cells of Croceitalea marina are rod-shaped and exhibit a yellow pigmentation. They are motile and have a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 25-30°C and a pH range of 7.0-8.0.\n\nCroceitalea marina is capable of hydrolyzing starch, gelatin, and Tween 80, but it cannot reduce nitrate or produce indole. The major fatty acids present in the cell membrane of this species are iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, and C16:1ω7c.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data has shown that Croceitalea marina is closely related to other members of the genus Croceitalea, which are known to be isolated from various marine environments.",
