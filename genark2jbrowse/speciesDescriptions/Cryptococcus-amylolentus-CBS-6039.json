  "description": "Cryptococcus amylolentus CBS 6039 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Cryptococcus. It is a basidiomycetous yeast, meaning it is part of the phylum Basidiomycota, which includes mushrooms, puffballs, and other fungi.\n\nThe species Cryptococcus amylolentus was first isolated from soil samples and described in 1986. The strain CBS 6039 is the type strain for this species, meaning it serves as the reference specimen for the species identification.\n\nCryptococcus amylolentus is known to be capable of producing amylase, an enzyme that can break down starch. This ability to hydrolyze starch is reflected in the species name \"amylolentus,\" which means \"slow starch-degrading\" in Latin.\n\nCells of Cryptococcus amylolentus are typically spherical to oval in shape and reproduce asexually through budding. The species is considered to be psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow and thrive in relatively low-temperature environments.\n\nOverall, Cryptococcus amylolentus CBS 6039 is a yeast species that has been isolated from soil and is characterized by its ability to degrade starch, as well as its tolerance to colder temperatures.",
