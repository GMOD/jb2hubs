  "description": "Cryptococcus gattii NT-10 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the Cryptococcus genus. It is primarily known for its ability to cause cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection that can affect both humans and animals.\n\nCryptococcus gattii NT-10 is a basidiomycetous yeast that is typically found in the environment, particularly in soil and decaying wood. It is distinct from the more common Cryptococcus neoformans species, which is the primary cause of cryptococcosis in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nUnlike Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus gattii NT-10 is primarily associated with infections in immunocompetent individuals and can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including pulmonary cryptococcosis, meningoencephalitis, and disseminated disease.\n\nThe NT-10 designation refers to a specific molecular type or genotype within the Cryptococcus gattii species complex. This genotype has been observed in various geographic regions and has been linked to certain epidemiological and clinical features.\n\nCryptococcus gattii NT-10 is known to have a unique ecological niche and may exhibit different virulence factors and host interactions compared to other Cryptococcus gattii genotypes. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of this specific strain is an area of ongoing research in the field of medical mycology.",
