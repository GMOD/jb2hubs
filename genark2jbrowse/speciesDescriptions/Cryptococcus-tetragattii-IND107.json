It is a basidiomycetous fungus that is primarily found in the environment, particularly in soil and avian excreta. Cryptococcus tetragattii is a member of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, which includes several species that are known to cause cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection in humans and animals.\n\nThe strain IND107 was isolated from environmental samples collected in India. It is known to have specific genetic and phenotypic characteristics that distinguish it from other Cryptococcus tetragattii strains. The strain IND107 has been the subject of scientific research to better understand its ecology, epidemiology, and potential pathogenic properties, as part of the broader investigation of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex.",
