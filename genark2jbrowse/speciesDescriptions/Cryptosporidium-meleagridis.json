  "description": "Cryptosporidium meleagridis is a species of parasitic protozoan that belongs to the Apicomplexa phylum. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, livestock, and wildlife.\n\nCryptosporidium meleagridis is primarily found in domestic and wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), which serve as the natural host for this parasite. However, it can also infect other avian species, as well as mammals, including cattle, sheep, and humans.\n\nThe life cycle of Cryptosporidium meleagridis involves the production of environmentally resistant oocysts, which are the infective stage of the parasite. These oocysts are shed in the feces of infected hosts and can contaminate water sources, food, or other environmental surfaces. When ingested by a susceptible host, the oocysts excyst and release sporozoites that invade the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to the development of cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal illness.\n\nCryptosporidium meleagridis is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen, as it has been increasingly associated with human cryptosporidiosis cases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The parasite is also of concern in the poultry industry due to its potential to cause economic losses and production challenges.\n\nResearch on Cryptosporidium meleagridis is ongoing, as scientists continue to investigate its epidemiology, host specificity, and potential for transmission to humans and other animal species, with the goal of developing effective prevention and control strategies.",
