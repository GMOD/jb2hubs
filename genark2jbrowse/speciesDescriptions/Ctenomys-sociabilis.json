  "description": "Ctenomys sociabilis, commonly known as the social tuco-tuco, is a species of rodent found in Argentina. It is a member of the genus Ctenomys, which comprises a group of subterranean rodents known as tuco-tucos.\n\nThe social tuco-tuco is characterized by its compact, stocky build and short, dense fur that ranges in color from grayish to reddish-brown. It has a large head, small eyes, and short, rounded ears, adaptations to its subterranean lifestyle. The species is known for its social behavior, living in complex burrow systems with multiple individuals, unlike many other tuco-tuco species that are more solitary.\n\nCtenomys sociabilis is a herbivorous rodent, feeding on various plant materials found underground, such as roots, tubers, and rhizomes. It is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem, playing a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the subterranean environment.\n\nThe social tuco-tuco is an endemic species, with a restricted distribution in the Patagonian region of Argentina. It is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human activities, such as agriculture and urbanization.",
