  "description": "Cuculus canorus, commonly known as the common cuckoo, is a species of cuckoo bird found across Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa. It is a migratory bird, spending the breeding season in temperate regions and the non-breeding season in warmer areas.\n\nThe common cuckoo is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring around 32-34 cm in length and weighing between 100-150 grams. It has a slender, streamlined body, a relatively long, slightly hooked bill, and a long, rounded tail. The adult plumage is predominantly grey on the upper parts and white with dark barring on the underparts.\n\nThe common cuckoo is known for its distinctive, resonant \"cuckoo\" call, which is often associated with the arrival of spring in its breeding range. This species is a brood parasite, meaning it lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, leaving the host parents to incubate and raise the cuckoo chick.\n\nThe common cuckoo's diet consists primarily of insects, such as caterpillars, moths, and flies, which it typically captures in flight or by gleaning from vegetation. It plays an important ecological role as a natural pest control agent, contributing to the regulation of insect populations.\n\nThe common cuckoo is a widespread and relatively common species, with a stable global population. However, some local populations have experienced declines due to factors such as habitat loss, climate change, and changes in agricultural practices.",
