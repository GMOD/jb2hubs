  "description": "Cupriavidus laharis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Cupriavidus. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium. Cupriavidus laharis is known to be capable of tolerating and thriving in environments with high concentrations of copper, a trait that has led to its identification and classification.\n\nThis bacterium was first isolated from soil samples collected near a copper mine in the Lahars region of Indonesia. Its ability to withstand and grow in the presence of elevated copper levels makes it a subject of interest for potential applications in bioremediation and metal recovery processes.\n\nCupriavidus laharis is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for its metabolic processes. It is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, contributing to its adaptability to different environmental conditions.\n\nFurther research on the physiological, genomic, and ecological characteristics of Cupriavidus laharis may provide insights into its mechanisms of copper tolerance, potential biotechnological applications, and its role in copper-rich natural or industrial environments.",
