  "description": "Cupriavidus yeoncheonensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Yeoncheon, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Cupriavidus.\n\nThe cells of C. yeoncheonensis are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.3-2.5 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. yeoncheonensis is closely related to other species within the genus Cupriavidus, which are known for their ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. This trait may contribute to the survival and adaptation of C. yeoncheonensis in soil environments with potential heavy metal contamination.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological and metabolic characteristics of C. yeoncheonensis may provide insights into its ecological role and potential applications in bioremediation or other biotechnological processes.",
