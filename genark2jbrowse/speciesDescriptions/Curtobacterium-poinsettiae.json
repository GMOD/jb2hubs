  "description": "Curtobacterium poinsettiae is a species of gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the genus Curtobacterium. It was first isolated from the leaves of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) plants.\n\nThe cells of C. poinsettiae are coryneform, meaning they have a characteristic club-shaped or irregular rod-like morphology. They are typically 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are yellow-pigmented, smooth, and convex.\n\nBiochemically, C. poinsettiae is able to hydrolyze starch and esculin, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. poinsettiae is closely related to other Curtobacterium species, and it is classified within the family Microbacteriaceae. This bacterium has been reported to be associated with the normal microbiome of poinsettia plants, and it may play a role in plant health and disease resistance.",
