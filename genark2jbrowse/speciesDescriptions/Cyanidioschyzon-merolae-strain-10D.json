  "description": "Cyanidioschyzon merolae strain 10D is a unicellular red alga that belongs to the phylum Cyanidiophyceae. It is a thermoacidophilic organism, meaning it thrives in high-temperature and low-pH environments, typically found in volcanic hot springs and geothermal areas.\n\nThis strain, 10D, was isolated from a hot spring in Japan and has become a model organism for the study of various cellular processes in eukaryotic extremophiles. C. merolae strain 10D has a small genome size, compact cellular organization, and a simple life cycle, making it a valuable model for genomic, cell biological, and evolutionary studies.\n\nThe cells of C. merolae strain 10D are spherical, typically ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 micrometers in diameter. They possess a single mitochondrion, a single chloroplast, and a simple internal membrane system, which allows for the efficient study of organelle structure and function.\n\nThis species is of interest to researchers due to its unique adaptations to extreme environments, its potential for biofuel production, and its evolutionary significance as an early-diverging eukaryote. The availability of the complete genome sequence and various genetic and molecular tools have further enhanced the utility of C. merolae strain 10D as a model organism in the fields of cell biology, evolutionary biology, and biotechnology.",
