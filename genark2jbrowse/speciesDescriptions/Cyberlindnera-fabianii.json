  "description": "Cyberlindnera fabianii is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, and order Saccharomycetales. It is a single-celled, eukaryotic microorganism that is commonly found in various natural environments, such as soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of animals.\n\nCyberlindnera fabianii is known for its ability to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, and produce ethanol as a byproduct. This characteristic makes it a potentially useful species in the production of biofuels and other industrial applications.\n\nThe cells of Cyberlindnera fabianii are typically oval or spherical in shape, and they reproduce asexually through budding. The species is considered to be relatively slow-growing compared to other yeast species, but it is generally considered to be safe and non-pathogenic to humans and other organisms.\n\nOverall, Cyberlindnera fabianii is a versatile and industrially relevant yeast species that has potential applications in various biotechnological processes.",
