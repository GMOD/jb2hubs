  "description": "Cyclobacterium lianum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. The cells of C. lianum are typically circular or ring-shaped, with a diameter ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 micrometers (μm).\n\nC. lianum was first isolated from a sediment sample collected from the Lian River in China. It is considered a mesophilic bacterium, capable of growing at temperatures between 15°C and 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The bacterium is also capable of tolerating moderate levels of salinity, with the ability to grow in the presence of up to 3% (w/v) sodium chloride.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. lianum is closely related to other members of the genus Cyclobacterium, which are commonly found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and marine habitats.\n\nThe specific ecological roles and metabolic capabilities of C. lianum are not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential functions and interactions within its natural environment.",
