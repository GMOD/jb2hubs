  "description": "Cyclovirus NG14 is a species of single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Cyclovirus, family Circoviridae. It was first identified in a fecal sample collected from a chimpanzee in Cameroon, West Africa.\n\nThe genome of Cyclovirus NG14 is circular and approximately 2.3 kilobases in size. It encodes two main proteins: a replication-associated protein (Rep) and a capsid protein (Cap). The Rep protein is responsible for the replication of the viral genome, while the Cap protein forms the viral capsid, which is the protective protein shell surrounding the viral genetic material.\n\nCyclovirus NG14 is closely related to other Cyclovirus species that have been discovered in various animal species, including mammals, birds, and insects. The virus is believed to have a wide host range and may infect a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, although its exact host specificity and potential pathogenicity are not yet fully understood.\n\nThe discovery of Cyclovirus NG14 and other Cyclovirus species has contributed to our understanding of the diversity and evolution of small circular DNA viruses, which play important roles in various ecosystems and can have implications for human and animal health.",
