  "description": "Cyclovirus TN25 is a species of virus belonging to the family Cycloviridae. It is a small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 2 kilobases.\n\nCyclovirus TN25 was first discovered in 2011 in a stool sample collected from a human patient in Tunisia. Since then, it has been detected in various environmental and clinical samples, including human feces, sewage, and animal tissues, suggesting a widespread distribution.\n\nThe genome of Cyclovirus TN25 encodes two major open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to encode proteins involved in viral replication and capsid formation. However, the specific functions of these proteins and the overall biology of this virus are not yet fully understood.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses have shown that Cyclovirus TN25 is closely related to other members of the Cycloviridae family, which are known to infect a diverse range of host organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, and even plants.\n\nThe potential impact of Cyclovirus TN25 on human or animal health is currently unknown, as its specific host range, tropism, and pathogenic potential have not been extensively studied. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, ecology, and potential clinical significance of this recently discovered viral species.",
