  "description": "Cyclovirus VN is a species of small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Cycloviridae. This virus was first identified in 2012 from fecal samples collected in Vietnam.\n\nThe genome of Cyclovirus VN is approximately 2 kilobases in size and encodes two major open reading frames (ORFs) that are oriented in opposite directions. These ORFs are predicted to encode proteins involved in viral replication and structural components.\n\nCyclovirus VN is classified as a member of the genus Cyclovirus, which includes several other closely related viruses found in various animal species, including humans, chimpanzees, and bats. The exact host range and potential pathogenicity of Cyclovirus VN are still under investigation, as the virus has been detected in both healthy and diseased individuals.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecology, epidemiology, and potential clinical significance of Cyclovirus VN and other members of the Cycloviridae family.",
