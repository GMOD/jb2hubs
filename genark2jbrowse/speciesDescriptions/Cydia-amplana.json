  "description": "Cydia amplana is a species of moth belonging to the family Tortricidae, commonly known as the codling moth. It is a small, grayish-brown moth with a wingspan of around 15-20 millimeters.\n\nThe larvae of Cydia amplana are pests that feed on the fruits of various tree species, including apples, pears, and other pomaceous fruits. The larvae bore into the fruit, causing damage and making the fruit unmarketable. This species is considered a significant agricultural pest in many parts of the world where its host plants are grown.\n\nThe life cycle of Cydia amplana typically involves the adult moths laying eggs on the surface of the host plant's fruit. The larvae then hatch and burrow into the fruit, feeding on the pulp and seeds. Pupation occurs within the damaged fruit or in the soil, and the adult moths emerge to continue the cycle.\n\nEffective management of Cydia amplana often involves integrated pest management strategies, such as the use of pheromone traps, biological control agents, and the application of targeted insecticides to reduce the population and minimize crop damage.",
