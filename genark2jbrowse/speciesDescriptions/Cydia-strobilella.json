  "description": "Cydia strobilella, commonly known as the spruce cone moth or spruce bud moth, is a species of moth in the family Tortricidae. It is a small moth, with a wingspan of approximately 12-15 millimeters.\n\nThe moth's forewings are greyish-brown in color, often with darker patches or striations. The hindwings are greyish-white. The larvae, or caterpillars, of Cydia strobilella are typically pale yellow or greenish in color, with a dark head capsule.\n\nThe spruce cone moth is found in regions where spruce trees (Picea spp.) are native, including Europe, Asia, and North America. The larvae of this species feed on the developing cones and buds of spruce trees, often causing damage to the trees' reproductive structures.\n\nCydia strobilella plays an important ecological role as a natural regulator of spruce tree populations, but it can also be considered a pest species in managed forestry operations where the health of spruce trees is a priority. Understanding the biology and life cycle of this moth species is important for developing effective management strategies in areas where it may cause economic or ecological harm.",
