  "description": "Cynoglossus semilaevis, commonly known as the large-toothed tonguefish or Chinese tongue sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Cynoglossidae. It is native to the coastal waters of the western Pacific Ocean, primarily found in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.\n\nCynoglossus semilaevis is a bottom-dwelling fish that lives in sandy or muddy habitats at depths ranging from 10 to 200 meters. It has a dorsoventrally flattened body, with both eyes situated on the left side of the head. The fish's body is brown or grayish-brown in color, and it has a distinctive large mouth with numerous small teeth.\n\nThe species is known for its unique reproductive strategy, which involves a sex-changing process. Cynoglossus semilaevis is a protandrous hermaphrodite, meaning that individuals start their lives as males and later undergo a sex change to become females. This process is believed to be an adaptation to the species' environment and population dynamics.\n\nCynoglossus semilaevis is an important commercial fish species in East Asia, particularly in China, where it is widely consumed and economically significant. The species is harvested through commercial fishing and is also farmed in aquaculture operations.",
