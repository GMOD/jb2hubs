  "description": "Cynopterus sphinx, commonly known as the Greater Short-nosed Fruit Bat, is a species of bat found in South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Pteropodidae, which includes the fruit-eating bats.\n\nThe Cynopterus sphinx is a medium-sized bat, with a wingspan ranging from 60 to 80 centimeters. It has a short, rounded muzzle and large, rounded ears. The fur is generally brown or reddish-brown in color, with a paler underside. These bats are known to be excellent flyers, capable of making agile maneuvers while foraging for their preferred food, which includes various fruits, flowers, and nectar.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across its range, which includes India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of Indonesia. They typically roost in tree cavities, crevices, or human-made structures, such as buildings or bridges.\n\nCynopterus sphinx plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator and seed disperser, contributing to the regeneration of various plant species. However, their populations have faced threats from habitat loss and hunting in some regions, leading to their classification as a Least Concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
