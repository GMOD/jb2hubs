  "description": "Cyphellophora attinorum is a species of fungus that belongs to the order Chaetothyriales. It is a black yeast-like fungus that was isolated from the cuticle of leaf-cutting ants (Attini) in Brazil.\n\nThe main characteristics of Cyphellophora attinorum are:\n\n1. Colony morphology: Colonies on agar media are dark brown to black, velvety, and often have a wrinkled or folded appearance.\n\n2. Cell morphology: The fungal cells are yeast-like, typically round to oval in shape, and range in size from 3-8 Î¼m in diameter. They reproduce by budding.\n\n3. Reproductive structures: Cyphellophora attinorum produces arthroconidia, which are chains of dry, easily dispersed spores that are formed by the fragmentation of hyphae.\n\n4. Habitat and ecology: This fungus is found associated with the cuticle of leaf-cutting ants (Attini), suggesting a potential symbiotic or commensal relationship with the insects. It is believed to be adapted to the specialized niche provided by the ant cuticle.\n\n5. Phylogenetic relationships: Genetic analysis has placed Cyphellophora attinorum within the order Chaetothyriales, which includes other black yeast-like fungi that are often associated with insects or other specialized niches.\n\nOverall, Cyphellophora attinorum is a unique black yeast-like fungus that has adapted to thrive in the specialized microhabitat provided by the cuticle of leaf-cutting ants in South America.",
