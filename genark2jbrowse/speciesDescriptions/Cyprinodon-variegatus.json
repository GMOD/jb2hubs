  "description": "Cyprinodon variegatus, commonly known as the sheepshead minnow, is a small freshwater and brackish water fish species belonging to the family Cyprinodontidae. It is native to the coastal regions of the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Massachusetts to Mexico, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe sheepshead minnow is a small, laterally compressed fish with a rounded, blunt head and a small, terminal mouth. Its coloration is variable, ranging from olive-green to brown on the back, with a lighter, silvery-white belly. The fish may also display distinctive vertical bars or spots along its sides.\n\nCyprinodon variegatus is known for its tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, including varying salinity levels, temperatures, and dissolved oxygen concentrations. This adaptability allows the species to thrive in a variety of habitats, including estuaries, tidal marshes, lagoons, and even isolated inland ponds and lakes.\n\nThe sheepshead minnow plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife. Additionally, it is commonly used as a research organism in toxicology studies and as a model species for understanding environmental and genetic factors that influence fish development and survival.",
