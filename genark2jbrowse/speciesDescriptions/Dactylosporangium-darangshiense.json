  "description": "Dactylosporangium darangshiense is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil collected in Darangshi, South Korea. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells are filamentous and branched, with a diameter of approximately 0.5-0.8 μm. The bacterium is capable of producing dactylospores, which are specialized reproductive structures that resemble fingers or digits. The optimal growth conditions for D. darangshiense include a temperature range of 25-30°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that D. darangshiense is closely related to other members of the genus Dactylosporangium, which are known for their ability to produce diverse secondary metabolites with potential pharmaceutical applications.",
