  "description": "Dactylosporangium maewongense is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil collected in Mae Wong National Park, Thailand. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells are filamentous and exhibit a branching, mycelial growth pattern. \n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicates that D. maewongense belongs to the genus Dactylosporangium, which is a member of the family Micromonosporaceae. The genus Dactylosporangium is characterized by the production of spherical to ellipsoidal sporangia containing motile spores.\n\nD. maewongense can grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C. It is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth. Chemotaxonomic analysis has revealed the presence of LL-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall, which is a characteristic feature of the Micromonosporaceae family.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological, biochemical, and genomic properties of D. maewongense may provide insights into its ecological role and potential biotechnological applications.",
