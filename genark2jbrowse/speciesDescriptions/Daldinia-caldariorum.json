  "description": "Daldinia caldariorum is a species of ascomycete fungus that belongs to the family Hypoxylaceae. It is commonly known as the \"charcoal fungus\" or the \"coal fungus\" due to its distinctive charcoal-like appearance and growth on burned or charred wood.\n\nDaldinia caldariorum is characterized by its spherical to oblong, black, hard, and woody fruiting bodies (stromata) that can reach up to 5 cm in diameter. The interior of the stromata is zonate, with alternating layers of dark and light tissue, which gives it a distinctive banded appearance when cut in cross-section.\n\nThe fungus reproduces through the production of small, brown, elliptical ascospores, which are discharged from the asci (spore-bearing structures) within the stromata. These ascospores are dispersed by wind and can initiate new colonies on suitable substrates, such as decaying or burned wood.\n\nDaldinia caldariorum is widely distributed and can be found in various regions around the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical environments. It plays an important role in the decomposition of woody plant material, contributing to the cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems.",
