  "description": "Dalotia coriaria is a species of rove beetle (family Staphylinidae) that is commonly known as the fungus-feeding rove beetle. It is a small insect, typically measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length.\n\nDalotia coriaria is found in various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia. It is commonly associated with decomposing organic matter, such as decaying wood, leaf litter, and fungal growths. As the name suggests, the species feeds primarily on fungal spores and hyphae, playing a role in the decomposition of organic materials.\n\nThe beetles have elongated, slender bodies and are typically brown or reddish-brown in color. They possess short, segmented antennae and small, compound eyes. Dalotia coriaria is known for its ability to quickly scurry and hide when disturbed, utilizing its agility and small size to evade potential predators.\n\nThese rove beetles are considered ecologically important as they contribute to the decomposition and nutrient cycling processes in various terrestrial ecosystems. Their presence can be an indicator of a healthy, balanced environment with an abundance of decomposing organic matter and fungal growth.",
