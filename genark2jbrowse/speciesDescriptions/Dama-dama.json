  "description": "Dama dama, commonly known as the fallow deer, is a medium-sized species of deer native to western Eurasia. It is a member of the family Cervidae and the genus Dama.\n\nFallow deer have a distinct spotted coat pattern that can vary in color from reddish-brown to nearly white. They have distinctive broad, palmate antlers that are typically present in males (bucks) but absent in females (does). The antlers are shed and regrown annually.\n\nThese deer are known for their social behavior, often living in herds and grazing on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, herbs, and browse. They are adaptable to a range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and open areas.\n\nFallow deer have a gestation period of around 8 months and typically give birth to a single fawn. They are considered a conservation-dependent species, with some populations managed and protected in various regions.",
