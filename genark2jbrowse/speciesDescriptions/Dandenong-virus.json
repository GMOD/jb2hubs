  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called the \"Dandenong virus.\" This appears to be a made-up or fictional virus name, as I could not find any credible scientific information about a virus by this name.\n\nViruses are microscopic infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms, such as animals, plants, or bacteria. They are composed of genetic material (either DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protective coat of protein. Viruses are capable of causing a wide range of diseases in their host organisms.\n\nHowever, without any actual data or references to a \"Dandenong virus,\" I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description for this fictional entity. Virus classification and characterization requires extensive research and study of the specific viral properties, genome, structure, and behavior. Without access to verified information about this purported virus, I do not have sufficient grounds to generate a credible scientific summary.",
