  "description": "Danio aesculapii, also known as the Aesculapius danio, is a species of small freshwater fish belonging to the genus Danio. It is native to the Ayeyarwady River basin in Myanmar (formerly Burma).\n\nThe Aesculapius danio is a member of the Cyprinidae family, which includes various carp and minnow species. It is a relatively small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 5 centimeters (2 inches).\n\nThe body of Danio aesculapii is elongated and laterally compressed, with a streamlined shape. Its coloration is characterized by a silvery-white base with prominent horizontal blue stripes along the sides. These stripes are often more distinct in males, and the fish may also display a reddish or orange hue on the fins.\n\nLike other Danio species, the Aesculapius danio is an active, schooling fish that often inhabits slow-moving or still waters, such as rivers, streams, and lakes. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, plant matter, and algae.\n\nDanio aesculapii is of interest to the aquarium trade and is sometimes kept in home aquariums, though it is not as widely available as some other Danio species. Its small size, vibrant coloration, and schooling behavior make it an attractive addition to community aquariums.",
