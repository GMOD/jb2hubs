  "description": "The Dar es Salaam virus TZ-189 is a virus that was isolated in Tanzania. It belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae, which is a group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. The Dar es Salaam virus TZ-189 is classified as a member of the genus Lyssavirus, which includes the causative agent of rabies and other related viruses.\n\nRhabdoviruses, like the Dar es Salaam virus TZ-189, typically have a bullet-shaped or cone-shaped morphology and possess a genome consisting of approximately 11-15 kilobases. The genome encodes several structural and non-structural proteins that are essential for the virus's replication and assembly.\n\nThe Dar es Salaam virus TZ-189 has been isolated from various animal hosts, including bats, and it is believed to be transmitted through contact with infected animals or their secretions. However, its exact host range, transmission dynamics, and potential for causing disease in humans or other animals are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.",
