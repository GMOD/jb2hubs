  "description": "Dasyprocta punctata, commonly known as the Central American agouti, is a species of large rodent native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Dasyproctidae, which includes various species of agoutis.\n\nThe Central American agouti is a medium-sized rodent, typically weighing between 2.5 to 5.5 kilograms. It has a stocky build, with a rounded body and short, muscular limbs. The animal's coat is typically reddish-brown or grayish-brown in color, with a distinctive pattern of small, dark spots or punctations across its back and sides, which gives the species its scientific name \"punctata.\"\n\nAgoutis are known for their adept climbing abilities and their use of burrows or dens for shelter and nesting. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including fruits, seeds, roots, and leaves. Their diet plays an important role in the dispersal and germination of certain plant species, as they are known to cache and store food for later consumption.\n\nThe Central American agouti is found in a range that extends from southern Mexico to northern South America, inhabiting various forest and woodland habitats, including tropical and subtropical dry forests, humid evergreen forests, and secondary growth areas.\n\nDue to habitat loss and hunting, the Central American agouti is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although its populations may be declining in some areas.",
