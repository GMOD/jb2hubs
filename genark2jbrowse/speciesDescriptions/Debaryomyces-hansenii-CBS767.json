  "description": "Debaryomyces hansenii CBS767 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a member of the genus Debaryomyces, which is known for its ability to adapt to various environmental conditions.\n\nD. hansenii CBS767 is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through budding. It is a heterotrophic organism, meaning it requires organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy for its metabolism.\n\nThis yeast species is known for its high tolerance to various stressors, such as high salt concentrations, low water activity, and low pH levels. These traits make it a useful model organism for studying stress responses and adaptation in eukaryotic cells.\n\nD. hansenii CBS767 has been isolated from a variety of habitats, including soil, marine environments, and food products. It is commonly used in the food and biotechnology industries due to its ability to produce various metabolites and enzymes of commercial interest.\n\nOverall, D. hansenii CBS767 is a well-studied yeast species that has contributed to our understanding of eukaryotic cell biology and its potential applications in various industrial and scientific fields.",
