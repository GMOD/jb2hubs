  "description": "Deinococcus altitudinis is a species of bacterium that was isolated from soil samples collected at high altitudes. It belongs to the genus Deinococcus, which is known for its remarkable resistance to various environmental stresses, including ionizing radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and desiccation.\n\nDeinococcus altitudinis is a gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It exhibits a characteristic red-orange pigmentation, which is attributed to the presence of carotenoid pigments. These pigments are believed to play a role in the bacterium's resistance to oxidative stress and UV radiation.\n\nThe cells of Deinococcus altitudinis are typically coccoid or spherical in shape, with a diameter ranging from 1 to 2 micrometers. They are capable of growing in a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil samples collected from high-altitude regions, such as the Himalayas, and has been found to be well-adapted to thrive in these harsh, oligotrophic environments. Its remarkable stress tolerance and ability to survive in extreme conditions make Deinococcus altitudinis a subject of interest for researchers studying microbial adaptations and potential applications in biotechnology and bioremediation.",
