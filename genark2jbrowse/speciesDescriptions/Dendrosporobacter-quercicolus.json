  "description": "Dendrosporobacter quercicolus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, and anaerobic bacterium. The cells of D. quercicolus are rod-shaped and can form terminal or subterminal endospores.\n\nThis species was first isolated from the gut of the wood-feeding beetle Odontotaenius disjunctus, which is found in decaying oak wood. D. quercicolus is believed to play a role in the degradation of lignocellulosic materials, particularly cellulose and hemicellulose, within the beetle's gut.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that D. quercicolus is closely related to other bacteria found in the guts of wood-feeding insects, suggesting a specialized adaptation to this ecological niche. The species is considered an important member of the microbial community involved in the efficient utilization of plant biomass by these wood-feeding organisms.",
