  "description": "Dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) is a member of the Flavivirus genus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. It is one of the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4) that can cause dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease.\n\nDENV-3 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 11,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane, and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5).\n\nThe envelope (E) protein of DENV-3 plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect and replicate within host cells, particularly mosquito and human cells. The virus primarily uses the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes as vectors for transmission to human hosts.\n\nDENV-3 has been associated with outbreaks in various regions, including Southeast Asia, the Americas, and the Caribbean. Infection with DENV-3 can result in a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome, which can be life-threatening.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular and epidemiological characteristics of DENV-3 is essential for the development of effective diagnostic tools, therapeutic interventions, and prevention strategies to combat the global burden of dengue disease.",
