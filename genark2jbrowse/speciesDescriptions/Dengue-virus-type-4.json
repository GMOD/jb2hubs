  "description": "Dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is one of the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus, which are responsible for causing dengue fever, a significant public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide.\n\nDENV-4 is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Upon infection, the virus replicates within the host's cells, leading to the development of clinical symptoms that can range from mild fever to severe and potentially life-threatening complications, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.\n\nGenetically, DENV-4 can be further divided into several genotypes, which exhibit distinct geographical distributions and evolutionary patterns. Understanding the genetic diversity and epidemiological characteristics of DENV-4 is crucial for the development of effective vaccines, antiviral therapies, and vector control strategies to combat the global burden of dengue disease.",
