  "description": "Denitratisoma oestradiolicum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Denitratisoma oestradiolicum is known for its ability to degrade the estrogen hormone, 17β-estradiol (also known as oestradiol), through a process called denitrification.\n\nThis bacterium was first isolated from activated sludge samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant. It is capable of using 17β-estradiol as a sole carbon and energy source, with nitrate serving as the terminal electron acceptor during the denitrification process.\n\nDenitratisoma oestradiolicum is considered an important microorganism in the context of environmental bioremediation, as it can help remove estrogen-like compounds from wastewater and natural water bodies, where they can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and human health.\n\nThe genome of Denitratisoma oestradiolicum has been sequenced, providing insights into the genetic and metabolic mechanisms underlying its ability to degrade 17β-estradiol. This knowledge can contribute to the development of strategies for the effective removal of endocrine-disrupting compounds from water resources.",
