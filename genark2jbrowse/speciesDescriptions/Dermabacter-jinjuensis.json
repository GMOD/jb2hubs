  "description": "Dermabacter jinjuensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Jinju, South Korea. It belongs to the genus Dermabacter, which is a member of the phylum Actinobacteria.\n\nDermabacter jinjuensis is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium. It is characterized by its ability to grow at a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 10°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. The cells of Dermabacter jinjuensis are typically short rods or coccoid in shape, and they can form branched, mycelium-like structures.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dermabacter jinjuensis is closely related to other Dermabacter species, such as Dermabacter hominis, which is commonly found in human skin and clinical samples.\n\nThe specific ecological roles and potential applications of Dermabacter jinjuensis are not yet fully understood, but as a member of the Actinobacteria, it may play a role in soil nutrient cycling or have potential for biotechnological use, such as in the production of industrially relevant enzymes or secondary metabolites.",
