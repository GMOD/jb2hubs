  "description": "Dermochelys coriacea, commonly known as the leatherback sea turtle, is the largest living sea turtle species. It is the only extant member of the family Dermochelyidae and one of the most unique and ancient reptiles on Earth.\n\nDistinguishing features:\n- Distinct leathery, ridged carapace (upper shell) without the typical bony plates found in other sea turtles.\n- Streamlined, barrel-shaped body with elongated, paddle-like flippers for efficient swimming.\n- Lacks a hard shell, instead having a skin composed of oily, tough connective tissue.\n- Able to maintain a higher body temperature than surrounding waters, allowing it to inhabit colder oceanic regions.\n\nEcology and Behavior:\n- Highly migratory, traveling vast distances across the world's oceans to feed on jellyfish and other gelatinous prey.\n- Undertakes some of the longest migrations of any reptile, moving between tropical nesting beaches and productive foraging grounds.\n- Females lay their eggs on tropical and subtropical sandy beaches, with hatchlings emerging and making their way to the ocean.\n- Classified as a vulnerable species, facing threats from bycatch, pollution, and habitat degradation throughout its global range.\n\nEvolutionary History:\n- Descended from an ancient lineage, with fossil records dating back over 100 million years.\n- Considered a \"living fossil,\" retaining many primitive characteristics of early sea turtles.\n- Represents a unique evolutionary adaptation, with its distinct body plan and physiology enabling it to occupy a specialized ecological niche.",
