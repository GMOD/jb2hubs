  "description": "Desarmillaria tabescens is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Armillariaceae. It is a wood-decay fungus that primarily infects and causes disease in various tree species, particularly hardwoods such as oak, beech, and maple.\n\nThe key characteristics of Desarmillaria tabescens are as follows:\n\n1. Fruiting body: The fruiting body of D. tabescens is a mushroom-like structure, typically with a convex to flat cap that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The cap is brown to reddish-brown in color and has a slightly scaly or fibrillose surface.\n\n2. Stem: The stem is centrally attached to the cap, and it can be up to 15 cm long and 2-4 cm thick. The stem is typically the same color as the cap and has a ring-like structure near the top, which is the remnant of the partial veil that covers the gills when the mushroom is young.\n\n3. Gills: The gills are decurrent, meaning they extend down the stem, and they are white to cream-colored, sometimes with a pinkish hue.\n\n4. Spores: The spores of D. tabescens are white, smooth, and ellipsoid in shape.\n\n5. Ecology: Desarmillaria tabescens is a parasitic fungus that infects and causes disease in various tree species, particularly hardwoods. It can cause a condition known as Armillaria root rot, which can lead to the decline and eventual death of the infected trees.\n\n6. Distribution: Desarmillaria tabescens is widely distributed across North America, Europe, and Asia, where it is found in forested areas.",
