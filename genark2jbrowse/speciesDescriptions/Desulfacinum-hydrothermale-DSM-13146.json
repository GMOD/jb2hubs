  "description": "Desulfacinum hydrothermale DSM 13146 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment. Some key features of this species are:\n\n1. Classification: Desulfacinum hydrothermale belongs to the domain Bacteria, phylum Proteobacteria, class Deltaproteobacteria, order Desulfobacterales, and family Desulfobacteraceae.\n\n2. Morphology: Cells are curved rods, approximately 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width.\n\n3. Habitat and Physiology: Desulfacinum hydrothermale is an anaerobic, chemolithoautotrophic bacterium that can use hydrogen, formate, and various organic compounds as electron donors, and sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor, producing hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct.\n\n4. Growth Conditions: The optimal growth temperature is around 50°C, with a range of 35-55°C. It can grow at a pH range of 5.5-7.5, with an optimal pH of 6.5-7.0.\n\n5. Ecology: This species is found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle by coupling the oxidation of organic matter or hydrogen to the reduction of sulfate.\n\n6. Significance: Desulfacinum hydrothermale is of interest for its ability to thrive in the extreme conditions of deep-sea hydrothermal vents and its potential role in the cycling of sulfur and other elements in these unique ecosystems.",
