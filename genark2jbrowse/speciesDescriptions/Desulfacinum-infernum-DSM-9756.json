  "description": "Desulfacinum infernum DSM 9756 is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria. It was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent system in the Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California.\n\nSome key features of this species:\n\n1. Phylogeny: Desulfacinum infernum belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Deltaproteobacteria, and family Desulfobacteraceae.\n\n2. Morphology: Cells are vibrio-shaped, approximately 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width.\n\n3. Physiology: Desulfacinum infernum is a chemolithoautotroph, capable of using hydrogen as an electron donor and carbon dioxide as a carbon source. It can reduce sulfate to sulfide as a means of energy conservation.\n\n4. Temperature and pH: This species is a thermophile, with an optimal growth temperature between 55-65°C, and can tolerate temperatures up to 75°C. The optimal pH range for growth is between 6.0-7.5.\n\n5. Habitat and Ecology: Desulfacinum infernum is found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle by coupling the oxidation of hydrogen with the reduction of sulfate.\n\n6. Genome and Metabolism: The genome of Desulfacinum infernum has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the extreme deep-sea vent environment.\n\nThis anaerobic, thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacterium is an important component of the microbial community in deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, contributing to the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and other elements in these unique and extreme habitats.",
