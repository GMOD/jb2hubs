  "description": "Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans DSM 16219 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from marine sediments. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and motile bacterium.\n\nThe key characteristics of this species are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Metabolism: Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans is a chemoheterotrophic organism that can utilize a variety of organic compounds, including alkenes, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate to sulfide.\n\n3. Physiology: It is a mesophilic bacterium, growing optimally at temperatures between 25-30°C and at a pH range of 6.5-7.5.\n\n4. Phylogeny: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Deltaproteobacteria, and order Desulfobacterales.\n\n5. Ecological Significance: This species plays a role in the sulfur and carbon cycles in marine environments, particularly in the degradation of alkanes and alkenes.\n\n6. Biotechnological Potential: Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated environments and the production of biofuels from renewable resources.",
