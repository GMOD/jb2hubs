  "description": "Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans DSM 11544 is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria that belongs to the genus Desulfitobacterium. This bacterium was first isolated from a freshwater sediment sample collected in Germany.\n\nKey features of Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans DSM 11544:\n\n1. Anaerobic metabolism: As an anaerobic bacterium, D. chlororespirans can grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Chlororespiration: The bacterium is capable of using chlorinated organic compounds, such as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE), as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration, a process known as chlororespiration.\n\n3. Sulfite reduction: D. chlororespirans can also use sulfite as an electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide during its energy-generating metabolism.\n\n4. Phylogeny and taxonomy: Phylogenetically, D. chlororespirans belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and is closely related to other Desulfitobacterium species, which are known for their ability to dechlorinate various halogenated organic compounds.\n\n5. Habitat and isolation: The type strain, DSM 11544, was isolated from a freshwater sediment sample, indicating that this bacterium is found in aquatic environments.\n\nThis species of Desulfitobacterium is of interest due to its potential applications in bioremediation, where it could be used to degrade and remove chlorinated organic pollutants from contaminated environments through its chlororespiratory capabilities.",
