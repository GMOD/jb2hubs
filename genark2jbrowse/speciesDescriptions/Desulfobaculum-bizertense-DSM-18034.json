  "description": "Desulfobaculum bizertense DSM 18034 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from marine sediments collected near Bizerte, Tunisia. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium that is capable of using sulfate, sulfite, and thiosulfate as terminal electron acceptors during the oxidation of various organic compounds.\n\nThe cells of Desulfobaculum bizertense DSM 18034 are curved rods, approximately 1.5-2.5 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are motile by means of a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 25-35°C and a pH range of 6.5-7.5.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfobaculum bizertense DSM 18034 belongs to the family Desulfobacteraceae within the class Deltaproteobacteria. It is closely related to other sulfate-reducing bacteria within the genus Desulfobaculum, which are known to play important roles in the cycling of sulfur and carbon in marine and other anoxic environments.\n\nThe genome of Desulfobaculum bizertense DSM 18034 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and ecological function in its natural habitat. Understanding the physiology and genetic characteristics of this species can contribute to our knowledge of the diversity and roles of sulfate-reducing bacteria in various ecosystems.",
