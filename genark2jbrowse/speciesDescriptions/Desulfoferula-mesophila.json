  "description": "Desulfoferula mesophila is a species of anaerobic, mesophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria. It was isolated from a mesophilic bioreactor treating wastewater from a paper mill.\n\nSome key characteristics of Desulfoferula mesophila:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Physiology: Desulfoferula mesophila is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is a mesophile, growing optimally at temperatures between 25-40°C.\n\n3. Metabolism: The bacterium is a dissimilatory sulfate-reducer, capable of using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration. It can utilize a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and certain amino acids, as carbon and energy sources.\n\n4. Phylogeny: Desulfoferula mesophila belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class within the Proteobacteria phylum. It is closely related to other sulfate-reducing bacteria within the Desulfobacteraceae family.\n\n5. Ecology: This species has been found in anaerobic environments like wastewater treatment systems, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle by converting sulfate to sulfide.\n\nOverall, Desulfoferula mesophila is a physiologically and phylogenetically characterized sulfate-reducing bacterium with potential applications in wastewater treatment and bioremediation processes.",
