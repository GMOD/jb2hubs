  "description": "Desulfofundulus australicus DSM 11792 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a sediment sample collected in Australia. It is an anaerobic, mesophilic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium, meaning it grows best in the absence of oxygen, at moderate temperatures, and utilizes organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources.\n\nThis species is capable of reducing sulfate to sulfide, which is a key step in the sulfur cycle in various environments. Desulfofundulus australicus DSM 11792 can use a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfofundulus australicus DSM 11792 belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class within the Desulfobacterales order. It is closely related to other sulfate-reducing bacteria within the Desulfofundulus genus, which are known to play important roles in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and other elements in various ecosystems.",
