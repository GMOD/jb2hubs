  "description": "Desulfofundulus thermosubterraneus DSM 16057 is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a deep subsurface thermal aquifer. Some key features of this species:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.5-4.0 μm in length, and occur singly or in pairs.\n\n2. Physiology: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is a thermophile, with an optimal growth temperature between 55-60°C.\n\n3. Metabolism: Desulfofundulus thermosubterraneus is a chemolithoautotroph, capable of using hydrogen as an electron donor and carbon dioxide as a carbon source for growth. It is also a dissimilatory sulfate reducer, using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor and producing sulfide as a byproduct.\n\n4. Habitat and Distribution: This species was isolated from a deep subsurface thermal aquifer, indicating its ability to thrive in the hot, anoxic, and energy-limited conditions found in deep terrestrial environments.\n\n5. Taxonomy and Phylogeny: Desulfofundulus thermosubterraneus belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Thermodesulfobiaceae. It is closely related to other thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria within the genus Desulfofundulus.\n\nOverall, Desulfofundulus thermosubterraneus DSM 16057 is a unique, anaerobic, thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium adapted to life in deep, subsurface thermal environments, playing a role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur and carbon in these ecosystems.",
