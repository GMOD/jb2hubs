  "description": "Desulfofustis glycolicus DSM 9705 is a species of anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. It was isolated from a sulfidogenic bioreactor treating wastewater from a paper mill.\n\nSome key characteristics of Desulfofustis glycolicus DSM 9705:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are straight rods, 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 2-4 μm long, occurring singly or in pairs.\n\n2. Physiology: It is an obligate anaerobe, capable of using glycolate, lactate, pyruvate, and several other organic compounds as electron donors, coupled to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide.\n\n3. Metabolism: Desulfofustis glycolicus is a chemoheterotrophic organism, deriving energy from the oxidation of organic compounds with the concomitant reduction of sulfate.\n\n4. Phylogeny: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Desulfofustis glycolicus is classified within the Desulfotomaculum group of the Firmicutes phylum, sharing close evolutionary relationships with other sulfate-reducing bacteria.\n\n5. Ecology: It is found in anaerobic environments, such as wastewater treatment systems, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle by coupling the oxidation of organic matter to the reduction of sulfate.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and wastewater treatment processes involving the removal of sulfate and organic pollutants.",
