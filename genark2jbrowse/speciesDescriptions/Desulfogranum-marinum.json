  "description": "Desulfogranum marinum is a species of anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from marine sediments. Some key scientific characteristics of this species are:\n\n1. Phylogeny: Desulfogranum marinum belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Deltaproteobacteria, and the order Desulfobacterales.\n\n2. Morphology: Cells are vibrio-shaped, approximately 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are Gram-negative and non-spore-forming.\n\n3. Physiology: Desulfogranum marinum is an obligate anaerobe that uses sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor for respiration, reducing it to sulfide. It can utilize a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors.\n\n4. Habitat and Distribution: This species was originally isolated from marine sediments collected from the East China Sea. It is likely widely distributed in marine environments where anaerobic conditions and sulfate are present.\n\n5. Significance: As a sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfogranum marinum plays a role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in marine ecosystems. It can also be of interest in bioremediation applications involving the removal of sulfate and heavy metals from contaminated environments.\n\nThis brief summary highlights the key taxonomic, morphological, physiological, and ecological characteristics of the Desulfogranum marinum species based on scientific literature.",
