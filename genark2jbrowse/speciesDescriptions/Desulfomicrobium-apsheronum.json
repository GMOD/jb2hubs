  "description": "Desulfomicrobium apsheronum is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from oil-contaminated soil samples collected from the Absheron Peninsula in Azerbaijan. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile bacterium that is capable of anaerobic respiration using sulfate as the terminal electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide.\n\nThe cells of D. apsheronum are typically rod-shaped, approximately 1-2 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are able to grow optimally at temperatures between 30-37°C and at a pH range of 6.5-8.0. This species is considered to be halotolerant, able to grow in the presence of up to 70 g/L of NaCl.\n\nPhylogenetically, D. apsheronum belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class and is closely related to other species within the Desulfomicrobium genus. It is known to play a role in the sulfur cycle and can be involved in the bioremediation of oil-contaminated environments due to its ability to metabolize and degrade hydrocarbon compounds.",
