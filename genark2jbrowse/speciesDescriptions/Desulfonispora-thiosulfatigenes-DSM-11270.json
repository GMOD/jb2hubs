  "description": "Desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes DSM 11270 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a sulfidogenic bioreactor. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium.\n\nThe key features of this species are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are straight to slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length.\n\n2. Metabolism: Desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes is capable of using thiosulfate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide. It can also utilize a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as carbon and energy sources.\n\n3. Physiology: The optimal growth temperature is around 37°C, and the optimal pH range is between 6.5 and 7.5. It is capable of growth in the presence of up to 2% (w/v) NaCl.\n\n4. Phylogeny: Phylogenetically, Desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes belongs to the class Deltaproteobacteria, within the order Desulfobacterales, and the family Desulfobulbaceae.\n\n5. Habitat and Ecology: This bacterium was originally isolated from a sulfidogenic bioreactor, indicating its potential role in sulfur cycling and bioremediation processes in anoxic environments.\n\nOverall, Desulfonispora thiosulfatigenes DSM 11270 is a metabolically versatile, sulfate-reducing bacterium that can play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in various anaerobic ecosystems.",
