  "description": "Desulfopila aestuarii DSM 18488 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from estuarine sediments. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium that can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources.\n\nSome key features of Desulfopila aestuarii DSM 18488 include:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are vibrio-shaped, approximately 1.5-2.5 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width.\n\n2. Metabolism: This species is capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction, using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor and oxidizing various organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, to acetate.\n\n3. Growth conditions: Desulfopila aestuarii DSM 18488 is a mesophilic bacterium, with an optimal growth temperature range of 25-35°C and a pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5.\n\n4. Phylogeny and taxonomy: Phylogenetically, Desulfopila aestuarii DSM 18488 belongs to the class Deltaproteobacteria, order Desulfobacterales, and family Desulfobulbaceae.\n\n5. Habitat and ecology: This species is commonly found in estuarine and coastal marine sediments, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle by coupling the oxidation of organic matter to the reduction of sulfate.\n\nOverall, Desulfopila aestuarii DSM 18488 is a well-studied representative of the sulfate-reducing bacteria found in estuarine environments, contributing to our understanding of the microbial diversity and functions in these dynamic ecosystems.",
