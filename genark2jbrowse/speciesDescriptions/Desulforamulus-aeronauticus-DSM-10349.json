  "description": "Desulforamulus aeronauticus DSM 10349 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a sample collected from the interior of an aircraft. The species was first described in 2002 and is classified within the genus Desulforamulus, which belongs to the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nDesulforamulus aeronauticus is an anaerobic, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium. It is capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction, using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor during cellular respiration and producing hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 30-37Â°C and a pH range of 6.5-7.5.\n\nGenomic analysis has revealed that D. aeronauticus possesses genes involved in sulfate reduction pathways, as well as genes related to stress response and adaptation to the aircraft environment. This species is of interest due to its potential role in the biodeterioration of materials used in aircraft construction and the production of corrosive hydrogen sulfide, which can impact the integrity of aircraft systems.",
