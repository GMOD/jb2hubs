  "description": "Desulforamulus putei DSM 12395 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a deep subsurface groundwater sample. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. \n\nThe cells of Desulforamulus putei DSM 12395 are rod-shaped and motile with the help of flagella. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can tolerate a wide range of pH conditions, from 5.5 to 8.0.\n\nDesulforamulus putei DSM 12395 is capable of using a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and formate, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. This metabolic capability makes it an important component of microbial communities involved in the sulfur cycle in deep subsurface environments.\n\nThe genome of Desulforamulus putei DSM 12395 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic pathways, adaptation mechanisms, and potential ecological roles in its natural habitat.",
