  "description": "Desulfosarcina variabilis str. Montpellier is a species of anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the genus Desulfosarcina. It was isolated from marine sediments collected near Montpellier, France.\n\nDesulfosarcina variabilis str. Montpellier is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium. It is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors and reducing sulfate to sulfide as part of its anaerobic respiration. \n\nThe optimal growth conditions for this strain include a temperature range of 25-35Â°C and a pH range of 6.5-7.5. It is considered a mesophilic and neutrophilic organism.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfosarcina variabilis str. Montpellier is closely related to other members of the Desulfosarcina genus, which are known to play important roles in the sulfur cycle in marine and estuarine environments.",
