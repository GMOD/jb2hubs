  "description": "Desulfoscipio geothermicus DSM 3669 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a geothermal spring in New Zealand. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and thermophilic bacterium, capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 45°C to 65°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 55°C.\n\nMorphologically, Desulfoscipio geothermicus DSM 3669 is a rod-shaped bacterium, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. It is capable of motility, facilitated by the presence of polar flagella.\n\nMetabolically, this species is a chemoorganotroph, deriving its energy and carbon from the oxidation of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and various amino acids. It is capable of reducing sulfate to sulfide, which is a characteristic feature of sulfate-reducing bacteria.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfoscipio geothermicus DSM 3669 belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, within the class Deltaproteobacteria. It is closely related to other thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria within the genus Desulfoscipio.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation, particularly in the removal of sulfate and heavy metals from industrial wastewater and contaminated environments under high-temperature conditions.",
