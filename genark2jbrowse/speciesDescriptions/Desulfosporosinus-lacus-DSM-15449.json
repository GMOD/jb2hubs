  "description": "Desulfosporosinus lacus DSM 15449 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a freshwater lake sediment. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, strictly anaerobic bacterium that can use a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate to sulfide.\n\nThe cells of Desulfosporosinus lacus DSM 15449 are rod-shaped, motile, and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can tolerate a pH range of 5.5 to 8.0.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfosporosinus lacus DSM 15449 belongs to the Desulfosporosinus genus within the Firmicutes phylum. This genus is known for its ability to degrade various organic compounds and play a role in the sulfur cycle in various environments, including freshwater, groundwater, and soil.\n\nThe genome of Desulfosporosinus lacus DSM 15449 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles in the environments where it is found.",
