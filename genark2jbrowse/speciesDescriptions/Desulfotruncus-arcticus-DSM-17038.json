  "description": "Desulfotruncus arcticus DSM 17038 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from Arctic marine sediments. It is a Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of D. arcticus DSM 17038 are short, straight rods, typically measuring 1.5-2.5 μm in length and 0.5-0.7 μm in width. They grow optimally at a temperature of 10-15°C and a pH range of 6.5-7.5, reflecting their adaptation to the cold and slightly acidic conditions of the Arctic environment.\n\nAs a sulfate-reducing bacterium, D. arcticus DSM 17038 is capable of using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration, coupling this process to the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen. This metabolic activity plays a crucial role in the sulfur cycle and the cycling of carbon in Arctic marine sediments.\n\nPhylogenetically, D. arcticus DSM 17038 belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class and is closely related to other sulfate-reducing bacteria within the Desulfotruncus genus. This genus is characterized by its unique cell morphology and its ability to thrive in cold, high-latitude environments.\n\nThe availability of the genome sequence for D. arcticus DSM 17038 has provided insights into its genetic and metabolic capabilities, contributing to our understanding of the role of this species in the Arctic ecosystem and its potential applications in bioremediation or biotechnological processes.",
