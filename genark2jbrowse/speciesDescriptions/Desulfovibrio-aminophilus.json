  "description": "Desulfovibrio aminophilus is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Desulfovibrio, which are known for their ability to reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Desulfovibrio aminophilus is a Gram-negative, curved or spiral-shaped, motile bacterium that is anaerobic, meaning it can grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\nThis species was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant and is characterized by its ability to use amino acids as a carbon and energy source, in addition to the typical sulfate reduction process. Desulfovibrio aminophilus is capable of utilizing a variety of amino acids, including alanine, serine, threonine, and glutamate, for its growth and metabolism.\n\nThe cells of Desulfovibrio aminophilus are typically 2-4 micrometers in length and 0.5-0.8 micrometers in width. They are known to produce hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct of their sulfate reduction process, which can contribute to the characteristic \"rotten egg\" odor associated with some anaerobic environments.\n\nDesulfovibrio aminophilus is of interest in the field of environmental microbiology, as it plays a role in the sulfur cycle and can be found in various anaerobic habitats, such as sediments, wastewater treatment systems, and the gastrointestinal tracts of some animals.",
