  "description": "Desulfovibrio litoralis DSM 11393 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a coastal marine environment. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile, curved rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nSome key features of Desulfovibrio litoralis DSM 11393:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is an anaerobic, chemoheterotrophic bacterium that uses sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor, reducing it to sulfide during the process of dissimilatory sulfate reduction.\n\n2. Growth conditions: It can grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 40°C, with an optimum around 30°C. It tolerates moderate salinity levels and can grow in the presence of up to 4% NaCl.\n\n3. Phylogeny: Desulfovibrio litoralis belongs to the genus Desulfovibrio, which is a well-known group of sulfate-reducing bacteria within the Deltaproteobacteria class.\n\n4. Ecology: As its name suggests, Desulfovibrio litoralis was isolated from a coastal marine environment and likely plays a role in the sulfur cycle in these habitats.\n\n5. Potential applications: Sulfate-reducing bacteria like Desulfovibrio litoralis are of interest for their potential use in bioremediation of sulfate-containing waste streams and for their role in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur.\n\nThis brief description highlights the key taxonomic, physiological, and ecological characteristics of the Desulfovibrio litoralis DSM 11393 strain based on available scientific information.",
