  "description": "Desulfurella multipotens is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic, sulfur-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, United States. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile bacterium that can utilize a variety of electron donors, including hydrogen, formate, and various organic compounds, for the reduction of elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as the terminal electron acceptor. Desulfurella multipotens is capable of growth at temperatures ranging from 45°C to 65°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 55°C. It is a chemolithoautotrophic organism, meaning it can fix carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source. This species plays a role in the sulfur cycle within its thermal spring habitat by coupling the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen to the reduction of sulfur compounds.",
