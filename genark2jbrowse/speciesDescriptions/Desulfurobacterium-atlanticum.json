  "description": "Desulfurobacterium atlanticum is a species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent located in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a hyperthermophilic, anaerobic, and sulfur-reducing microorganism.\n\nSome key features of Desulfurobacterium atlanticum:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a rod-shaped bacterium, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm wide and 1.2-2.5 μm long.\n\n2. Habitat: It was recovered from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent system at a depth of around 2,600 meters in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n3. Metabolism: Desulfurobacterium atlanticum is a chemolithoautotroph, meaning it obtains its energy through the oxidation of inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen or reduced sulfur compounds, and uses carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source.\n\n4. Temperature range: It is a hyperthermophilic organism, with an optimal growth temperature between 70-75°C and a maximum growth temperature of around 80°C.\n\n5. Anaerobic respiration: Desulfurobacterium atlanticum is an anaerobic bacterium, using elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as terminal electron acceptors during its respiratory process, producing hydrogen sulfide as a byproduct.\n\n6. Phylogeny: Phylogenetically, Desulfurobacterium atlanticum belongs to the Aquificae phylum, which comprises a group of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic bacteria adapted to live in high-temperature environments, such as volcanic and hydrothermal systems.\n\nThis species provides insights into the diversity and adaptations of microbial life in the extreme and energy-rich deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems.",
