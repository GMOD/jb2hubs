  "description": "Devosia albogilva is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Devosia. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Devosia albogilva was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Devosia albogilva are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.7-1.2 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and have a white to pale yellow color.\n\nDevosia albogilva is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH conditions, from 5.0 to 8.5, with an optimal pH of approximately 7.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Devosia albogilva is closely related to other members of the genus Devosia, which are known to be associated with various environmental niches, including soil, water, and plant-associated habitats.\n\nThe exact ecological roles and functions of Devosia albogilva in its natural environment are not yet fully understood, but the genus Devosia is known to include species with diverse metabolic capabilities, potentially involved in nutrient cycling and other important biogeochemical processes in the environments where they are found.",
