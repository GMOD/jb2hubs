  "description": "Devosia enhydra is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the feces of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) found in California, United States. It belongs to the genus Devosia, which is a member of the family Hyphomicrobiaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nDevosia enhydra is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is characterized by its ability to form rod-shaped cells and its distinctive orange-pigmented colonies when grown on agar media. The species is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Devosia enhydra is closely related to other Devosia species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. The isolation of this species from the gut of sea otters suggests that it may play a role in the ecology and gut microbiome of these marine mammals.",
