  "description": "Devosia equisanguinis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the blood of a horse. It belongs to the genus Devosia, which is a group of Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria.\n\nThe cells of Devosia equisanguinis are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum, which allows them to move through their environment.\n\nPhylogenetically, Devosia equisanguinis is classified within the family Devosiaceae, which is part of the order Rhizobiales, a group of bacteria known for their symbiotic relationships with plants, particularly in the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nThe species name \"equisanguinis\" refers to its isolation from the blood of a horse (equus is the genus name for horses, and sanguinis means \"of blood\" in Latin).\n\nDevosia equisanguinis is considered an aerobic, chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. Its optimal growth temperature is reported to be around 30°C.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles and potential applications of this bacterial species, as its discovery in the blood of a horse suggests it may have interesting physiological or pathogenic properties worth investigating.",
