  "description": "Diabrotica undecimpunctata, commonly known as the spotted cucumber beetle or western corn rootworm, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Chrysomelidae. It is a significant agricultural pest known for its ability to damage various crops, particularly cucurbit plants and corn.\n\nThe Diabrotica undecimpunctata is a small, oval-shaped beetle, typically measuring between 5-7 millimeters in length. Its body is yellowish-green in color, with eleven distinct black spots on its wing covers, hence the name \"undecimpunctata\" (meaning \"eleven-spotted\"). The beetle's antennae are long and slender, and its legs are also yellowish-green.\n\nThe larvae of the Diabrotica undecimpunctata, also known as corn rootworms, feed on the roots of corn plants, causing significant damage to the crop. The adult beetles, on the other hand, feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruit of a variety of plants, including cucumbers, melons, squash, and other cucurbit crops, as well as corn.\n\nThe Diabrotica undecimpunctata is found across North America, with a widespread distribution ranging from Canada to Mexico. It is considered a major agricultural pest and has been the subject of extensive research and management strategies to mitigate the economic impact of its damage to crops.",
