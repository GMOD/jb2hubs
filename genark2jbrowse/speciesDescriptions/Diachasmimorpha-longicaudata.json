  "description": "Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is a species of parasitoid wasp belonging to the family Braconidae. It is known as the Caribbean fruit fly parasitoid or the long-tailed parasitoid wasp.\n\nThe key features of this species are:\n\n1. Size: Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is a small wasp, typically measuring around 4-6 millimeters in length.\n\n2. Morphology: The species has a slender body and a distinctive, elongated ovipositor (egg-laying apparatus) that can be up to twice the length of its body. This long ovipositor allows the female wasp to reach and parasitize fruit fly larvae deep within the host fruit.\n\n3. Habitat and Distribution: Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is native to Southeast Asia and has been introduced to various regions around the world as a biological control agent against fruit fly pests, particularly the Caribbean fruit fly (Anastrepha suspensa) and the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata).\n\n4. Life Cycle and Behavior: The female wasp lays its eggs inside the larvae of the target fruit fly species. The wasp larvae then develop within the host larva, eventually killing it and emerging as adult wasps. This parasitic relationship makes Diachasmimorpha longicaudata an effective natural enemy of certain economically important fruit fly pests.\n\n5. Biological Control: Due to its ability to parasitize and suppress fruit fly populations, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata has been widely used in biological control programs to manage fruit fly infestations in various agricultural and horticultural settings.\n\nOverall, Diachasmimorpha longicaudata is an important natural enemy of several fruit fly species and has been successfully utilized in integrated pest management strategies to reduce the economic impact of these agricultural pests.",
