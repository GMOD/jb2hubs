  "description": "Diadema antillarum, commonly known as the black sea urchin or the West Indian sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in the Caribbean Sea and the western Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the family Diadematidae.\n\nDiadema antillarum is a large, globular sea urchin with a dark, almost black, test (shell) and long, slender, venomous spines that can grow up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length. The spines are used for defense and to deter predators. The urchin's mouth is located on the underside of the test, and it uses its tube feet to move and capture food, primarily algae.\n\nThis species plays a crucial role in the Caribbean reef ecosystem, as it helps to maintain the balance between algae and coral growth. Diadema antillarum is known to graze on algae, preventing them from outcompeting and smothering the coral polyps. However, the population of this sea urchin has declined significantly in the Caribbean due to a disease outbreak in the 1980s, which has had a profound impact on the overall health and resilience of Caribbean coral reef ecosystems.",
