  "description": "Dialister micraerophilus is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria belonging to the genus Dialister. It is a fastidious, microaerophilic bacterium, meaning it requires low levels of oxygen for optimal growth.\n\nDialister micraerophilus is a coccobacillus, typically appearing as short, rounded rods or cocci in microscopic observations. It is considered part of the normal human gut microbiome, being found in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individuals.\n\nThis species is known to be involved in various metabolic processes within the human body, particularly in the fermentation of carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. Due to its presence in the gut, Dialister micraerophilus may play a role in maintaining a balanced and healthy gut microbiome.\n\nHowever, in some cases, Dialister micraerophilus has been associated with certain disease states, such as periodontitis and other oral infections. Its potential pathogenic role is an area of ongoing research and investigation within the scientific community.",
