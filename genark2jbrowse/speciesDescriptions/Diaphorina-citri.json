  "description": "Diaphorina citri, commonly known as the Asian citrus psyllid, is a small sap-sucking insect that belongs to the family Psyllidae. It is a significant pest of citrus plants, including oranges, lemons, limes, and mandarins, as it acts as a vector for the bacterial plant disease known as huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening.\n\nThe adult D. citri is approximately 3-4 millimeters in length, with a brownish-gray body and transparent wings. The nymphs, or immature stages, are flattened, yellowish-orange in color, and possess a distinctive waxy covering. Both the adults and nymphs feed on the phloem sap of citrus plants, which can weaken the plant and lead to reduced fruit production and quality.\n\nThe Asian citrus psyllid is native to Asia and has spread to other parts of the world, including the Americas and the Mediterranean region, primarily through the transport of infected plant material. It is considered a major threat to citrus production globally, as the bacterial pathogen it transmits, Candidatus Liberibacter spp., can cause severe and often fatal disease in citrus trees.\n\nEffective management of D. citri and the associated huanglongbing disease involves a combination of strategies, including the use of insecticides, biological control agents, and the development of resistant citrus cultivars. Ongoing research continues to explore new approaches to control this invasive pest and mitigate the impact of citrus greening on the global citrus industry.",
