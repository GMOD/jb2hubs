  "description": "Diaphorobacter limosus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium. Diaphorobacter limosus was isolated from a mud sample collected from a freshwater lake.\n\nThe cells of Diaphorobacter limosus are rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0.\n\nDiaphorobacter limosus is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources. It can also reduce nitrate to nitrite, indicating its ability to participate in the nitrogen cycle.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Diaphorobacter limosus is closely related to other members of the Diaphorobacter genus, which are commonly found in freshwater and soil environments.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of Diaphorobacter limosus are still under investigation, as further research is needed to fully understand its physiological capabilities and interactions within its natural habitat.",
