  "description": "Dibamus cf. smithi is a species of worm lizard, a type of burrowing reptile found in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the genus Dibamus, which are small, limbless lizards that live underground and have a cylindrical, snake-like body.\n\nThe \"cf.\" in the species name indicates that the identification is not entirely certain, and the species may be closely related to or potentially a subspecies of Dibamus smithi. Worm lizards in the genus Dibamus are typically characterized by their lack of external limbs, small eyes, and specialized adaptations for burrowing and moving through soil and leaf litter.\n\nLike other Dibamus species, Dibamus cf. smithi likely spends most of its time underground, emerging only occasionally. It likely feeds on small invertebrates found in the soil. The species' specific habitat requirements, behavior, and natural history are not well documented due to the elusive and secretive nature of these burrowing reptiles.",
