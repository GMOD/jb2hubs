  "description": "Dictyobacter halimunensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in a nature reserve located in West Java, Indonesia. It belongs to the genus Dictyobacter, which is classified within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe cells of Dictyobacter halimunensis are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic. They exhibit a rod-shaped morphology and are capable of gliding motility. Colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow-pigmented.\n\nPhysiologically, Dictyobacter halimunensis is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. It can tolerate a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, with a preferred pH of 7.0. The bacterium is also capable of hydrolyzing various polymeric substances, such as starch and casein.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Dictyobacter halimunensis is most closely related to other members of the genus Dictyobacter, sharing approximately 95% sequence similarity with its closest known relatives.\n\nThis species was named Dictyobacter halimunensis, where \"halimunensis\" refers to the Halimun Mountain area in West Java, Indonesia, from where the original soil samples were collected.",
