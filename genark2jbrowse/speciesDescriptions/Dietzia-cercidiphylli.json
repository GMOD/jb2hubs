  "description": "Dietzia cercidiphylli is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from the rhizosphere (the soil surrounding plant roots) of the Katsura tree (Cercidiphyllum japonicum) in Japan. The species was named after the plant genus Cercidiphyllum, from which it was isolated.\n\nDietzia cercidiphylli is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, coccoid to short-rod-shaped bacterium. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of carbon sources for energy and growth, including various carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Dietzia cercidiphylli is closely related to other members of the genus Dietzia, which are known to be found in diverse environments, including soil, water, and even clinical samples.\n\nThe role and potential applications of Dietzia cercidiphylli in its natural environment or in biotechnological processes are still under investigation, as the species was only recently described and characterized.",
