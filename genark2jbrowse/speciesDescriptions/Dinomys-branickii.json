  "description": "Dinomys branickii, commonly known as the pacarana, is a large rodent species native to South America. It belongs to the family Dinomyidae, which is a family of rodents that includes only a single living species, the pacarana.\n\nThe pacarana is a robust, stocky animal with a large, rounded head and short, thick limbs. It has a distinctive pelage, with a coarse, grizzled coat that can range in color from dark brown to reddish-brown. The pacarana is characterized by the presence of four toes on each foot, with the innermost toe being reduced in size.\n\nThese rodents are primarily nocturnal and arboreal, spending much of their time foraging for a variety of plant materials, including fruits, leaves, and roots. They are social animals, often living in small family groups and communicating through a range of vocalizations and scent markings.\n\nThe pacarana is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and hunting for its meat and fur. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and fascinating member of the rodent family.",
