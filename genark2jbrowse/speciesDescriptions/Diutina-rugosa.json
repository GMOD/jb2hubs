  "description": "Diutina rugosa is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a yeast-like organism that typically forms spherical or elliptical cells with a rough or wrinkled (rugose) surface texture. Diutina rugosa is commonly found in soil, decaying plant material, and the human gastrointestinal tract, where it can occasionally cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. The species is known for its ability to reproduce asexually through budding, a process in which new cells are formed as outgrowths from the parent cell. Diutina rugosa is considered an ascomycetous yeast, as it belongs to the class Saccharomycetes, which includes other well-known yeast species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the baker's yeast.",
