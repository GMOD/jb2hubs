  "description": "Dokdonella ginsengisoli is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil collected from a ginseng field in South Korea. It belongs to the Dokdonella genus, which is a member of the Cytophagaceae family within the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n\nSome key scientific features of Dokdonella ginsengisoli are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped.\n\n2. Colony characteristics: On agar plates, the colonies appear yellow, smooth, and circular.\n\n3. Temperature and pH range: Dokdonella ginsengisoli is capable of growth at temperatures between 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28°C. It can tolerate a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, with an optimal pH of 7.0.\n\n4. Chemotaxonomic features: The major fatty acids present in the cell membrane are iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or C16:1ω6c).\n\n5. Genomic characteristics: The G+C content of the genomic DNA is around 42.4 mol%.\n\n6. Phylogenetic analysis: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Dokdonella ginsengisoli is most closely related to other Dokdonella species, such as Dokdonella koreensis.\n\nThis bacterium was first described in 2008 and is believed to play a role in the soil ecosystem, potentially contributing to the decomposition of organic matter or other biogeochemical processes in the ginseng-cultivated environment.",
