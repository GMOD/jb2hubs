  "description": "Dokdonella soli is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically within the class Gammaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Dokdonella soli are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are described as being short rods or coccoid in shape, with dimensions typically ranging from 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dokdonella soli is closely related to other members of the genus Dokdonella, which are known to be found in various environmental samples such as soil and sediments.\n\nBiochemical and physiological characterization of Dokdonella soli has revealed that it is able to utilize a variety of carbon sources for growth, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids. The optimal growth temperature for this species is reported to be around 30°C.\n\nOverall, Dokdonella soli represents a soil-dwelling bacterium that contributes to the diversity and functioning of microbial communities in terrestrial ecosystems, though its specific ecological roles and interactions within the soil environment are still subject to further investigation.",
