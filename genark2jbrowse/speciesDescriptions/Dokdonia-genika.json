  "description": "Dokdonia genika is a species of bacterium that belongs to the genus Dokdonia. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Dokdonia genika was first isolated from seawater collected near Geoje Island, South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Dokdonia genika are rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum. They are oxidase and catalase positive, and can grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C. The bacterium is capable of hydrolyzing starch, gelatin, and Tween 80, but not cellulose or chitin.\n\nPhylogenetically, Dokdonia genika is closely related to other species within the genus Dokdonia, which are known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic matter in marine environments. The genome of Dokdonia genika has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and ecological roles in its natural habitat.",
