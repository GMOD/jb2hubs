  "description": "Donghicola eburneus is a species of marine bivalve mollusk in the family Donacidae, commonly known as bean clams or wedge clams. It is found in coastal areas of East Asia, primarily along the shores of China and Korea.\n\nSome key scientific characteristics of Donghicola eburneus:\n\n1. Shell morphology: The shell is small to medium-sized, typically less than 4 cm in length, with a smooth, white or ivory-colored surface.\n\n2. Anatomy: Like other bivalves, it has a pair of symmetrical shell valves connected by a hinge ligament. The foot is well-developed, allowing the clam to burrow into sandy or muddy substrates.\n\n3. Habitat and distribution: Donghicola eburneus is found in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones, living partially buried in sand or mud along coastlines in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\n4. Feeding and ecology: As a filter-feeding bivalve, Donghicola eburneus siphons in seawater to extract plankton and other suspended organic matter for nutrition.\n\n5. Reproduction: Donghicola eburneus is a dioecious species, with separate male and female individuals. It reproduces sexually, releasing sperm and eggs into the water column, where fertilization and larval development occur.\n\nThis species is ecologically important as a component of coastal benthic communities and may serve as a food source for various marine predators in its native range.",
