  "description": "Dongia soli is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the family Hyphomicrobiaceae.\n\nThe cells of Dongia soli are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are typically rod-shaped and motile, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\nDongia soli is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. The bacterium can tolerate a pH range of 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH of approximately 7.0-7.5.\n\nBiochemically, Dongia soli is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources. The bacterium is also known to possess catalase and oxidase activities.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dongia soli is closely related to other members of the genus Dongia, which are typically found in soil and freshwater environments.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential role in soil biogeochemical processes and its potential applications in bioremediation or agricultural practices, but further research is needed to fully understand its ecological and biotechnological significance.",
