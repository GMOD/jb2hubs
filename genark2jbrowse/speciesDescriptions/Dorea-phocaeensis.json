  "description": "Dorea phocaeensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Dorea. This species was originally isolated from the fecal sample of a human individual.\n\nDorea phocaeensis is a member of the Firmicutes phylum and the Lachnospiraceae family. It is a strictly anaerobic microorganism, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment to grow and thrive. The cells of D. phocaeensis are typically short, non-motile rods, measuring approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-3.0 μm in length.\n\nBiochemically, D. phocaeensis is able to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, producing short-chain fatty acids as the main end products of its metabolism. The bacterium has been found to be present in the human gut microbiome, where it may play a role in the overall intestinal ecosystem and potentially contribute to host health or disease.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance and potential clinical implications of this species within the human gut microbiome.",
