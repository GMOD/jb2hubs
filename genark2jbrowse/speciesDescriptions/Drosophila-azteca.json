  "description": "Drosophila azteca, commonly known as the Mexican fruit fly, is a species of small, two-winged fly belonging to the family Drosophilidae. This species is native to Mexico and Central America, where it is found in various habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as urban areas.\n\nDrosophila azteca is a member of the Drosophila genus, which is widely studied in the field of genetics and developmental biology due to its relatively simple genome, short life cycle, and ease of laboratory cultivation. The species is closely related to the more well-known Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, and shares many of its biological characteristics.\n\nThe adult Drosophila azteca is typically around 2-3 millimeters in length, with a slender body and a pair of transparent, membranous wings. The flies have red eyes and a yellowish-brown coloration, with distinct dark bands on their abdomen. Like other Drosophila species, they feed primarily on decaying or overripe fruit, where they lay their eggs.\n\nThe life cycle of Drosophila azteca follows a typical pattern for Drosophila flies, with the eggs hatching into larvae (commonly known as maggots) that undergo a series of molts before pupating and emerging as adult flies. The entire life cycle can be completed in as little as 10-14 days under optimal conditions, making this species a valuable model organism for scientific research.\n\nDrosophila azteca has been used in various studies, including investigations into evolutionary genetics, comparative genomics, and the mechanisms of insect development and behavior. Its small size, rapid reproduction, and genetic tractability make it a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes.",
