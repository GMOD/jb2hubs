  "description": "Drosophila bipectinata is a species of fruit fly (order Diptera) that belongs to the melanogaster species group within the genus Drosophila. It is a small, delicate fly with a body length typically ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 millimeters.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of D. bipectinata is the male's antennae, which are bipectinate, meaning they have a double row of branches or projections. This unique antennal structure is a key characteristic that distinguishes this species from other members of the melanogaster group.\n\nDrosophila bipectinata is primarily found in Southeast Asia, with a distribution that includes India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical habitats, often associated with decaying plant matter and rotting fruits, which serve as a food source and breeding substrate for the flies.\n\nAs a member of the Drosophila genus, D. bipectinata has been extensively studied as a model organism in the fields of genetics, developmental biology, and evolutionary biology. Its relatively short life cycle, well-understood genetics, and ease of laboratory culture have made it a valuable tool for scientific research.",
