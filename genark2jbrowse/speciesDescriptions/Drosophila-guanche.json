  "description": "Drosophila guanche is a species of fruit fly that belongs to the Drosophila genus. It is native to the Canary Islands, an archipelago located off the northwestern coast of Africa, belonging to Spain.\n\nDrosophila guanche is a small insect, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. It has a slender body, compound eyes, and a pair of membranous wings. The species is known to exhibit sexual dimorphism, where the males and females display distinct physical characteristics.\n\nGenetically, Drosophila guanche is closely related to other Drosophila species found in the Canary Islands, such as Drosophila buzzatii and Drosophila subobscura. It has been used as a model organism in evolutionary and ecological studies, particularly in understanding the genetic and behavioral adaptations of island-dwelling species.\n\nThe species is adapted to the subtropical climate of the Canary Islands and is often found in association with various plant species, utilizing them as a food source and breeding substrate. Drosophila guanche plays a role in the local ecosystem as a decomposer and pollinizer, contributing to the overall biodiversity of the Canary Islands.",
