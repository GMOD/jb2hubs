  "description": "Duganella zoogloeoides is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Betaproteobacteria class. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Duganella zoogloeoides is known for its ability to form zoogleal masses, which are colonies of cells embedded in a polysaccharide matrix.\n\nThe cells of Duganella zoogloeoides are typically rod-shaped, with dimensions ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 3.0 micrometers in length. They are motile, with the help of peritrichous flagella.\n\nDuganella zoogloeoides is found in various environments, including soil, water, and sewage treatment plants. It is known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic compounds and may play a role in nutrient cycling in natural ecosystems.\n\nThis species was first isolated and described in 1986 from a water sample collected in Germany. It is classified within the Duganella genus, which is part of the Oxalobacteraceae family.",
