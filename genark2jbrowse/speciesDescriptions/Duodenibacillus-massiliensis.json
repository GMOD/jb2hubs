  "description": "Duodenibacillus massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human duodenal biopsy sample. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Cells of Duodenibacillus massiliensis are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\nThe bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 37°C. Duodenibacillus massiliensis can tolerate a pH range of 6.0 to 8.5, with an optimal pH of 7.0-7.5 for growth.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Duodenibacillus massiliensis belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and is closely related to other members of the genus Duodenibacillus. The species was first described in 2016 and is considered a novel species within the genus.",
