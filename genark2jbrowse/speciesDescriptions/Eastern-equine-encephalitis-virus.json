  "description": "Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphavirus within the family Togaviridae. It is primarily transmitted by infected mosquitoes, particularly the Culiseta melanura species, and is considered one of the most deadly arboviruses in North America.\n\nEEEV primarily infects horses and humans, causing a severe and potentially fatal neurological disease known as Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The virus enters the host through a mosquito bite and can then cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to inflammation and damage to the central nervous system.\n\nSymptoms of EEE in humans typically include fever, headache, chills, and vomiting, which can progress to more severe neurological manifestations such as confusion, seizures, and coma. The case-fatality rate for EEE is estimated to be around 30%, making it one of the most lethal arboviral diseases in the United States.\n\nEffective treatment for EEEV infection is limited, and prevention relies primarily on mosquito control measures and personal protective actions, such as the use of insect repellents and avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity periods.",
