  "description": "Echeneis naucrates, commonly known as the whitefin sharksucker or slender suckerfish, is a species of remora found in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. It is a member of the family Echeneidae, a group of fishes characterized by the presence of a dorsal sucker-like disc on their heads.\n\nThe whitefin sharksucker is an elongated, laterally compressed fish with a streamlined body and a distinct sucker-like disc on the top of its head. This disc is composed of a series of parallel lamellae, which the fish uses to attach itself to larger marine animals, such as sharks, whales, and turtles, for transportation and to feed on parasites and scraps of food.\n\nThe whitefin sharksucker is typically grayish-brown in color, with a pale, whitish fin. It can grow up to 90 cm in length, but most individuals are smaller, usually around 50 cm. The species is widely distributed in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and is commonly found in coastal and offshore waters, often in association with its host species.\n\nThe whitefin sharksucker is an opportunistic feeder, consuming a variety of small fishes, crustaceans, and other marine organisms, as well as taking advantage of the scraps and parasites found on its host animals. It plays an important ecological role in marine ecosystems, acting as a cleaner and scavenger.",
