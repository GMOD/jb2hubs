  "description": "Echiichthys vipera, commonly known as the lesser weever or common weever, is a small species of venomous marine fish that belongs to the family Trachinidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, and the North Sea.\n\nThe lesser weever is a benthic fish, typically found buried in the sand or gravel on the seafloor, with only its eyes and the top of its head protruding above the substrate. It has a distinctive appearance, with a flattened, elongated body and a large, spiny dorsal fin that can deliver a painful sting from its venomous spines.\n\nThe lesser weever is a predatory fish, feeding on small crustaceans, fish, and other marine organisms. It is known for its ability to quickly bury itself in the substrate, making it a difficult target for predators. The species is also characterized by its nocturnal behavior, with the majority of its activities taking place at night.\n\nThe venom of the lesser weever is a complex mixture of compounds, including neurotoxins and cardiotoxins, which can cause severe pain, swelling, and other adverse reactions in humans who are stung. While the venom is not typically life-threatening, it can be a significant health concern for beachgoers and recreational fishermen who come into contact with the fish.",
