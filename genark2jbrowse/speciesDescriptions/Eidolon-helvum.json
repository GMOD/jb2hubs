  "description": "Eidolon helvum, commonly known as the straw-colored fruit bat or African yellow bat, is a species of megabat native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a large, fruit-eating bat with a wingspan that can reach up to 1.3 meters.\n\nEidolon helvum has a distinctive yellowish-brown fur coat, and its face is characterized by large eyes and pointed ears. These bats are highly social, living in large colonies that can number in the hundreds of thousands. They play an important ecological role as pollinators and seed dispersers for a variety of fruit-bearing plants.\n\nEidolon helvum is considered a keystone species in many African ecosystems, and their populations have been declining due to hunting, habitat loss, and urbanization. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this ecologically significant species.",
