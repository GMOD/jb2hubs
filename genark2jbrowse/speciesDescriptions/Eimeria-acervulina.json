  "description": "Eimeria acervulina is a species of protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It is an obligate intracellular parasite that primarily infects the intestinal epithelial cells of chickens, causing a disease known as coccidiosis.\n\nThe life cycle of Eimeria acervulina involves both sexual and asexual stages. The parasite reproduces within the host's intestinal cells, where it undergoes multiple rounds of asexual replication (schizogony) and eventually produces oocysts, which are the environmentally resistant, infective stage of the parasite.\n\nEimeria acervulina is one of the most common and economically significant species of Eimeria that affects poultry production. Infection with this parasite can lead to reduced feed efficiency, weight gain, and in severe cases, mortality in chickens. The disease is typically managed through a combination of prophylactic anticoccidial drugs, vaccination, and biosecurity measures in commercial poultry operations.",
