  "description": "Eimeria necatrix is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It is a causative agent of coccidiosis, a severe and often fatal disease in chickens and other poultry.\n\nThe life cycle of E. necatrix involves both sexual and asexual stages, which take place primarily in the intestinal tract of the host. The parasite enters the host through the ingestion of oocysts, which are the infective stage. Once inside the host, the oocysts release sporozoites that invade the intestinal cells, where they undergo asexual multiplication (schizogony) and sexual reproduction (gametogony).\n\nThe schizonts (asexual stage) and the gametes (sexual stage) eventually develop into oocysts, which are then shed in the host's feces. These oocysts can survive in the environment and become a source of infection for other susceptible hosts.\n\nE. necatrix is known to be highly pathogenic, causing significant damage to the intestinal epithelium and leading to severe diarrhea, hemorrhage, and even death in infected birds. The disease can have a significant economic impact on the poultry industry, as it can lead to decreased productivity, increased mortality, and the need for costly treatment and prevention measures.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and life cycle of E. necatrix is crucial for the development of effective control strategies and the implementation of appropriate management practices in poultry production.",
