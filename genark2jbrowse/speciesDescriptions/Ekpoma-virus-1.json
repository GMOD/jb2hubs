  "description": "Ekpoma virus 1 (EKPV-1) is a newly discovered virus that was first isolated from a rodent species in Ekpoma, Nigeria. It belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae, which includes a diverse group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses.\n\nThe Ekpoma virus 1 genome is approximately 11.5 kilobases in length and encodes the typical set of rhabdovirus structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that EKPV-1 is most closely related to other unclassified rhabdoviruses found in various mammalian hosts, including bats and rodents, across Africa and Asia. This suggests that EKPV-1 may have a broad host range and a wide geographic distribution.\n\nThe natural reservoir and transmission dynamics of EKPV-1 are not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its epidemiology, potential for zoonotic transmission, and any associated disease pathogenesis in both animal and human hosts.",
