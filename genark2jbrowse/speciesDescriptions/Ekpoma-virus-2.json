  "description": "Ekpoma virus 2 is a recently discovered virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It was first isolated from ticks collected in Ekpoma, Nigeria, in 2015. Ekpoma virus 2 is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is believed to be closely related to influenza viruses.\n\nThe genome of Ekpoma virus 2 consists of multiple segments, similar to the segmented genome structure of influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis has suggested that Ekpoma virus 2 may represent a new genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family, although its exact taxonomic classification is still under investigation.\n\nPreliminary studies have indicated that Ekpoma virus 2 can infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, and may have the potential to cause respiratory illness. However, the full extent of its host range, transmission dynamics, and pathogenicity is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to characterize this newly discovered virus.",
