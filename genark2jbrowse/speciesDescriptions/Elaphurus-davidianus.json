  "description": "Elaphurus davidianus, commonly known as the Père David's deer or the Milu, is a species of deer native to China. It is the sole extant member of the genus Elaphurus.\n\nPère David's deer is a medium-sized deer, standing around 120-150 cm tall at the shoulder. It has a distinctive appearance, with a long neck, a large, broad head, and large, spreading antlers. The fur is reddish-brown in color, with a pale belly and a dark stripe running along the back. The deer also has a unique adaptation in the form of partially webbed feet, which help it navigate the wetland habitats it prefers.\n\nHistorically, Père David's deer was found in the marshes and wetlands of central China. However, it became extinct in the wild due to overhunting and habitat loss in the late 19th century. The species was saved from extinction through captive breeding efforts, and today, it has been reintroduced to several protected areas in China, where it is classified as an endangered species.\n\nPère David's deer is an important part of the ecosystem, playing a role in the maintenance of wetland habitats. It is also culturally significant in China, where it has been revered and depicted in art and literature for centuries.",
