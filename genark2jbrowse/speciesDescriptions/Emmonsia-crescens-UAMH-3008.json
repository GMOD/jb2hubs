  "description": "Emmonsia crescens UAMH 3008 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Emmonsia. It is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it can exist in two different morphological forms, depending on the environmental conditions.\n\nThe species was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Alberta, Canada, and the strain UAMH 3008 is the reference strain for this species.\n\nEmmonsia crescens is classified as a thermally dimorphic fungus, as it can transition between a mold-like form at lower temperatures and a yeast-like form at higher temperatures, similar to the behavior of some pathogenic fungi such as Histoplasma and Blastomyces.\n\nIn the mold-like form, the fungus produces a white to tan-colored, cottony colony with aerial hyphae. In the yeast-like form, the cells are typically spherical or elliptical and can reproduce through budding.\n\nEmmonsia crescens is considered a saprophytic fungus, meaning it can survive and grow on dead or decaying organic matter in the environment. It is not known to be a primary human or animal pathogen, but it has been reported to cause rare, opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecology, biology, and potential medical relevance of this fungal species.",
