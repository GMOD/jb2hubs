  "description": "Emydura macquarii macquarii, commonly known as the Murray River turtle or the Murray short-necked turtle, is a freshwater turtle species endemic to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Chelidae, which includes side-necked turtles.\n\nThis subspecies of the Murray River turtle is characterized by its small to medium size, with a carapace (upper shell) length typically ranging from 13 to 25 centimeters. The carapace is oval-shaped and slightly domed, with a smooth surface and a grayish-brown coloration. The plastron (lower shell) is cream or yellowish in color.\n\nEmydura macquarii macquarii is an aquatic species that inhabits slow-moving rivers, lakes, and wetlands within the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, small invertebrates, and even carrion.\n\nThe Murray River turtle is known for its ability to retract its head and neck into its shell for protection, a characteristic of side-necked turtles. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a prey species for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its aquatic habitats.\n\nConservation efforts for this subspecies are ongoing, as it faces threats from habitat degradation, water pollution, and the introduction of invasive species.",
