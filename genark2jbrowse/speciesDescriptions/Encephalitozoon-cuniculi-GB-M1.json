  "description": "Encephalitozoon cuniculi GB-M1 is a species of microsporidian parasite that primarily infects rabbits and other small mammals. Microsporidians are a group of unicellular, spore-forming, obligate intracellular parasites that are classified as fungi.\n\nEncephalitozoon cuniculi GB-M1 is a small, oval-shaped spore with a characteristic polar tube that is used to inject the parasite's sporoplasm into the host cell. The parasite's life cycle involves both asexual and sexual reproduction, with the formation of thick-walled spores that are resistant to environmental conditions and can be transmitted between hosts.\n\nInfection with E. cuniculi GB-M1 can lead to a range of clinical symptoms in rabbits, including encephalitis, pneumonia, and kidney disease. The parasite is known to infect a variety of cell types, including epithelial cells, macrophages, and neurons.\n\nResearch on E. cuniculi GB-M1 has contributed to our understanding of the biology and evolution of microsporidian parasites, as well as their potential impact on animal and human health.",
