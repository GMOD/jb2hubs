  "description": "Encephalitozoon hellem ATCC 50504 is a species of microsporidia, a group of obligate intracellular parasites. It is a small, spore-forming, and unicellular eukaryotic organism.\n\nKey features of Encephalitozoon hellem ATCC 50504:\n\n1. Morphology:\n   - Spores are oval-shaped, approximately 1.5-2.5 Î¼m in size.\n   - Spores contain a distinctive polar tube, which is used to pierce the host cell membrane and inject the sporoplasm during infection.\n\n2. Life Cycle:\n   - Encephalitozoon hellem is an opportunistic pathogen that infects a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n   - The life cycle involves the proliferation of the parasite within the cytoplasm of the host cell, followed by the formation of mature spores that can infect new host cells.\n\n3. Pathogenesis:\n   - Encephalitozoon hellem is known to cause various clinical manifestations, such as keratoconjunctivitis, disseminated infections, and respiratory tract infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n4. Epidemiology:\n   - ATCC 50504 is a reference strain of Encephalitozoon hellem, which has been isolated and studied extensively in the laboratory setting.\n   - The species has a global distribution and has been reported in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.\n\n5. Taxonomy:\n   - Encephalitozoon hellem belongs to the phylum Microsporidia, class Microsporea, order Encephalitozoonida, and family Encephalitozoonidae.\n\nThis scientific description provides an overview of the key characteristics and relevant information about the Encephalitozoon hellem ATCC 50504 species, highlighting its morphology, life cycle, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and taxonomic classification.",
