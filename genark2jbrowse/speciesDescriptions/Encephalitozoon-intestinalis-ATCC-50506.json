  "description": "Encephalitozoon intestinalis ATCC 50506 is a microsporidian parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals. It is a small, obligate intracellular organism belonging to the phylum Microsporidia.\n\nMicrosporidians are spore-forming, eukaryotic organisms that lack mitochondria and have a unique infection mechanism involving a polar tube that injects the parasite's contents into the host cell. Encephalitozoon intestinalis is one of the most common microsporidian species found in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nThe spores of E. intestinalis are oval-shaped, approximately 1.5-2.5 Î¼m in size, and have a thick, resistant cell wall that allows them to survive in the environment. Upon ingestion, the spores germinate, and the infective stage, called the sporoplasm, is injected into the host cell, where it replicates and produces new spores.\n\nEncephalitozoon intestinalis is known to cause a disease called intestinal microsporidiosis, which can lead to chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting in immunocompromised individuals. Diagnosis typically involves the identification of the parasite's spores in stool samples or biopsy specimens using microscopic techniques or molecular methods, such as PCR.",
