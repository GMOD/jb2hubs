  "description": "Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Cardiovirus within the family Picornaviridae. This virus is known for its ability to infect a wide range of mammalian species, including rodents, pigs, and humans, although it is more commonly associated with disease in certain animal populations.\n\nThe EMCV genome consists of approximately 7.8 kilobases and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins. The virus primarily targets the heart and central nervous system, leading to the development of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in infected hosts.\n\nTransmission of EMCV typically occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, as well as through the consumption of contaminated food or water. The virus can also be transmitted vertically from infected mothers to their offspring.\n\nIn the laboratory, EMCV is commonly used as a model for studying the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and the host immune response to picornavirus infections. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying EMCV infection and its interactions with the host may contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for related viral diseases.",
