  "description": "Endocarpon pusillum is a species of crustose lichen found in various regions worldwide. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae within the order Verrucariales. Crustose lichens are characterized by a tightly attached, crust-like thallus that adheres closely to the substrate, often rocks or soil.\n\nThe thallus of E. pusillum is typically gray, greenish-gray, or brownish in color and can appear granular or minutely squamulose (covered in small, scale-like structures). The apothecia (reproductive structures) are black, small, and partially immersed within the thallus. The ascospores produced within the apothecia are typically simple, hyaline (clear), and ellipsoid in shape.\n\nE. pusillum is considered a cosmopolitan species, meaning it is widely distributed across different geographical regions and climates. It is often found growing on calcareous substrates, such as limestone or mortar, and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions, including relatively dry and exposed habitats.\n\nThe Z07020 designation likely refers to a specific genetic sequence or strain of this lichen species that has been studied and cataloged in a scientific database or collection.",
