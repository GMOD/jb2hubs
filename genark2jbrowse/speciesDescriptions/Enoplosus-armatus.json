  "description": "Enoplosus armatus, commonly known as the old wife or old salt, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Enoplosidae. It is native to the coastal waters of southern Australia, including the waters off New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia.\n\nEnoplosus armatus is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 30 centimeters. It has a compressed, laterally flattened body shape and a large, protruding mouth with an array of sharp teeth. The species is characterized by its distinctive armor-like scales that cover its body, which give it a unique and spiny appearance.\n\nEnoplosus armatus is a carnivorous fish that primarily feeds on small crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. It is commonly found in reef and rocky habitats, where it uses its camouflage and defensive spines to avoid predators. The species is known to form small schools and exhibit complex social behaviors, such as coordinated hunting strategies.\n\nDue to its distinctive appearance and limited distribution, Enoplosus armatus is of particular interest to marine biologists and ichthyologists studying the ecology and evolution of coastal marine ecosystems in southern Australia.",
