  "description": "Entamoeba histolytica DS4-868 is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a potentially severe human disease.\n\nEntamoeba histolytica DS4-868 is an anaerobic, unicellular eukaryotic organism that can exist in two main forms: the infectious cyst and the pathogenic trophozoite. The cyst form is the dormant, resistant stage that can survive outside the host, while the trophozoite is the active, disease-causing form that resides in the human intestine.\n\nThe DS4-868 strain of E. histolytica was isolated from a clinical sample and has been used in research to study the biology, genetics, and virulence factors of this important human parasite. Genomic analysis has revealed that this strain possesses a range of genes and molecular mechanisms that contribute to its pathogenicity, including those involved in tissue invasion, cytotoxicity, and evasion of the host immune response.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and molecular characteristics of E. histolytica DS4-868 is crucial for developing improved diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and preventive measures against amoebiasis, a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.",
