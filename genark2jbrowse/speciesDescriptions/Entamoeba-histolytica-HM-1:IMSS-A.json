  "description": "Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS-A is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a disease that can lead to severe gastrointestinal and extraintestinal complications in humans.\n\nThis particular strain, Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS-A, is a well-characterized and widely used laboratory isolate. It was originally obtained from a patient with amoebic dysentery in Mexico and has been extensively studied for its virulence, pathogenicity, and molecular characteristics.\n\nThe Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS-A strain is a unicellular eukaryotic organism that exists in two main forms: the infectious cyst and the invasive trophozoite. The cyst form is the infective stage, which can be transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Once inside the human host, the cysts excyst and release the trophozoites, which can then invade the intestinal mucosa and cause tissue damage.\n\nThis strain has been extensively used in laboratory studies to understand the pathogenesis of amoebiasis, the host-parasite interactions, and the development of potential treatment and prevention strategies. Its well-characterized genome and the availability of various genetic tools have made it a valuable model organism for amoebic research.",
