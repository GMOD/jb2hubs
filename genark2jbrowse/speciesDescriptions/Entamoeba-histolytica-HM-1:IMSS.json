  "description": "Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a major public health concern in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.\n\nEntamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS is a unicellular eukaryotic organism that exists in two main forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The trophozoite is the active, feeding stage of the parasite, which can invade the human intestinal mucosa and cause disease. The cyst is the dormant, infectious stage, which is responsible for the transmission of the parasite.\n\nThe HM-1:IMSS strain of E. histolytica is a widely studied and well-characterized isolate, which was originally obtained from a patient with dysentery in Mexico City, Mexico. This strain has been extensively used in laboratory research to understand the biology, pathogenesis, and host-parasite interactions of this important human pathogen.\n\nGenetically, the HM-1:IMSS strain has been shown to possess a complex and diverse genome, with a significant amount of genetic diversity within the species. This genetic variability is thought to contribute to the parasite's ability to adapt to different host environments and evade the host's immune response.\n\nOverall, Entamoeba histolytica HM-1:IMSS is a significant model organism for the study of amoebiasis and has played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of this important human disease.",
