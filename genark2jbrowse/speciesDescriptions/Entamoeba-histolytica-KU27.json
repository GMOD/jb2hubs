  "description": "Entamoeba histolytica is a species of protozoan parasite that is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a severe form of dysentery. The \"KU27\" strain refers to a specific isolate of E. histolytica that has been studied in the laboratory.\n\nE. histolytica KU27 is a single-celled, eukaryotic organism that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is an anaerobic parasite, meaning it can survive and reproduce in the absence of oxygen. The KU27 strain was isolated from a patient with dysentery and has been extensively studied to understand the biology, pathogenesis, and host-parasite interactions of this important human pathogen.\n\nKey features of E. histolytica KU27 include:\n- Trophozoite stage: The active, feeding form of the parasite that can invade the human intestinal mucosa and cause tissue damage.\n- Cyst stage: The dormant, environmentally resistant form that can be transmitted through contaminated food or water.\n- Virulence factors: The strain expresses various proteins and enzymes that contribute to its ability to cause disease, such as adhesins, cytolytic factors, and proteases.\n- Genetic diversity: E. histolytica is known to have genetic diversity, and the KU27 strain may possess unique genomic features compared to other isolates.\n\nResearch on the KU27 strain has provided valuable insights into the biology and pathogenesis of E. histolytica, contributing to our understanding of this important human parasite and the development of potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",
