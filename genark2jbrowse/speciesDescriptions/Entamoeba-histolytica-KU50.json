  "description": "Entamoeba histolytica KU50 is a species of protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is the causative agent of amoebiasis, a disease that can lead to severe gastrointestinal symptoms and, in some cases, liver abscesses.\n\nE. histolytica KU50 is a single-celled, anaerobic organism that can exist in two forms: the trophozoite (active, feeding form) and the cyst (dormant, infectious form). The trophozoites feed on host cells and can invade the intestinal lining, leading to tissue damage and the development of amoebic dysentery. The cysts are capable of surviving in the environment and can be transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\n\nThe genome of E. histolytica KU50 has been sequenced, providing insights into its biology, virulence factors, and potential targets for drug development. Ongoing research on this parasite aims to improve our understanding of its pathogenesis, epidemiology, and the development of effective treatment and preventive strategies against amoebiasis.",
