  "description": "Entelurus aequoreus, commonly known as the snake pipefish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to the Iberian Peninsula, and has also been reported in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe snake pipefish is a slender, elongated fish with a cylindrical body and a long, tubular snout. Its body is covered with a series of bony rings, giving it a segmented appearance. The fish can grow up to around 50 centimeters in length, although most individuals are typically smaller.\n\nEntelurus aequoreus is a predatory species, feeding primarily on small crustaceans, small fish, and other marine invertebrates. It uses its elongated snout to capture prey, which it sucks in by creating a strong suction force.\n\nThe snake pipefish is known for its unique reproductive behavior. Like other pipefish species, the male carries the eggs in a brood pouch until they hatch, a process that can take several weeks. The young pipefish hatch as miniature versions of the adults and undergo a gradual transformation as they grow.\n\nEntelurus aequoreus is considered a relatively common species within its geographic range, but its populations may be affected by habitat degradation and other environmental factors. It is not currently classified as a threatened or endangered species.",
