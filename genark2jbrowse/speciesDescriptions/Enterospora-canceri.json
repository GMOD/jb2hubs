  "description": "Enterospora canceri is a microsporidian parasite that infects the hepatopancreas (a digestive gland) of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), a common marine crustacean. Microsporidia are a group of obligate intracellular parasites that belong to the fungal kingdom.\n\nThe life cycle of E. canceri involves the formation of environmentally resistant spores that can infect the host crab. Once inside the host, the spores germinate and the parasite reproduces within the cells of the hepatopancreas, ultimately causing damage and dysfunction to this vital organ.\n\nE. canceri is known to reduce the growth, fecundity, and overall fitness of infected crabs, making it an important pathogen that can impact crab populations in coastal ecosystems. Studies on the biology, epidemiology, and host-parasite interactions of E. canceri contribute to our understanding of microsporidian parasites and their effects on crustacean hosts.",
