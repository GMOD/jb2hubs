  "description": "Enterovirus 5865/sin/000009 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Enteroviruses are known to infect a wide range of hosts, including humans, and can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild respiratory illnesses to more severe conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, and myocarditis.\n\nThe specific strain, Enterovirus 5865/sin/000009, was isolated from a clinical sample in Singapore. Genetic analysis of this virus has revealed its unique genomic features, which may provide insights into its potential pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics. However, further research is needed to fully understand the biological properties, epidemiology, and clinical significance of this particular enterovirus strain.",
