  "description": "Enterovirus A is a species of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. This species includes several well-known human pathogens, such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus A, and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71).\n\nEnterovirus A viruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 30 nanometers. Their genome consists of a single, linear RNA molecule of around 7,500 nucleotides in length, which encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into individual viral proteins necessary for the virus's replication and assembly.\n\nThese viruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract and can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including poliomyelitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and aseptic meningitis. Transmission typically occurs through the fecal-oral route or respiratory droplets. Enterovirus A infections are a significant public health concern, particularly in young children, and can lead to severe and potentially life-threatening complications in some cases.",
