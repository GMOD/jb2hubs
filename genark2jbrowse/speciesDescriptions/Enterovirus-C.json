  "description": "Enterovirus C is a species within the genus Enterovirus, which belongs to the family Picornaviridae. Enteroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nEnterovirus C includes several well-known human pathogens, such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus A. These viruses primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract and can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including poliomyelitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and viral meningitis.\n\nThe Enterovirus C species is characterized by its ability to replicate in the human intestinal tract and its potential to cause severe neurological complications. The viruses within this species have a distinct genetic makeup and capsid structure that differentiate them from other Enterovirus species.\n\nEnterovirus C viruses are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and their ability to persist in the environment and resist disinfection measures contributes to their public health significance. Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential impact of Enterovirus C infections is crucial for effective disease prevention and control strategies.",
