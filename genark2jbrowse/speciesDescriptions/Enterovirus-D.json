  "description": "Enterovirus D is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The Enterovirus D species includes several serotypes, such as Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which has gained attention in recent years due to its association with severe respiratory illness, particularly in children.\n\nStructurally, Enterovirus D virions are approximately 30 nanometers in diameter and possess an icosahedral capsid composed of four viral structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4). The viral genome, which ranges from approximately 7,200 to 7,500 nucleotides in length, encodes for various proteins responsible for viral replication, assembly, and host cell interaction.\n\nEnterovirus D viruses primarily target and replicate in the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but can also disseminate to other organs, leading to a range of clinical manifestations, including respiratory illnesses, neurological complications, and, in rare cases, severe and life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe epidemiology and transmission of Enterovirus D, particularly EV-D68, are not fully understood, but it is believed to spread through respiratory droplets, direct contact, and potentially through contaminated surfaces. Ongoing research continues to elucidate the molecular mechanisms, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of this emerging viral species.",
