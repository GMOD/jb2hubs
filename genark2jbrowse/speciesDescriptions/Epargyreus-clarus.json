  "description": "Epargyreus clarus, commonly known as the silver-spotted skipper, is a species of skipper butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae. It is widely distributed across North America, ranging from southern Canada to Central America.\n\nThe silver-spotted skipper is a medium-sized butterfly, with a wingspan of around 35-50 millimeters. The upper side of its wings is dark brown, with a distinctive silvery-white spot near the apex of the forewing. The underside of the hindwing is pale brown with a pattern of silvery-white spots, which gives the species its common name.\n\nThe larvae of the silver-spotted skipper feed on various legumes, including wisteria, tick trefoil, and soybean. The larvae construct shelters by webbing together leaves or other plant material, where they reside and feed.\n\nThe silver-spotted skipper is known for its rapid, erratic flight, which is characteristic of many skipper species. It is often found in open, grassy habitats, such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges, where its host plants are present.\n\nOverall, the silver-spotted skipper is a common and widely distributed species, playing a role in the ecosystem as a pollinator and a food source for various predators.",
