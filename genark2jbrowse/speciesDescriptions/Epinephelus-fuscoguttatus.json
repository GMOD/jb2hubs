It is a large, predatory fish that can grow up to 120 cm in length and weigh up to 60 kg.\n\nThe brown-marbled grouper is found in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian Islands and French Polynesia. It typically inhabits coral reef ecosystems and rocky areas at depths ranging from 5 to 100 meters.\n\nThis species has a robust, elongated body with a large, blunt head and a wide mouth. Its coloration is characterized by a brown or reddish-brown background with dark, irregular marbling patterns. The fins are also brown or reddish-brown in color.\n\nThe brown-marbled grouper is an ambush predator, feeding primarily on smaller fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It is an important commercial and recreational fishery species in many parts of its range, and is also commonly found in the aquarium trade.\n\nDue to its vulnerability to overfishing and habitat degradation, the brown-marbled grouper is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and various conservation efforts are in place to manage its populations.",
