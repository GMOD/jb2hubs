  "description": "Escherichia coli K-12 is a well-known strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a common inhabitant of the human and animal gastrointestinal tract. E. coli K-12 is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nE. coli K-12 is a non-pathogenic strain that has been extensively studied and used as a model organism in molecular biology and genetics research. It is commonly used in laboratory settings for a variety of purposes, such as gene cloning, protein expression, and the study of bacterial physiology and metabolism.\n\nThe K-12 strain of E. coli was first isolated in 1922 from the stool of a diphtheria patient in Palo Alto, California. Over the years, it has been extensively modified and studied, resulting in a well-characterized genome and a wide range of genetic tools and resources available for researchers.\n\nE. coli K-12 is known for its ability to grow rapidly in a variety of media and its ease of genetic manipulation. It has been widely used as a model system to understand fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, and regulation of gene expression.",
