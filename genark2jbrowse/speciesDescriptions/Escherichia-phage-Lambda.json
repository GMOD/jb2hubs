  "description": "Escherichia phage Lambda, also known as phage λ, is a bacteriophage that infects the common bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). It belongs to the family Siphoviridae, a group of tailed bacteriophages with a long, non-contractile tail.\n\nPhage λ is a temperate phage, meaning it can either enter a lytic cycle, where it replicates and lyses the host cell, or a lysogenic cycle, where it integrates its genetic material into the host's chromosome and remains dormant until induced to enter the lytic cycle.\n\nThe phage genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 48,500 base pairs. It encodes a variety of genes involved in host recognition, DNA replication, capsid assembly, and other functions necessary for the phage's life cycle.\n\nPhage λ has been extensively studied and is considered a model organism for understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral infection, gene regulation, and host-virus interactions. It has played a significant role in the development of genetic engineering techniques, such as the use of lambda vectors for cloning and DNA manipulation.\n\nThis phage has been widely used in research, teaching, and biotechnology applications, providing valuable insights into the fundamental processes of viral biology and their interactions with bacterial hosts.",
