  "description": "Eublepharis macularius, commonly known as the leopard gecko, is a species of nocturnal gecko native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan, India, Iran, and Pakistan. This species is known for its distinctive spotted pattern and its ability to shed its tail as a defense mechanism.\n\nLeopard geckos are small, ground-dwelling lizards that typically measure between 20-25 centimeters in length. They have a robust, stocky build and a broad, flattened head. Their skin is covered in small, granular scales, which can range in color from light tan to dark brown, with distinctive black or brown spots and blotches along their backs and tails.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of the leopard gecko is its ability to shed its tail when threatened or in response to a predator's attack. This process, known as autotomy, allows the gecko to break off its tail, which continues to twitch and distract the predator, while the gecko escapes unharmed.\n\nLeopard geckos are primarily nocturnal and spend much of their time hiding in crevices, burrows, or under rocks during the day. They are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of small insects, spiders, and other invertebrates. In the wild, they play an important role in the ecosystem by helping to control insect populations.\n\nEublepharis macularius is a popular pet species, known for its docile temperament, ease of care, and striking appearance. Due to its adaptability and widespread distribution, the leopard gecko is not considered to be a threatened species, and it is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
