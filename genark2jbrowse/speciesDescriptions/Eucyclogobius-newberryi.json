  "description": "Eucyclogobius newberryi, commonly known as the tidewater goby, is a small, benthic fish species that is endemic to the coastal wetlands of California, United States. It typically measures between 25-50 millimeters in length and is characterized by a rounded body, large eyes, and a flattened head.\n\nThe tidewater goby is found in brackish and freshwater habitats, including coastal lagoons, estuaries, and the lower reaches of streams and rivers. It prefers areas with slow-moving or still water and a substrate of sand or mud. The species is known to be highly tolerant of fluctuations in water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels.\n\nEucyclogobius newberryi is an important component of the coastal ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife. It plays a crucial role in the trophic dynamics of its habitat by consuming small invertebrates and detritus. The species is also known to exhibit parental care, with males guarding and protecting their nests and offspring.\n\nDue to habitat loss, fragmentation, and other anthropogenic impacts, the tidewater goby is listed as an endangered species under the United States Endangered Species Act. Conservation efforts focused on protecting and restoring its unique coastal wetland habitats are crucial for the long-term survival of this small, but ecologically significant fish.",
