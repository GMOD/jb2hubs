  "description": "Eufriesea mexicana is a species of orchid bee native to Mexico. It is a member of the genus Eufriesea, which is a group of stingless bees known for their complex courtship behaviors and their role in the pollination of orchids.\n\nEufriesea mexicana is a medium-sized bee, typically measuring around 15-20 millimeters in length. The bees have a distinctive metallic green or blue-green coloration on their thorax and abdomen, with some yellow or white markings. They have long, slender legs and antennae, which they use to navigate the complex floral structures of the orchids they pollinate.\n\nThese bees are important pollinators of various orchid species, playing a crucial role in the reproduction and maintenance of orchid populations. They use their long, specialized mouthparts to collect nectar and pollen from the orchid flowers, and in the process, they transfer pollen between individual plants, facilitating cross-pollination.\n\nEufriesea mexicana is found in various habitats throughout Mexico, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as areas with high densities of orchid plants. The species plays a significant role in the ecosystem, contributing to the overall biodiversity and the maintenance of healthy plant communities.",
