  "description": "European bat 1 lyssavirus (EBLV-1) is a member of the Lyssavirus genus within the Rhabdoviridae family. It is one of the several lyssavirus species that are known to infect bats in Europe.\n\nEBLV-1 is primarily found in two species of bats in Europe: the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) and the northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii). The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected bats, usually via bites or scratches.\n\nEBLV-1 can cause a fatal encephalitic disease in humans, similar to the more well-known rabies virus. However, human cases of EBLV-1 infection are relatively rare, with only a few documented cases reported.\n\nThe virus is capable of establishing persistent infections in bat populations, with bats often acting as asymptomatic carriers. This makes EBLV-1 an important public health concern, as it highlights the potential for zoonotic transmission from bats to humans.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance efforts aim to better understand the ecology, epidemiology, and potential public health risks associated with EBLV-1 and other bat-borne lyssaviruses in Europe.",
