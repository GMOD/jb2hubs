  "description": "Eurosta solidaginis, commonly known as the goldenrod gall fly, is a species of tephritid fly native to North America. It is a gall-forming insect, meaning it induces the formation of a specialized plant structure called a gall on the stems of goldenrod plants (Solidago spp.).\n\nThe adult fly is approximately 5-7 millimeters in length, with a yellow-brown body and transparent wings. The females lay their eggs on the stems of goldenrod plants, and the hatching larvae then feed on the plant tissue, causing the formation of a spherical, woody gall around them.\n\nThe gall serves as a protective and nutritive environment for the developing larva, which undergoes complete metamorphosis within the gall over the course of a year. The mature larva pupates inside the gall, and the adult fly emerges the following spring or summer, completing the life cycle.\n\nEurosta solidaginis is an important component of the goldenrod plant ecosystem, as its galls provide food and shelter for various other organisms, such as inquiline insects and parasitoid wasps. The species is also studied for its remarkable ability to withstand harsh winter conditions by entering a state of diapause (dormancy) within the gall.",
