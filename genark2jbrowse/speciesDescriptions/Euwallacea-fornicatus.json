  "description": "Euwallacea fornicatus, commonly known as the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), is a species of ambrosia beetle native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, cylindrical beetle measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length.\n\nThe key features of E. fornicatus are:\n\n1. Morphology: The beetle has a dark brown to black colored body with antennae and legs. It has a cylindrical, elongated shape typical of ambrosia beetles.\n\n2. Feeding Behavior: E. fornicatus is a wood-boring insect that feeds on the fungus it cultivates within the tree's vascular system. The female beetle burrows into the tree trunk and branches, creating galleries where it inoculates the wood with the fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, which the beetles feed on.\n\n3. Host Range: The polyphagous shot hole borer is considered a highly invasive pest with a wide host range, attacking over 300 different tree species, including avocado, oak, sycamore, and many others.\n\n4. Ecological Impact: The damage caused by the beetle's feeding and the associated fungal infection can lead to the decline and eventual death of the infested trees, posing a significant threat to urban forests, agricultural crops, and natural ecosystems.\n\n5. Geographic Distribution: The PSHB is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced and established in various regions, including parts of the United States, Israel, and South America, where it continues to cause considerable economic and ecological damage.",
