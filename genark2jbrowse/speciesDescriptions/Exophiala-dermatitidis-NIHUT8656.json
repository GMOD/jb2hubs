  "description": "Exophiala dermatitidis NIH/UT8656 is a species of fungus belonging to the genus Exophiala. It is a black yeast-like fungus that is known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous infections in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThis specific strain, NIH/UT8656, was isolated from a clinical sample and has been extensively studied in the laboratory. It is characterized by its ability to grow at a wide range of temperatures, including human body temperature, and its production of melanin, which contributes to its dark pigmentation.\n\nExophiala dermatitidis is considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause disease in individuals with weakened immune systems or other underlying health conditions. Infections caused by this fungus can range from superficial skin lesions to more severe, disseminated infections affecting internal organs.\n\nThe genome of Exophiala dermatitidis NIH/UT8656 has been sequenced, providing insights into its biology, potential virulence factors, and adaptations that allow it to thrive in the human host. This information has been valuable for understanding the epidemiology, diagnosis, and potential treatment strategies for infections caused by this fungal species.",
