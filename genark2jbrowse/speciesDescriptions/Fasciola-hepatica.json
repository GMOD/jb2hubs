  "description": "Fasciola hepatica, commonly known as the common liver fluke or sheep liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode (flatworm) that primarily infects the liver of various mammalian hosts, including humans, sheep, cattle, and other herbivores.\n\nThis species belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and the class Trematoda. Fasciola hepatica has a complex life cycle, involving both aquatic and terrestrial stages. The adult worms reside in the bile ducts of the host's liver, where they feed on the host's blood and tissue fluids.\n\nThe adult F. hepatica is a leaf-shaped, hermaphroditic worm, typically measuring 2-4 cm in length and 1-2 cm in width. It has a distinctive conical anterior end and a broader, flatter posterior end. The parasite's body is covered with a tegument, which is a protective and absorptive layer that helps it evade the host's immune response.\n\nThe life cycle of F. hepatica involves several intermediate hosts, including freshwater snails of the genus Galba (formerly Lymnaea). The eggs released by the adult worms in the host's bile ducts are passed out with the feces, where they hatch into free-swimming larval stages called miracidia. The miracidia then infect the snail intermediate host, where they undergo asexual reproduction and develop into cercariae, which are the infective stage that can penetrate the skin of the definitive host.\n\nInfection with F. hepatica, known as fascioliasis, can cause significant health problems in both animals and humans, including liver damage, bile duct obstruction, and other gastrointestinal issues. Diagnosis and treatment of fascioliasis typically involve the use of specialized diagnostic techniques and antiparasitic medications.",
