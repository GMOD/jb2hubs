  "description": "The Fathead Minnow Calicivirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family, a group of non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. This virus specifically infects the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), a small freshwater fish species commonly found in North American lakes and rivers.\n\nThe Fathead Minnow Calicivirus is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in fathead minnow populations, posing a threat to the overall ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems where this fish species is present. The virus primarily targets the gastrointestinal tract of the host, leading to symptoms such as lethargy, loss of appetite, and eventual death in severe cases.\n\nResearch on the Fathead Minnow Calicivirus is ongoing, as scientists aim to better understand its molecular structure, modes of transmission, and potential impact on aquatic biodiversity. Understanding the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this virus is crucial for developing effective management strategies to mitigate its effects on fathead minnow populations and the broader aquatic communities they support.",
