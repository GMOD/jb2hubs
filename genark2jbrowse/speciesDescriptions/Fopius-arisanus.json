  "description": "Fopius arisanus is a species of parasitic wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is a biological control agent that is widely used for the management of fruit fly pests, particularly the Oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis) and the melon fly (Bactrocera cucurbitae).\n\nFopius arisanus is a small wasp, typically measuring around 3-4 millimeters in length. It is black in color with some yellow or orange markings on its abdomen. The female wasp has a long, slender ovipositor that it uses to lay its eggs inside the eggs or larvae of the target fruit fly species.\n\nThe life cycle of Fopius arisanus is closely linked to that of its host fruit fly. The female wasp detects the presence of fruit fly eggs or larvae and deposits its own eggs inside them. The wasp larvae then develop within the host, feeding on the fruit fly's tissues and eventually emerging as adult wasps, which then continue the cycle.\n\nFopius arisanus is an important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs targeting fruit fly pests. Its ability to effectively parasitize and suppress fruit fly populations makes it a valuable tool for sustainable and environmentally-friendly pest control in various agricultural settings.",
