  "description": "Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida D9876 is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively intracellular bacterial subspecies that belongs to the genus Francisella. It is considered a less virulent subspecies compared to the more pathogenic F. tularensis subsp. tularensis, which is the causative agent of the serious infectious disease tularemia in humans and other mammals.\n\nThe D9876 strain of F. tularensis subsp. novicida is a laboratory isolate that has been used in various research studies. It is genetically distinct from the more common F. tularensis subsp. novicida strains and may exhibit slightly different phenotypic characteristics and virulence properties. However, like other F. tularensis subsp. novicida strains, it is generally considered less pathogenic to humans compared to the Type A and Type B subspecies of F. tularensis.\n\nFrancisella species are known for their ability to survive and replicate within host phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, which contributes to their virulence. The study of less virulent strains like F. tularensis subsp. novicida D9876 can provide valuable insights into the complex pathogenesis of Francisella infections and help advance our understanding of this important group of bacterial pathogens.",
