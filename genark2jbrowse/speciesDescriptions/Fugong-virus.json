  "description": "Fugong virus is a newly discovered virus that was first isolated from rodents in Fugong County, Yunnan Province, China in 2018. It belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the Hantaviridae family.\n\nHantaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodent urine, feces, or saliva. Fugong virus is believed to be carried by certain rodent species native to the Yunnan region, though the specific reservoir host has not yet been conclusively identified.\n\nGenetic analysis has shown that Fugong virus is a distinct hantavirus species, with a genome structure and phylogenetic placement that is unique compared to other known hantaviruses. Further research is still needed to fully characterize the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and potential public health significance of this newly discovered virus.",
