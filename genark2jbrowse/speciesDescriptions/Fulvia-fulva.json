  "description": "Fulvia fulva, commonly known as the brown-banded cockroach, is a species of cockroach found in various parts of the world. It belongs to the family Blattidae and is native to Asia, particularly Southeast Asia.\n\nPhysically, Fulvia fulva is a small to medium-sized cockroach, typically measuring between 10-15 millimeters in length. Its body is oval-shaped and flattened, with a light to dark brown coloration. The most distinctive feature of this species is the presence of two dark brown bands across the dorsal surface of the abdomen, which gives it its common name.\n\nFulvia fulva is primarily a nocturnal insect and is known to be a common household pest, often found in kitchens, bathrooms, and other damp areas of buildings. It feeds on a variety of organic materials, including food scraps, paper, and even the glue in book bindings.\n\nThe species has a relatively short lifespan, with adults living for approximately 6-12 months. Females can produce several broods of eggs during their lifetime, with each ootheca (egg case) containing around 16-40 eggs. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which undergo multiple molts before reaching adulthood.\n\nFulvia fulva is considered a cosmopolitan species and has been reported in various parts of the world, including Europe, North America, and Australia, often transported inadvertently through international trade and travel.",
