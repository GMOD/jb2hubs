The coloration of the Alaska pollock is typically olive-green or gray-green on the back, fading to a lighter, silvery-white on the belly.\n\nThis species is a pelagic, schooling fish that primarily feeds on small crustaceans, such as krill and copepods, as well as small fish. The Alaska pollock is an important component of the marine ecosystem, serving as a key prey species for a variety of predators, including whales, seals, and seabirds.\n\nCommercially, the Alaska pollock is one of the most heavily harvested fish species in the world, with a global annual catch of over 3 million metric tons. It is a valuable fishery resource, primarily used for the production of surimi (a processed fish product) and other seafood products.\n\nConservation efforts for the Alaska pollock involve carefully managed catch quotas and regulations to ensure the sustainability of the fishery. Overall, the Alaska pollock is a significant and ecologically important species in the North Pacific Ocean.",
