  "description": "Galemys pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean desman, is a small, semi-aquatic mammal species found in the Pyrenees Mountains, which span the border between France and Spain. It is the only surviving member of the Desmaninae subfamily, which was once more widely distributed across Europe.\n\nThe Pyrenean desman is a highly specialized insectivore, with a long, flexible snout and webbed feet adapted for foraging in fast-flowing mountain streams and rivers. It has a cylindrical body, short legs, and a long, scaly tail that aids in swimming and maneuvering through the water.\n\nThese nocturnal, solitary animals feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates, such as caddisfly larvae, mayfly nymphs, and small crustaceans. They use their sensitive snout to detect prey and their powerful forelimbs to capture and manipulate food items.\n\nGalemys pyrenaicus is a threatened species, with a declining population due to habitat loss, water pollution, and climate change impacts on its specialized aquatic environment. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and ecologically important member of the Pyrenean mountain ecosystem.",
