Their diet consists of a wide range of aquatic plants, insects, crustaceans, and small vertebrates.\n\nMoorhens are known for their unique courtship behavior, which involves elaborate displays and vocalizations. They are also known for their aggressive territorial defense, often chasing away other birds and even small mammals that encroach on their breeding grounds.\n\nOverall, the common moorhen is a widespread and adaptable species that plays an important role in the ecological balance of freshwater ecosystems.",
