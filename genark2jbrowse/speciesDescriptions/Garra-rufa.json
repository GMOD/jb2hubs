  "description": "Garra rufa, commonly known as the doctor fish or nibble fish, is a small freshwater fish species that belongs to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to the Middle East, specifically in the rivers and streams of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nThe Garra rufa is a small, bottom-dwelling fish that typically grows to a maximum length of around 10 cm (4 inches). It has a distinctive sucker-like mouth that it uses to graze on algae and other organic matter from rocks and aquatic vegetation. The fish's body is typically brown or gray in color, with a flat, streamlined shape that helps it navigate the fast-moving currents of its natural habitat.\n\nOne of the unique features of the Garra rufa is its ability to feed on the dead skin of humans, a property that has led to its use in a form of skin therapy known as \"fish pedicures\" or \"doctor fish treatments.\" In these treatments, the fish are used to remove dead or damaged skin from the feet and hands of human patients, which can help alleviate conditions such as psoriasis and eczema.\n\nOverall, the Garra rufa is an interesting and unique species that has found a niche in both natural ecosystems and in the realm of human skin care and therapy.",
