  "description": "Gastrolobium bilobum, also known as the heart-leaf poison pea or heart-leaved poison, is a species of shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which is a large family of flowering plants commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family.\n\nThe species is characterized by its bilobed (two-lobed) leaves, which are a distinctive feature. The leaves are typically green in color and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are yellow in color.\n\nGastrolobium bilobum is known to be highly toxic to livestock, particularly sheep and cattle, due to the presence of various alkaloids and other toxic compounds in its foliage. Ingestion of the plant can lead to severe poisoning and even death in affected animals. As a result, it is considered a significant agricultural pest in regions where it is found.\n\nThe species is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean-like climate of Western Australia and is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats. It plays a role in the local ecosystem, but its toxicity makes it a challenging species to manage in areas where livestock farming is prevalent.",
