  "description": "Gastrophryne carolinensis, commonly known as the Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad, is a small amphibian species belonging to the family Microhylidae. It is native to the southeastern United States, primarily found in areas ranging from eastern Texas to the Carolinas and Florida.\n\nThis species is characterized by its distinctive narrow, pointed snout and relatively small size, typically measuring between 2.5 to 4.5 centimeters in length. The body is stocky and the skin is smooth, often with a grayish or brownish coloration that helps it blend into its natural habitat.\n\nGastrophryne carolinensis is a nocturnal, terrestrial species that primarily inhabits moist, wooded areas, such as forests, swamps, and wetlands. It feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and mites.\n\nReproduction in this species involves the males calling during the breeding season, which typically occurs in the spring and early summer. Females lay their eggs in temporary pools or slow-moving water, where the tadpoles develop and metamorphose into adult frogs.\n\nThe Eastern Narrow-mouthed Toad is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and generally stable population. However, habitat loss and degradation can pose threats to local populations in some areas.",
