  "description": "Geospiza fortis, commonly known as the medium ground finch, is a species of bird belonging to the Darwin's finch group found in the Galápagos Islands. It is a small, seed-eating bird with a strong, conical beak adapted for cracking open hard seeds.\n\nThe medium ground finch is a member of the family Thraupidae and is closely related to other Darwin's finch species found in the Galápagos. It is characterized by its medium-sized beak and body size, which is intermediate between the small ground finch (Geospiza fuliginosa) and the large ground finch (Geospiza magnirostris).\n\nThe medium ground finch plays an important role in the ecosystem of the Galápagos Islands, where it is involved in the complex food web and helps to shape the distribution and abundance of plant species through its seed-eating behavior. It is also a subject of extensive study in evolutionary biology, as its beak morphology and foraging behavior have been shown to be influenced by environmental factors and natural selection.",
