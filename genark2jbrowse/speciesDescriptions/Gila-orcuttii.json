  "description": "Gila orcuttii, commonly known as the Orcutt's desert tortoise, is a species of tortoise native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the genus Gopherus, which includes several species of North American tortoises.\n\nThe Orcutt's desert tortoise is a medium-sized tortoise, typically reaching a carapace length of 25-35 cm. Its shell is domed and has a pale yellowish-brown or grayish-brown color. The plastron, or underside of the shell, is also pale in color. The head, legs, and tail are dark brown or black in color.\n\nThese tortoises are adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, where they rely on burrows and other shelters to escape the extreme temperatures. They are herbivorous, feeding on a variety of desert plants, including grasses, forbs, and cacti.\n\nOrcutt's desert tortoise is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss, predation, and other human-related impacts. Conservation efforts aim to protect and manage the remaining populations of this unique desert-dwelling reptile.",
