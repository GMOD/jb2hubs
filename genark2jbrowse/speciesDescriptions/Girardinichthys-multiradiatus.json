  "description": "Girardinichthys multiradiatus is a small freshwater fish species that belongs to the family Goodeidae, which is endemic to central Mexico. It is commonly known as the Lerma multiradiatus or the Lerma splitfin.\n\nThe species is characterized by a laterally compressed body with a large, terminal mouth. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 7-8 centimeters (2.8-3.1 inches). Girardinichthys multiradiatus has a distinctive coloration, with a dark brown or olive-green back, and a lighter, yellowish-orange belly.\n\nThis species is primarily found in the Lerma River basin, which is located in the central highlands of Mexico. It inhabits slow-moving, shallow waters, such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving sections of rivers and streams. Girardinichthys multiradiatus is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, algae, and small invertebrates.\n\nThe species is considered threatened due to habitat loss, water pollution, and the introduction of non-native species in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endemic Mexican fish species.",
