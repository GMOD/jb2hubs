  "description": "Glaucopsyche alexis, commonly known as the green-underside blue, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is a small to medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan ranging from 24 to 34 millimeters.\n\nThe upper side of the wings of Glaucopsyche alexis is typically a bluish-gray color, with dark veins and a distinct dark border. The underside of the wings is a distinctive green-gray color, with a pattern of small white spots and markings.\n\nThe larvae of Glaucopsyche alexis feed on the flowers and foliage of various legume plants, such as vetches and trefoils. The larvae are known to have a symbiotic relationship with certain species of ants, which protect the larvae in exchange for a sweet secretion produced by the larvae.\n\nGlaucopsyche alexis is found in various parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, as well as in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. The species is generally considered to be widespread and relatively common within its range, although it may be threatened by habitat loss and degradation in some areas.",
