  "description": "Glis glis, commonly known as the edible dormouse or fat dormouse, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Gliridae. It is a small, stocky, and round-bodied animal with large eyes, rounded ears, and a long, bushy tail.\n\nThe Glis glis is native to Europe, found in various parts of the continent, including parts of Scandinavia, Central Europe, and the Mediterranean region. It is an arboreal species, spending most of its time in the canopy of deciduous and mixed forests, where it forages for food and constructs its nests.\n\nThese dormice are primarily nocturnal and hibernate during the winter months, entering a state of torpor to conserve energy. They are excellent climbers and use their strong claws and prehensile tail to move easily through the trees. Their diet consists of a variety of plant materials, such as nuts, seeds, fruits, and even small invertebrates.\n\nGlis glis is known for its ability to store fat during the active season, which it then uses to sustain itself during hibernation. This adaptation allows the species to survive the harsh winter conditions in its native habitat. The species is considered a pest in some areas due to its potential to damage crops and orchards, leading to management efforts in certain regions.",
