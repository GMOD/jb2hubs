  "description": "Glycine soja, also known as the wild soybean, is a species of legume native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a wild relative of the cultivated soybean (Glycine max), and they belong to the same genus, Glycine.\n\nGlycine soja is a trailing or climbing annual vine, growing up to 3 meters in length. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate in shape. The flowers are small, yellow, and borne in clusters. The pods are oblong and contain 2-4 small, round, brown seeds.\n\nCompared to the cultivated soybean, Glycine soja is generally more resistant to pests and diseases, and can grow in a wider range of environmental conditions, including poor soil and drought-prone areas. It is considered a valuable genetic resource for soybean breeding and improvement, as it harbors a diversity of traits that can be introgressed into cultivated soybean to enhance its adaptability and productivity.\n\nGlycine soja plays an important role in the natural ecosystems of its native range, serving as a food source for various wildlife species and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region.",
