  "description": "Gobius niger, commonly known as the black goby, is a small benthic fish species belonging to the family Gobiidae. It is found in coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to Senegal, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe black goby is a small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 15 centimeters. It has a robust, elongated body with a large, flattened head and eyes that are positioned on the top of the head. The coloration of the species is variable, ranging from dark brown or black to olive-green, with darker vertical bars or blotches along the sides.\n\nGobius niger is a bottom-dwelling species, typically found in rocky, sandy, or muddy habitats, often in close association with crevices, caves, or man-made structures, such as piers or breakwaters. It is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish.\n\nThe species is known for its territorial behavior and the ability of the males to construct elaborate nests, often in small crevices or under rocks, where they attract and court females for spawning. The females deposit their eggs within the nest, which the males then guard and aerate until the larvae hatch.\n\nGobius niger plays a role in the ecology of coastal marine ecosystems, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and other marine organisms. It is also of interest to researchers due to its adaptations to the benthic environment and its reproductive behaviors.",
