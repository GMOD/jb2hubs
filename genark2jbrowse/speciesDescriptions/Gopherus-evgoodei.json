  "description": "Gopherus evgoodei, commonly known as the Sonoran desert tortoise, is a species of tortoise found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the genus Gopherus, which includes several species of North American tortoises.\n\nThe Sonoran desert tortoise is a medium-sized tortoise, typically measuring between 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) in carapace length. Its shell is domed and typically brown or grayish-brown in color, with a well-developed plastron (lower shell) that is often yellow or tan. The species has sturdy, elephantine-like limbs and a long neck that it can retract into its shell for protection.\n\nGopherus evgoodei is adapted to the harsh, arid environment of the Sonoran Desert, where it spends much of its time in underground burrows or rock crevices to escape the extreme temperatures. It is primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of desert plants, including grasses, succulents, and forbs.\n\nThe Sonoran desert tortoise is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and human-related threats such as vehicle collisions and collection for the pet trade. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and management, are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique desert-dwelling tortoise.",
