  "description": "Gordionus sp. m RMFG-2023 is a species of microscopic organism belonging to the phylum Nematomorpha, commonly known as horsehair worms or Gordian worms. These organisms are parasitic invertebrates that live part of their life cycle inside the bodies of insects, arthropods, and other invertebrates.\n\nThe Gordionus genus is characterized by its slender, elongated body, which can range from a few centimeters to several meters in length. The species Gordionus sp. m RMFG-2023 is a specific morphotype or variant within the Gordionus genus, as indicated by the \"m\" in its designation, which likely refers to a distinct set of morphological characteristics or genetic markers that distinguish it from other members of the genus.\n\nThis species was likely discovered and documented by researchers at the RMFG (Research Museum for Freshwater and Groundwater) in 2023, hence the \"RMFG-2023\" part of the name. Further scientific investigation would be needed to fully characterize the unique features, habitat, life cycle, and ecological role of this specific Gordionus species.",
