  "description": "Gossypium arboreum, commonly known as the tree cotton or Asiatic cotton, is a species of cotton plant that is native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height.\n\nThe plant has a woody stem and branches, with alternate, lobed leaves that are green in color. The flowers are yellow with a red center and are produced in clusters. The fruit of the plant is a capsule, known as a cotton boll, which contains the cotton fibers.\n\nGossypium arboreum is considered one of the oldest cultivated cotton species, with evidence of its domestication dating back to around 3000 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization. It is known for its long, silky fibers that have been used for textile production in the region for centuries.\n\nCompared to other cotton species, Gossypium arboreum is more drought-tolerant and can grow in a variety of soil types. It has played a significant role in the economic and cultural history of the Indian subcontinent and continues to be an important crop in some regions.",
