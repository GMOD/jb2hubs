It belongs to the family Didelphidae, which includes various species of opossums.\n\nThe agile gracile opossum is a small, slender-bodied animal with a long, pointed snout and large, rounded ears. Its fur is typically grayish or brownish in color, and it has a prehensile tail that it uses for climbing and balance. The species is known for its agility and ability to move quickly through the forest canopy.\n\nGracilinanus agilis is primarily arboreal, spending most of its time in the trees and shrubs of its habitat. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of insects, small vertebrates, fruits, and seeds. The species is found in various forest types, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as in more open, scrubby areas.\n\nReproduction in G. agilis involves a gestation period of approximately 12-13 days, followed by the birth of small, underdeveloped young that complete their development while attached to the mother's teats. The species is known to be relatively solitary, with individuals maintaining their own territories.\n\nConservation-wise, the agile gracile opossum is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is relatively adaptable to habitat changes.",
