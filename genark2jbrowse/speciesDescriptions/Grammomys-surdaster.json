It has a dense, soft fur coat that ranges in color from dark brown to reddish-brown. The species is characterized by its large, rounded ears and a distinctive white spot at the base of each ear.\n\nGrammomys surdaster is primarily nocturnal and arboreal, living in dense thickets, bushes, and forests. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of plant materials, insects, and small invertebrates. The species is known to be a skilled climber and builds its nests in the branches of trees or shrubs.\n\nThe woodland thicket rat is considered a common and widespread species within its natural range.
