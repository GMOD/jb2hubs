  "description": "Grampus griseus, commonly known as the Risso's dolphin, is a species of cetacean belonging to the family Delphinidae. It is a medium-sized dolphin, typically measuring between 3.5 to 4.5 meters in length and weighing up to 500 kilograms.\n\nRisso's dolphins are characterized by their robust, rounded bodies and a short, blunt beak. They have a distinctive coloration pattern, with a dark gray to black upper body that fades to a lighter gray or white on the underside. Their skin often becomes progressively whiter with age, due to the accumulation of scars and scratches.\n\nThese dolphins are primarily found in temperate and subtropical waters around the world, including the Mediterranean Sea, the North Atlantic Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. They are usually observed in small, stable social groups, often in association with other cetacean species.\n\nRisso's dolphins are known to be primarily piscivorous, feeding on a variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. They employ a unique hunting strategy, using their sharp teeth to grasp and tear their prey.\n\nThe conservation status of Grampus griseus is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although they may face threats from human activities such as bycatch, pollution, and climate change.",
