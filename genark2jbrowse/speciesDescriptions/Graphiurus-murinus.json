  "description": "Graphiurus murinus, commonly known as the African Dormouse or Dwarf Dormouse, is a small rodent species that belongs to the family Gliridae. These dormice are native to various regions of Africa, including parts of Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of North Africa.\n\nThe Graphiurus murinus is a small, nocturnal mammal with a rounded body, large eyes, and a long, bushy tail. They typically weigh between 15-35 grams and have a head-body length of around 7-10 centimeters. Their fur is soft and can range in color from reddish-brown to grey.\n\nThese dormice are arboreal, meaning they live primarily in trees and are well-adapted for climbing. They are known to be excellent jumpers and gliders, using their tails for balance and maneuvering. Graphiurus murinus are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods such as nuts, seeds, fruits, and insects.\n\nDuring the winter months or periods of food scarcity, the African Dormouse enters a state of torpor, a form of hibernation, to conserve energy. They build nests in tree cavities, abandoned bird nests, or other suitable sheltered areas.\n\nThe Graphiurus murinus is generally considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as they have a relatively wide distribution and are not currently facing major threats to their population.",
