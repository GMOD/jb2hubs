  "description": "The Great Island virus (GIV) is a member of the Nairovirus genus, which belongs to the Bunyaviridae family. It is an arthropod-borne virus, primarily transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus.\n\nGIV was first isolated in 1967 from Ixodes uriae ticks collected from seabird colonies on Great Island, off the coast of Ireland. It has since been detected in various locations across Europe, Asia, and North America, typically in association with seabird habitats.\n\nThe virus particle is spherical in shape, approximately 90-100 nanometers in diameter, and contains a segmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. The genome consists of three segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, the glycoproteins, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively.\n\nGIV is primarily maintained in nature through a tick-seabird transmission cycle, with seabirds serving as the primary reservoir hosts. Infection in humans is rare but can occur, typically resulting in a mild, self-limiting illness characterized by fever, headache, and fatigue.\n\nThe significance of GIV lies in its potential as an emerging zoonotic pathogen and its possible role in the ecology of seabird populations. Continued surveillance and research on this virus are important for understanding its epidemiology, host-virus interactions, and potential public health implications.",
