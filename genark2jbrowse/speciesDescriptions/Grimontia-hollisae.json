  "description": "Grimontia hollisae is a species of Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Vibrionaceae. It is a halophilic (salt-loving) bacterium, which means it requires a saline environment to grow and thrive.\n\nThe cells of G. hollisae are typically 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.5-3.0 μm long, and they possess a single polar flagellum for motility. The bacterium is oxidase-positive and can reduce nitrate to nitrite.\n\nG. hollisae is found primarily in marine and estuarine environments, where it can be isolated from seawater, sediments, and various marine organisms, such as shellfish. It has been reported to cause gastroenteritis and septicemia in humans, particularly in individuals with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe genome of G. hollisae has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, virulence factors, and evolutionary relationships within the Vibrionaceae family.",
