  "description": "Guaruba guarouba, commonly known as the golden parakeet or Peruvia parrot, is a species of parrot native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is a member of the family Psittacidae and the genus Guaruba.\n\nThe golden parakeet is a medium-sized parrot, measuring approximately 30-35 cm in length. Its plumage is predominantly bright golden-yellow in color, with a greenish-yellow head and blue flight feathers. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males typically having brighter and more vibrant plumage compared to females.\n\nThese parrots are primarily found in the lowland tropical forests and gallery forests of the Amazon basin. They are highly social birds, often seen in small flocks or pairs, and are known for their distinctive, high-pitched, whistling calls.\n\nThe golden parakeet's diet consists mainly of seeds, fruits, and nuts, which it forages for in the canopy and understory of the forest. The species is known to play an important role in seed dispersal, contributing to the regeneration of the Amazon ecosystem.\n\nDue to habitat loss, illegal pet trade, and hunting, the golden parakeet is classified as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and captive breeding programs, are crucial for the long-term survival of this vibrant and ecologically significant parrot species.",
