Gyroviruses are a genus of small DNA viruses that infect various animal species, but without access to scientific literature or databases, I cannot confidently comment on the characteristics, host, or other details of this particular gyrovirus strain. Gyroviruses are an area of ongoing research, and more comprehensive information would be needed to give a substantive scientific overview of Gyrovirus Tu789 specifically. My apologies, but I do not have the required knowledge to generate a reliable short scientific description for this specific virus species.",
