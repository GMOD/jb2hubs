  "description": "Haliaeetus albicilla, commonly known as the white-tailed eagle or the gray sea eagle, is a large bird of prey species belonging to the genus Haliaeetus, which includes several species of sea eagles.\n\nThe white-tailed eagle is a large raptor, with a wingspan that can reach up to 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) and a body length of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet). It has a distinctive white tail and a large, hooked beak, which it uses to catch and tear its prey. The species' plumage is predominantly brown, with a grayish-brown head and neck, and a white tail and underparts.\n\nHaliaeetus albicilla is primarily found in coastal and inland areas across Europe and Asia, from Greenland and Iceland to the Pacific coast of Russia. It is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of prey, including fish, waterfowl, small mammals, and carrion.\n\nThe white-tailed eagle is considered a conservation-dependent species, with populations that have historically been threatened by hunting, habitat loss, and environmental contamination. Conservation efforts, including legal protection and habitat management, have helped to stabilize and, in some cases, increase the species' population in recent decades.",
