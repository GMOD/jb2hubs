  "description": "Haliotis asinina, commonly known as the donkey's ear abalone, is a species of marine gastropod mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalones.\n\nThis species is found in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Philippines and northern Australia. Haliotis asinina is a herbivorous species, feeding primarily on various species of seaweed and algae.\n\nThe shell of Haliotis asinina is ear-shaped, with a series of open respiratory pores along one side. The shell can reach a maximum size of around 15 cm in length. The inner surface of the shell displays an iridescent, nacre-like lining, which is the source of the species' commercial value for use in various decorative and jewelry applications.\n\nHaliotis asinina is considered an important aquaculture species in several countries within its native range, as its meat is highly prized as a delicacy. Conservation efforts are ongoing to ensure the sustainable management of wild populations, as overharvesting has been a concern in some regions.",
