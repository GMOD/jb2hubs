It is a bottom-dwelling species, typically inhabiting rocky reefs and kelp forests.\n\nThe shell of Haliotis rubra is oval-shaped and ear-like, with a series of small holes along one side. The exterior of the shell is typically dark in color, ranging from black to dark reddish-brown, while the interior is iridescent and pearly. The foot of the animal is large and muscular, allowing it to cling tightly to the substrate.\n\nHaliotis rubra is an important commercial and recreational species, as its meat is highly valued for its culinary properties. The species is also of ecological significance, as it plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystems it inhabits, grazing on various algae and contributing to the overall productivity and diversity of the coastal communities.",
