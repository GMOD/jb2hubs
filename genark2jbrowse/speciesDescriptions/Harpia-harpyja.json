  "description": "Harpia harpyja, commonly known as the harpy eagle, is a large and powerful bird of prey found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is the largest and most powerful eagle in the Western Hemisphere, with a wingspan that can reach up to 2 meters (6.6 feet) and a body weight of up to 9 kilograms (20 pounds).\n\nThe harpy eagle is characterized by its distinctive gray and white plumage, with a large, hooked beak and powerful talons that can crush the bones of its prey. It is an apex predator, feeding primarily on medium-sized mammals such as sloths, monkeys, and small deer.\n\nHarpy eagles are known for their exceptional hunting abilities, with their keen eyesight and remarkable maneuverability allowing them to navigate the dense rainforest canopy and ambush their prey from above. They build large nests in the tops of tall trees, often reusing the same nest for multiple breeding seasons.\n\nDue to habitat loss and hunting, the harpy eagle is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts are focused on protecting the remaining populations and their rainforest habitats, ensuring the long-term survival of this impressive and iconic bird of prey.",
