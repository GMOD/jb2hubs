  "description": "Helicoverpa zea, commonly known as the corn earworm or cotton bollworm, is a significant agricultural pest species belonging to the family Noctuidae. It is a polyphagous insect, meaning it can feed on a wide range of host plants, including corn, cotton, tomatoes, and various other crops.\n\nThe adult Helicoverpa zea is a moth with a wingspan of approximately 35-40 mm. The forewings are pale yellowish-brown to reddish-brown, with a distinctive dark spot near the center. The hindwings are pale with a dark band along the outer margin.\n\nThe larvae, or caterpillars, of H. zea are the primary damaging stage of this pest. They are typically green, brown, or pink in color, with distinct longitudinal stripes along their bodies. The larvae can grow up to 40 mm in length and are known for their voracious feeding habits, which can cause significant damage to the crops they infest.\n\nHelicoverpa zea has a widespread distribution, found throughout the Americas, Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia. It is considered a major pest of economic importance, as its larvae can cause substantial yield losses in various agricultural crops, particularly corn and cotton. Effective management strategies often involve integrated pest management techniques, including the use of biological control agents, pheromone-based monitoring, and the deployment of resistant crop varieties.",
