  "description": "Heliocidaris tuberculata is a species of sea urchin belonging to the family Echinometridae. It is found in the coastal waters of eastern Australia, from southern Queensland to southern New South Wales.\n\nThe species is characterized by a globular test (shell) that can reach up to 10 cm in diameter. The test is covered in numerous, short, blunt spines that are typically reddish-brown or purplish-black in color. The spines are arranged in regular vertical rows, giving the urchin a distinctive, textured appearance.\n\nHeliocidaris tuberculata is an important component of the rocky reef and kelp forest ecosystems it inhabits, where it plays a role in the grazing and shaping of the benthic (seafloor) community. The species is known to feed on a variety of algae and other small marine organisms.\n\nLike other sea urchins, Heliocidaris tuberculata reproduces by releasing eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a pelagic (free-swimming) stage before settling to the seafloor and metamorphosing into the adult form.\n\nThe species is of ecological importance and is also harvested for human consumption in some regions, particularly as a delicacy in certain Asian cuisines.",
