  "description": "Hemaris fuciformis, commonly known as the broad-bordered bee hawk-moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sphingidae. It is a member of the genus Hemaris, which includes several species of hawk-moths that resemble bees or wasps in their appearance and behavior.\n\nThe broad-bordered bee hawk-moth is a medium-sized moth, with a wingspan of around 45-55 millimeters. Its body is covered in dense, velvety brown or olive-green hairs, giving it a bumblebee-like appearance. The wings are transparent, with a distinct dark border along the outer edge, and the hind wings are typically pale yellow or orange.\n\nThese moths are active during the day, unlike most other hawk-moths, and can often be seen hovering and feeding on the nectar of various flowers, such as honeysuckle, phlox, and rhododendrons. Their flight pattern and behavior resemble that of bees or wasps, which is thought to be a form of Batesian mimicry, helping them to avoid predation.\n\nHemaris fuciformis is found across Europe and parts of Asia, with its range extending from the United Kingdom to central Asia. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves of various plants, including honeysuckle, bedstraw, and snowberry, and can be found during the summer months.",
