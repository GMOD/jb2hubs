  "description": "Hemibagrus wyckioides is a species of freshwater catfish belonging to the family Bagridae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including the Mekong River basin in Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\n\nThe Hemibagrus wyckioides is a medium-sized catfish, typically reaching lengths of around 40-60 cm. It has a robust, elongated body with a broad, flattened head. The fish is characterized by the presence of four pairs of barbels around the mouth, which are used for tactile exploration and feeding. The coloration of the Hemibagrus wyckioides is generally dark brown or olive-green on the dorsal side, with a lighter, yellowish-white ventral region.\n\nThis species inhabits large rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, preferring areas with moderate to fast-flowing currents and rocky or sandy substrates. Hemibagrus wyckioides is an omnivorous feeder, consuming a variety of aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and plant material.\n\nThe Hemibagrus wyckioides is of commercial importance in some regions of Southeast Asia, where it is targeted by both artisanal and commercial fisheries. However, its populations have been affected by factors such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and the construction of dams, leading to conservation concerns in certain areas.",
