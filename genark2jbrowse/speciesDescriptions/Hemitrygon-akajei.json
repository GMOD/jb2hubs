  "description": "Hemitrygon akajei, commonly known as the Japanese whipray, is a species of stingray belonging to the family Dasyatidae. It is found in the western Pacific Ocean, primarily around Japan, Korea, and China.\n\nThe Japanese whipray is a medium-sized ray, typically reaching a disc width of around 60-80 cm. It has a flattened, diamond-shaped disc with rounded outer corners and a long, whip-like tail that can be as long as or longer than the disc width. The dorsal surface is generally a dark brown or grayish-brown color, while the ventral surface is pale.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit coastal and nearshore waters, often in areas with sandy or muddy substrates. It feeds primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. The Japanese whipray is ovoviviparous, meaning the embryos develop within the mother's body and are born live as fully-formed young.\n\nDue to its relatively limited distribution and potential threats from habitat degradation and fishing pressures, the Japanese whipray is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts and sustainable management practices are important for the long-term survival of this species.",
