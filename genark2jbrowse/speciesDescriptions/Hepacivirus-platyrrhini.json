  "description": "Hepacivirus platyrrhini is a species of virus within the genus Hepacivirus, which belongs to the family Flaviviridae. This virus was first isolated from the New World monkeys known as platyrrhine primates, specifically the titi monkey (Callicebus spp.).\n\nHepacivirus platyrrhini is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is closely related to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that infects humans. Like HCV, Hepacivirus platyrrhini is believed to primarily target the liver and cause hepatic disease in its natural host, the titi monkey.\n\nThe genome of Hepacivirus platyrrhini consists of approximately 9,400 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into various structural and non-structural viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Hepacivirus platyrrhini is distinct from HCV and other hepaciviruses found in humans and other mammals, suggesting it has co-evolved with its primate hosts over a long period of time.\n\nHepacivirus platyrrhini is of interest to researchers studying the evolution and host specificity of hepaciviruses, as well as the potential for cross-species transmission of these viruses between primates and humans.",
