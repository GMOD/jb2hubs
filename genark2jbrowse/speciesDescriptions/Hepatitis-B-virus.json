  "description": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small, partially double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family. It is a major global public health concern, causing acute and chronic liver infections that can lead to severe liver diseases, such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThe HBV genome is approximately 3.2 kilobases in length and encodes four overlapping open reading frames that produce several viral proteins, including the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg), the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and the viral polymerase.\n\nThe virus primarily infects and replicates within hepatocytes, the main liver cells. The viral infection can result in various clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic carrier states to acute and chronic hepatitis, which can progress to liver failure and liver cancer.\n\nHBV is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, such as blood, saliva, or semen, and can be prevented through vaccination. Antiviral therapies are available to manage chronic HBV infection and reduce the risk of liver disease progression.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of HBV is crucial for the development of effective prevention strategies and improved treatment options for individuals affected by this serious viral infection.",
