  "description": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 4 is a subtype of the Hepatitis C virus, which is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Hepacivirus within the Flaviviridae family. HCV genotype 4 is primarily found in the Middle East and Africa, particularly in Egypt, where it is the most prevalent genotype.\n\nThe genome of HCV genotype 4 consists of approximately 9,600 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural (core, E1, and E2) and non-structural (p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) proteins. The genomic sequence of HCV genotype 4 exhibits significant genetic diversity, with multiple subtypes (4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4f, 4g, 4h, 4i, 4j, 4k, 4l, 4m, 4n, 4o, 4p, 4q, and 4r) identified based on their genetic variations.\n\nHCV genotype 4 is associated with a higher prevalence of extrahepatic manifestations, such as cryoglobulinemia and lymphoma, compared to other HCV genotypes. Additionally, patients infected with HCV genotype 4 may have a lower response rate to certain direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments compared to other genotypes, highlighting the importance of accurate genotyping and individualized treatment approaches.",
