  "description": "Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a small, circular, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that requires the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) to replicate and cause infection. HDV is considered a satellite virus, as it is dependent on HBV for its life cycle and transmission.\n\nHDV is the only known human virus that contains a circular RNA genome and uses a unique replication mechanism. It encodes a single protein, the delta antigen, which is essential for viral RNA replication and packaging. The virus can cause acute or chronic hepatitis, and it is typically more severe than Hepatitis B alone, leading to an increased risk of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.\n\nHDV infection is uncommon globally, but it is considered endemic in certain regions, such as the Mediterranean, Middle East, and parts of Central and South America. The virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with infected blood or body fluids, and co-infection with HBV is required for its propagation.\n\nUnderstanding the unique features and dependencies of HDV is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies, as well as for controlling the spread of this serious liver disease.",
