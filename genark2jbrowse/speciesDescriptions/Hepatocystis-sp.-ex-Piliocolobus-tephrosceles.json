  "description": "Hepatocystis sp. ex Piliocolobus tephrosceles is a species of protozoan parasite that infects the Ugandan red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus tephrosceles), a primate species found in Uganda, Africa.\n\nHepatocystis is a genus of blood parasites that belong to the Apicomplexa phylum, a group of single-celled eukaryotic organisms known for their complex life cycles and specialized organelles. These parasites primarily reside and reproduce within the liver cells (hepatocytes) of their host, hence the name \"Hepatocystis.\"\n\nThe life cycle of Hepatocystis sp. ex Piliocolobus tephrosceles typically involves transmission by blood-feeding insects, such as mosquitoes, which act as the vector. When an infected insect takes a blood meal from the Ugandan red colobus monkey, the parasites are introduced into the host's bloodstream. The parasites then migrate to the liver, where they undergo asexual reproduction within the hepatocytes, forming cyst-like structures called meronts.\n\nThe presence of Hepatocystis parasites in the Ugandan red colobus monkey can have various impacts on the host's health, ranging from mild to severe. In some cases, the infection may be asymptomatic, while in others, it can lead to anemia, fever, and other clinical manifestations. The specific effects of this Hepatocystis species on the Ugandan red colobus monkey are an area of ongoing research.",
