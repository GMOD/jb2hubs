  "description": "Heyndrickxia coagulans DSM 1 = ATCC 7050 is a bacterium species that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Bacilli, and order Bacillales. It is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nHeyndrickxia coagulans is known for its ability to coagulate milk, hence the specific epithet \"coagulans.\" It is a thermophilic bacterium, meaning it thrives in high-temperature environments, with an optimal growth temperature around 55°C (131°F).\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil and has been studied for its potential applications in the food and biotechnology industries, particularly in the production of enzymes and the fermentation of dairy products.\n\nThe designation \"DSM 1\" indicates that this strain is deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures), and the \"ATCC 7050\" refers to its deposition in the American Type Culture Collection, which is a widely recognized collection of microbial cultures.",
