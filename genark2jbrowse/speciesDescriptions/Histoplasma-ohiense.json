  "description": "Histoplasma ohiense is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Histoplasma. It is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it can exist in two different forms: a mycelial form and a yeast form.\n\nThe mycelial form of Histoplasma ohiense is found in the environment, typically in soil or bat guano. In this form, the fungus produces small, round spores called conidia that can be dispersed through the air and inhaled by humans or other hosts.\n\nWhen the conidia are inhaled, they can reach the alveoli (tiny air sacs) in the lungs, where they transform into the yeast form. In the yeast form, the fungus is able to replicate and infect the host's cells, leading to a respiratory infection known as histoplasmosis.\n\nHistoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma ohiense can range from asymptomatic to severe, depending on the individual's immune response and the extent of the infection. Symptoms may include fever, cough, chest pain, and fatigue. In immunocompromised individuals, the infection can disseminate to other organs, causing more serious complications.\n\nHistoplasma ohiense is primarily found in the midwestern United States, particularly in the state of Ohio, where it was first isolated and described. Identification of the species is typically done through genetic analysis, as the morphological characteristics can be similar to other Histoplasma species.",
