  "description": "Hom-1 vesivirus is a member of the Vesivirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\n\nThe Hom-1 vesivirus particle is approximately 27-38 nanometers in diameter and has an icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is approximately 8.2-8.5 kilobases in length and encodes several essential proteins, including the viral capsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which are crucial for the virus's replication and assembly.\n\nHom-1 vesivirus was initially isolated from a domestic cat and is believed to primarily infect members of the Felidae family, such as cats and lions. The virus can cause various clinical manifestations, including vesicular lesions, respiratory symptoms, and gastrointestinal disorders, in its natural hosts.\n\nThe Hom-1 vesivirus is classified as a member of the Vesivirus genus due to its morphological and genomic characteristics, which are similar to other viruses within this genus. It is considered a significant pathogen in veterinary medicine and may have implications for animal health and welfare.",
