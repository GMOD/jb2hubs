  "description": "Homarus americanus, commonly known as the American lobster or Atlantic lobster, is a species of clawed lobster found in the western North Atlantic Ocean. It is the largest extant species of all the lobsters, with a maximum recorded body length of over 60 cm (24 inches) and a weight of over 20 kg (44 pounds).\n\nThe American lobster has a hard, calcified exoskeleton that ranges in color from greenish-brown to reddish-brown, with occasional blue or black individuals. It has a characteristic pair of large, asymmetrical claws, with the larger claw being used for crushing and the smaller one for tearing. The species is known for its impressive size, long lifespan (up to 100 years), and excellent swimming ability.\n\nHomarus americanus plays a significant ecological role in its environment, serving as both a predator and prey. It is a crucial component of the marine food web, feeding on a variety of organisms, including mollusks, crustaceans, and fish. The American lobster is also an important commercial species, supporting a lucrative fishing industry in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.",
