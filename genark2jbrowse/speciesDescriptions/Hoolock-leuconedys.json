  "description": "Hoolock leuconedys, commonly known as the eastern hoolock gibbon, is a species of gibbon found in northeastern India, eastern Bangladesh, and southwestern China. It is a small, arboreal primate that belongs to the family Hylobatidae.\n\nThe eastern hoolock gibbon is characterized by its distinctive black and white coloration. Adults have a black body and face, with a prominent white brow band and white arms and legs. Juveniles are entirely black and gradually develop the distinctive white markings as they mature.\n\nThese gibbons are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and flowers. They are known for their remarkable acrobatic abilities, using their long arms to swing through the forest canopy with great agility.\n\nHoolock leuconedys is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and ecotourism initiatives, are crucial for the survival of this unique primate species.",
