  "description": "Hormaphis cornu is a species of aphid, a small sap-sucking insect that belongs to the family Hormaphididae. This aphid species is known to have a complex life cycle, involving a host alternation between primary and secondary host plants.\n\nThe primary host plant for Hormaphis cornu is the witch hazel (Hamamelis spp.), where the aphids undergo sexual reproduction and produce overwintering eggs. In the spring, the eggs hatch, and the aphids colonize the witch hazel, feeding on the plant's sap and undergoing several generations.\n\nLater in the season, the aphids produce winged forms that migrate to the secondary host plant, which is the birch tree (Betula spp.). On the birch tree, the aphids continue to feed and reproduce asexually, forming colonies of apterous (wingless) individuals.\n\nHormaphis cornu is a gall-forming aphid, meaning that the feeding of the aphids on the witch hazel plant induces the formation of distinctive, horn-shaped galls on the leaves and twigs. These galls provide shelter and protection for the developing aphid colonies.\n\nThe life cycle of Hormaphis cornu is an example of the complex adaptations and host alternation strategies commonly observed in aphid species, which allow them to exploit different resources and environmental conditions throughout the year.",
