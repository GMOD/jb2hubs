  "description": "Human T-cell Leukemia Virus Type I (HTLV-I) is a retrovirus that primarily infects and transforms human T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. It is the causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), a rare and aggressive form of cancer, as well as HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a chronic neurological disorder.\n\nHTLV-I is transmitted primarily through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as during sexual contact, from mother to child during breastfeeding, or through contaminated blood transfusions. The virus integrates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, leading to the immortalization and transformation of infected T cells.\n\nHTLV-I infection can remain asymptomatic for years or even decades before the development of ATLL or HAM/TSP in a small percentage of infected individuals. The mechanisms by which HTLV-I induces cellular transformation and the development of these diseases are complex and involve the viral oncoprotein Tax, which dysregulates various cellular pathways.\n\nUnderstanding the biology of HTLV-I and its associated diseases has been crucial for the development of diagnostic tests, treatment strategies, and public health measures to control the spread of this virus.",
