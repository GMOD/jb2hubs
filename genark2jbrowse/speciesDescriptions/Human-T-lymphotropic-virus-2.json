  "description": "Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 (HTLV-2) is a member of the Retroviridae family, specifically the Deltaretrovirus genus. It is a human retrovirus that primarily infects and replicates in T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.\n\nHTLV-2 is closely related to the more well-known human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), but it is less pathogenic and less associated with severe diseases compared to HTLV-1. The virus is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, during sexual contact or from mother to child during breastfeeding.\n\nInfection with HTLV-2 is often asymptomatic, and the majority of infected individuals do not develop any associated diseases. However, in a small percentage of cases, HTLV-2 infection has been linked to the development of neurological disorders, such as tropical spastic paraparesis, and a rare form of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.\n\nThe genome of HTLV-2 contains several genes, including the structural genes (gag, pol, and env) and regulatory genes (tax and rex), which play crucial roles in the viral life cycle and the modulation of host cell gene expression.\n\nDiagnosis of HTLV-2 infection typically involves serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot, to detect the presence of HTLV-2-specific antibodies in the patient's blood. Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can also be used to detect the viral genetic material.\n\nOverall, HTLV-2 is a retrovirus that primarily affects T-lymphocytes and has a lower pathogenic potential compared to its closely related counterpart, HTLV-1.",
