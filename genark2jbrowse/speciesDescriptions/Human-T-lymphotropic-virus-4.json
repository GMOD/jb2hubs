  "description": "Human T-lymphotropic virus 4 (HTLV-4) is a retrovirus that belongs to the genus Deltaretrovirus, which also includes the well-known Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) and Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 (HTLV-2). HTLV-4 is a newly discovered virus, and its existence was first reported in 2005 after it was isolated from a person living in Cameroon, Central Africa.\n\nThe HTLV-4 virus primarily infects and replicates within human T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. Like other deltaretroviruses, HTLV-4 is believed to be transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or sexual secretions, from an infected individual to a healthy person.\n\nThe clinical significance and disease associations of HTLV-4 infection are not yet fully understood, as only a few cases have been reported to date. However, based on the similarities with other HTLV viruses, it is possible that HTLV-4 infection may be linked to the development of certain types of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma or neurological disorders, such as tropical spastic paraparesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of HTLV-4 infection in humans.",
