  "description": "Human adenovirus 1 (HAdV-1) is a member of the Mastadenovirus genus within the Adenoviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid structure.\n\nHAdV-1 is known to primarily infect the human respiratory tract and can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including acute respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. The virus enters the host cells by binding to the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) on the cell surface, triggering internalization and subsequent replication within the host's cells.\n\nStructurally, HAdV-1 has a genome size of approximately 36 kilobase pairs, encoding for multiple proteins involved in viral entry, replication, and assembly. The viral capsid is composed of three major proteins: hexon, penton base, and fiber, which play crucial roles in host cell recognition and attachment.\n\nHAdV-1 is considered a common human pathogen and is known to cause self-limiting infections in immunocompetent individuals. However, in immunocompromised patients, such as those with underlying medical conditions or undergoing certain medical treatments, HAdV-1 infections can lead to more severe and potentially life-threatening complications.",
