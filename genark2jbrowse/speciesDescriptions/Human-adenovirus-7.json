  "description": "Human adenovirus 7 (HAdV-7) is a member of the Adenoviridae family, which are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HAdV-7 is a species of the Mastadenovirus genus and is known to primarily infect humans.\n\nHAdV-7 is classified as a respiratory adenovirus, meaning it typically causes respiratory tract infections in humans. The virus enters the host cells, primarily those in the upper and lower respiratory tract, through interactions between the viral fiber and cellular receptors. Once inside the host cell, the viral DNA is transported to the nucleus, where it hijacks the cellular machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles.\n\nHAdV-7 infections can result in a range of clinical manifestations, including acute respiratory illness, pneumonia, and even severe and life-threatening complications, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions. The virus can also be associated with other clinical presentations, such as conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and neurological disorders, though these are less common.\n\nEpidemiologically, HAdV-7 is considered a relatively rare adenovirus serotype, but it has been known to cause sporadic outbreaks and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to other adenovirus serotypes. Effective prevention and control measures, as well as ongoing surveillance and research, are essential for understanding and managing HAdV-7 infections.",
