  "description": "Human betaherpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) is a member of the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. It is a DNA virus that primarily infects human cells and is commonly found in the general population.\n\nHHV-7 is classified as a Roseolovirus, a genus within the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily. It is closely related to another human betaherpesvirus, Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and shares some genomic similarities with it.\n\nThe virus is known to establish lifelong latent infections in its human hosts, with the ability to reactivate and cause symptomatic disease under certain conditions, such as immunosuppression. However, in most cases, HHV-7 infection is asymptomatic or associated with mild, non-specific symptoms.\n\nHHV-7 primarily targets and replicates in CD4+ T lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. The virus can also infect other cell types, including monocytes, macrophages, and neural cells.\n\nSeroepidemiological studies have shown that HHV-7 infection is common, with a worldwide prevalence ranging from 70% to 100% in adults, depending on the geographic region.\n\nWhile the clinical significance of HHV-7 infection is still being investigated, it has been associated with various clinical manifestations, including febrile illnesses, rashes, and potential neurological complications in immunocompromised individuals.",
