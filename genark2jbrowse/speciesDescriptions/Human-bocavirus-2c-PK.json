  "description": "Human bocavirus 2c PK is a member of the Bocaparvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that infects humans.\n\nThe genome of Human bocavirus 2c PK consists of approximately 5.5 kilobases and encodes three major structural proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) and two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NP1). The virus primarily targets the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, causing a range of clinical symptoms, including upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Human bocavirus 2c PK is a distinct genetic variant within the Human bocavirus 2 species, which is further divided into several genotypes (2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d). The PK strain was initially identified in Pakistan, indicating its geographical distribution.\n\nResearch on the epidemiology, clinical significance, and molecular characteristics of Human bocavirus 2c PK is ongoing to better understand its role in human health and disease.",
