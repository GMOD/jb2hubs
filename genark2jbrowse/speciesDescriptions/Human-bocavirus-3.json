  "description": "Human bocavirus 3 (HBoV3) is a recently discovered member of the Parvoviridae family, specifically belonging to the genus Bocaparvovirus. It is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that was first identified in 2010 from respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory tract infections.\n\nHBoV3 is closely related to other human bocaviruses, such as HBoV1 and HBoV2, but it has distinct genetic and phylogenetic characteristics that distinguish it as a separate species. The viral genome of HBoV3 is approximately 5.5 kilobases in length and encodes for several essential proteins, including the non-structural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and the structural capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2).\n\nThe exact prevalence and clinical significance of HBoV3 infections are still under investigation. Studies have reported the detection of HBoV3 in both respiratory and gastrointestinal samples, suggesting that it may have a broader tropism and potentially contribute to various disease manifestations. However, the role of HBoV3 in human health and disease is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications.",
