  "description": "Human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) is a species of small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Bocaparvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It was first identified in 2010 and is considered a newly emerging human pathogen.\n\nHBoV4 is a single-stranded DNA virus with a genome of approximately 5.5 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the non-structural proteins (NS1 and NP1) and the structural capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2).\n\nEpidemiological studies have indicated that HBoV4 is globally distributed, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 1% to 10% in various human populations. The virus is primarily associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, but its exact clinical significance and pathogenic mechanisms are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the prevalence, transmission dynamics, and potential clinical implications of HBoV4 infections in humans. Ongoing surveillance and molecular epidemiological studies can provide valuable insights into the epidemiology and evolution of this emerging human parvovirus.",
