  "description": "Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a member of the Coronaviridae family, specifically the genus Alphacoronavirus. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that primarily infects human hosts.\n\nHCoV-229E is one of the four human coronaviruses known to cause common cold-like symptoms, along with HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. It is typically associated with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold, in immunocompetent individuals.\n\nThe virus primarily targets the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, where it can replicate and spread to other individuals through respiratory droplets or direct contact. Infection with HCoV-229E can lead to symptoms like nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, and sneezing, typically lasting for a few days to a week.\n\nHCoV-229E is considered a relatively common and widespread human coronavirus, with seroprevalence studies indicating that most people have been exposed to the virus at some point during their lifetime. However, it is generally less prevalent and causes less severe illness compared to other human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19.",
