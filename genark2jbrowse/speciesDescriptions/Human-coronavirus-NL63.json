  "description": "Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) is a species of RNA virus that belongs to the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. It was first identified in 2004 from a Dutch child with a respiratory tract infection.\n\nHCoV-NL63 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans. The virus uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, the same as the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to gain entry into host cells.\n\nInfection with HCoV-NL63 typically causes mild to moderate respiratory illness, such as the common cold, croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, especially in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The virus is thought to be globally distributed and can cause seasonal outbreaks, with higher prevalence during the winter and spring months.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has revealed that HCoV-NL63 is closely related to bat coronaviruses, suggesting a potential zoonotic origin. Further research is ongoing to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features associated with HCoV-NL63 infections.",
