  "description": "Human cosavirus B (HCoSV-B) is a recently discovered virus that belongs to the genus Cosavirus, within the family Picornaviridae. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\n\nHCoSV-B was first identified in human stool samples and has been detected in various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa, and Europe. The virus is primarily associated with the gastrointestinal tract and has been detected in individuals with and without diarrheal symptoms.\n\nThe genome of HCoSV-B consists of approximately 7,500 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural and non-structural viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that HCoSV-B is genetically distinct from other known cosavirus species, indicating that it represents a unique strain or genotype within the genus.\n\nThe pathogenic potential and clinical significance of HCoSV-B infection are still under investigation. While some studies have linked the virus to gastrointestinal symptoms, its role in causing human disease is not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential impact of this newly discovered human virus.",
