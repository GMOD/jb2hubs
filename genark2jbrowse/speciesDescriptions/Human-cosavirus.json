  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called \"Human cosavirus.\" Cosavirus is a genus of viruses that belong to the family Picornaviridae, but there is no specific virus known as the \"Human cosavirus.\"\n\nPicornaviruses are a group of small, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect a variety of hosts, including humans, animals, and plants. The cosavirus genus was first identified in 2010 and includes viruses that have been detected in human stool samples, primarily in children. However, the clinical significance and potential disease associations of these viruses in humans are still under investigation.\n\nWithout more specific information about a hypothetical \"Human cosavirus,\" I cannot provide a more detailed scientific description. The cosavirus genus in general is an area of ongoing research, and the understanding of these viruses and their interactions with human health is still evolving.",
