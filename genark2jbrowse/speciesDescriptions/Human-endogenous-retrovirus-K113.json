  "description": "Human endogenous retrovirus K113 (HERV-K113) is a type of endogenous retrovirus found in the human genome. Endogenous retroviruses are viral sequences that have been integrated into the host's DNA and are passed down through generations.\n\nHERV-K113 is one of the most recently integrated endogenous retroviruses in the human genome, with an estimated integration time of approximately 200,000 years ago. It is classified as a member of the HERV-K family, which is the most active and well-studied group of human endogenous retroviruses.\n\nThe HERV-K113 provirus contains the typical retroviral genes, including gag, pol, and env, which encode the structural and enzymatic proteins necessary for viral replication. However, HERV-K113 is considered to be a replication-competent but potentially defective endogenous retrovirus, as it may lack the ability to produce infectious viral particles due to the accumulation of mutations over time.\n\nDespite its potential defective nature, HERV-K113 has been the subject of ongoing research due to its potential involvement in various human diseases, including certain types of cancer and autoimmune disorders. The expression and potential biological functions of HERV-K113 in the human body are still actively being investigated by the scientific community.",
