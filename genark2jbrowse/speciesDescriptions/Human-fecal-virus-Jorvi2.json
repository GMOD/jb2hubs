In general, fecal viruses may include enteric viruses that are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, but more specifics would require consultation with experts in virology and microbiology. I apologize that I cannot provide a more detailed scientific account for this particular virus. My knowledge is limited without access to authoritative sources.",
