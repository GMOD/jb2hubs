  "description": "Human hepegivirus, also known as human hepelike virus (HHpgV), is a recently discovered member of the Hepeviridae family. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is closely related to the hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is the causative agent of hepatitis E in humans.\n\nThe genome of the human hepegivirus is approximately 9.6 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of the viral structural and non-structural proteins. The virus is believed to be transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, similar to HEV, although the exact modes of transmission are still under investigation.\n\nThe clinical significance of human hepegivirus infection is not yet fully understood, as the virus has only been recently discovered. Some studies have suggested that it may be associated with liver disease, but the exact nature of its pathogenicity and its potential impact on human health are still being explored by the scientific community.\n\nFurther research is needed to better characterize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of human hepegivirus infection. Understanding the biology and behavior of this newly discovered virus is crucial for developing effective diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic interventions.",
