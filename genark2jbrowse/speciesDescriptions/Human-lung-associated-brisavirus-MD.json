  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called \"Human lung-associated brisavirus MD\" in the scientific literature. Brisaviruses are a genus of viruses that primarily infect insects, and there are no confirmed reports of a brisavirus found in human lungs. Without more information about the source or context of this specific name, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Requests for information about fictional or unverified species cannot be accurately answered. If you have additional details about this supposed virus, I would be happy to try and research it further.",
