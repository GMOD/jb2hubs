  "description": "Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to provide a comprehensive scientific description of the \"Human lung-associated vientovirus FB\" species. This appears to be a very specific and likely newly discovered virus that is not widely documented in the scientific literature. Without access to detailed information about the virology, epidemiology, and genomic characteristics of this particular virus, I cannot confidently summarize its scientific properties. More research and documentation would be needed to generate an accurate short scientific description of this virus. My knowledge is limited to more commonly studied and reported viral species. I apologize that I cannot provide the requested information for this particular virus.",
