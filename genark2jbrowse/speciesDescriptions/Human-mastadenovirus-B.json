  "description": "Human mastadenovirus B is a species of adenovirus that infects humans. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that belong to the family Adenoviridae. The Human mastadenovirus B species is one of the seven species of adenoviruses that can infect humans (Human mastadenovirus A to G).\n\nHuman mastadenovirus B is characterized by a linear, double-stranded DNA genome that is approximately 35 kilobases in size. The viral capsid is icosahedral in shape and is composed of three main structural proteins: hexon, penton base, and fiber. These proteins play crucial roles in viral attachment, entry, and immune evasion.\n\nInfection with Human mastadenovirus B can lead to a variety of clinical manifestations, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The virus is known to be transmitted through respiratory droplets, direct contact, or contaminated surfaces. Certain strains within the Human mastadenovirus B species are associated with more severe disease outcomes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of Human mastadenovirus B is important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies, as well as for monitoring the emergence of new adenovirus variants that may pose public health concerns.",
