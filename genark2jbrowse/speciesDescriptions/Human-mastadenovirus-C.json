  "description": "Human mastadenovirus C is a type of adenovirus that primarily infects humans. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that belong to the Adenoviridae family. The \"C\" designation refers to the species classification within the Mastadenovirus genus.\n\nHuman mastadenovirus C is a common pathogen that can cause a variety of respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, pneumonia, and bronchitis. It is transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, although it can also infect the eyes, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs in some cases.\n\nThe virus enters host cells by binding to specific cellular receptors and hijacking the cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material and assemble new viral particles. The immune system typically mounts a response to clear the infection, but the virus can also evade or suppress certain immune mechanisms, leading to persistent or recurrent infections in some individuals.\n\nDiagnosis of human mastadenovirus C infection often involves molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, to detect the presence of the viral genetic material. Treatment typically involves supportive care, with antiviral medications or other interventions reserved for severe or complicated cases.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of human mastadenovirus C is important for developing effective prevention and control strategies, as well as advancing our knowledge of viral infections and their impact on human health.",
