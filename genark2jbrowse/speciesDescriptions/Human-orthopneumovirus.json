  "description": "Human orthopneumovirus, also known as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), is a highly contagious RNA virus that belongs to the Orthopneumovirus genus within the Pneumoviridae family. It is the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections, particularly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in infants and young children worldwide.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. Upon infection, the virus primarily targets the epithelial cells lining the upper and lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation, mucus production, and airway obstruction. This can lead to symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.\n\nHRSV is classified into two major antigenic subgroups, A and B, based on differences in the attachment (G) protein. These subgroups can co-circulate and cause seasonal outbreaks, typically during the winter and early spring months in temperate climates.\n\nWhile most HRSV infections are mild and self-limiting, the virus can be particularly severe in high-risk groups, such as premature infants, young children with underlying medical conditions, and the elderly. In these populations, HRSV can lead to serious complications, including respiratory failure, and may require hospitalization.\n\nDespite the significant burden of HRSV infections, effective vaccines and specific antiviral treatments are still under development, highlighting the ongoing need for continued research and public health efforts to better understand and control this important respiratory pathogen.",
