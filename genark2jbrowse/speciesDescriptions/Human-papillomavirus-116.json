  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 116 is a strain of the HPV virus, which is a group of DNA viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes. HPV-116 is classified as a low-risk type, meaning it is less likely to cause cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV strains.\n\nHPV-116 primarily infects the genital area, including the cervix, vulva, and penis. It can cause the development of benign warts or papillomas, which are small, raised growths on the skin or mucous membranes. These warts are typically painless and can vary in appearance, ranging from flat, smooth lesions to cauliflower-like growths.\n\nInfection with HPV-116 is typically transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual activity. The virus can persist in the body for years, and individuals infected with HPV-116 may be asymptomatic or have visible warts. While the risk of progression to cancer is lower compared to high-risk HPV strains, regular screening and monitoring are recommended to detect and manage any potential precancerous changes.",
