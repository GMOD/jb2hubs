  "description": "Human papillomavirus 121 (HPV-121) is a species of human papillomavirus that belongs to the gamma-papillomavirus genus. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects the skin and mucous membranes of the human body.\n\nHPV-121 is considered a low-risk type of HPV, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. Infection with HPV-121 is typically associated with the formation of benign warts or papillomas on the skin, such as common warts or plantar warts.\n\nThe genome of HPV-121 is approximately 7.9 kilobase pairs in length and encodes several essential viral proteins, including the early proteins (E1, E2, E6, and E7) and the late structural proteins (L1 and L2). These proteins play crucial roles in viral replication, gene expression, and the assembly of new viral particles.\n\nHPV-121 is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact, although it is less commonly associated with genital infections compared to other HPV types.\n\nInfection with HPV-121 is generally considered a minor medical concern, as the associated warts are typically harmless and can often be treated through various methods, such as cryotherapy, topical treatments, or surgical removal. However, ongoing research continues to expand our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of this and other HPV species.",
