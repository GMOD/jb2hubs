  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 134 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species, including humans. HPV 134 is considered a relatively rare type of HPV, with limited epidemiological data available.\n\nHPV 134 belongs to the Alpha-papillomavirus genus, which includes several HPV types that are associated with cutaneous and mucosal infections in humans. The virus primarily targets the stratified squamous epithelial cells, leading to the development of various types of warts or papillomas, depending on the specific site of infection.\n\nThe genome of HPV 134 is approximately 8,000 base pairs in length and encodes several early (E) and late (L) genes that are responsible for the viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation. Like other HPV types, HPV 134 is known to utilize the host cell's machinery to replicate and propagate, leading to the production of new viral particles.\n\nEpidemiological studies suggest that HPV 134 is less common compared to other HPV types that are more frequently associated with various human diseases, such as cervical cancer, anogenital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance and prevalence of HPV 134 infections in different populations.",
