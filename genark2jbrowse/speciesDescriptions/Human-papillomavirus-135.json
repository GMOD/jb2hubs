  "description": "Human papillomavirus 135 (HPV135) is a strain of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family, which is a group of DNA viruses that can infect the skin and mucous membranes of humans. HPV135 is classified as a low-risk HPV type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types.\n\nHPV135 is primarily associated with the development of benign warts or papillomas, which are small, non-cancerous growths that can appear on the skin or in the genital area. The virus can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual contact with an infected individual.\n\nLike other HPV types, HPV135 infects the basal layer of the epithelium, the outermost layer of the skin or mucous membranes. The viral DNA then integrates into the host cell's genome, leading to the production of viral proteins that can disrupt normal cell growth and division, potentially leading to the formation of warts or other lesions.\n\nWhile HPV135 is considered a low-risk HPV type, it is still important to monitor and manage any infections, as the virus can potentially cause discomfort or cosmetic concerns. Effective prevention and treatment strategies, such as vaccination and regular screening, are essential for managing the spread and impact of HPV135 and other HPV strains.",
