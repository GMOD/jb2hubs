  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 136 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species, including humans. HPV-136 is a relatively rare genotype, and its specific clinical significance and disease associations are not yet fully characterized.\n\nHPV-136 is a double-stranded circular DNA virus, with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other HPV types, it has a distinct capsid structure and encodes several key viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which can disrupt normal cellular function and contribute to the development of certain types of cancers, particularly cervical cancer.\n\nThe transmission of HPV-136 is primarily through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual contact, as the virus can reside in the mucosal and cutaneous epithelial cells of the infected host. The infection with HPV-136 may lead to the development of various types of warts or papillomas, but the exact clinical manifestations and potential for malignant transformation are not yet well-established due to the rarity of this genotype.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical implications of HPV-136 infection, as well as to develop effective diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies for this specific HPV type.",
