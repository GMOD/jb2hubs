  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 140 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various hosts, including humans. HPV-140 is a type of HPV that has been classified within the alpha-papillomavirus genus, which includes viruses primarily associated with cutaneous and mucosal infections in humans.\n\nHPV-140 is a double-stranded circular DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other HPV types, the viral genome encodes several early (E) and late (L) genes responsible for viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation. HPV-140 is considered a low-risk HPV type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission for HPV-140 is through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus primarily infects the basal layer of the epidermis and can establish a persistent infection, leading to the development of cutaneous warts or other benign skin lesions in infected individuals.\n\nWhile HPV-140 infections are generally less concerning than those caused by high-risk HPV types, they can still have clinical significance, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying skin conditions. Diagnostic techniques, such as molecular-based assays, can be used to detect the presence of HPV-140 in clinical samples, and appropriate treatment strategies may be employed to manage the associated skin lesions.",
