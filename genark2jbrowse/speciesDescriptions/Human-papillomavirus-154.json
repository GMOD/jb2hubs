  "description": "Human papillomavirus 154 (HPV-154) is a species of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. HPVs are small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that primarily infect the skin and mucosal surfaces of the human body.\n\nHPV-154 is classified within the genus Betapapillomavirus, which is one of the five genera of HPVs that primarily infect humans. Betapapapillomaviruses are typically associated with non-melanoma skin cancers and benign skin lesions, such as warts.\n\nThe genome of HPV-154 is approximately 7.9 kilobases in size and encodes for the typical HPV genes, including the early genes (E1, E2, E6, and E7) and the late genes (L1 and L2) that are involved in viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation.\n\nHPV-154 is considered a rare HPV type, and its prevalence and clinical significance are not as well-studied as some of the more common HPV types. However, research suggests that it may be associated with certain skin lesions and conditions, though further investigation is needed to fully understand its epidemiology and pathogenic potential.",
