  "description": "Human papillomavirus 172 (HPV-172) is a species of the Papillomavirus genus, which belongs to the Papillomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that primarily infects the epithelial cells of the human skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV-172 is classified as a member of the Alpha-Papillomavirus species, which includes several other HPV types that are associated with various types of warts and papillomas. The viral genome of HPV-172 is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes several essential proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and the formation of the viral capsid.\n\nLike other HPV types, HPV-172 is transmitted through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes, and it can cause the development of benign warts or lesions on the affected areas. However, the specific clinical manifestations and disease associations of HPV-172 infection are not yet well-characterized, and further research is needed to understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential implications for human health.",
