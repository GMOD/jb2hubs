  "description": "Human papillomavirus 175 (HPV-175) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various species, including humans. HPV-175 is a type of human papillomavirus, a diverse group of viruses that are known to cause a range of diseases, from benign warts to various types of cancer.\n\nHPV-175 is a double-stranded circular DNA virus, with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other papillomaviruses, HPV-175 has a unique genome organization, consisting of early (E) and late (L) genes, which encode for proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation.\n\nThe precise biological and clinical characteristics of HPV-175 are not yet fully understood, as it is a relatively recently discovered virus. However, it is believed to be associated with certain types of skin lesions or warts, although its exact role in human disease development is still under investigation.\n\nOngoing research into the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of HPV-175 continues to expand our understanding of this member of the diverse human papillomavirus family and its potential impact on human health.",
