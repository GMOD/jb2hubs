  "description": "Human papillomavirus 204 (HPV204) is a type of human papillomavirus, a group of DNA viruses that can infect the skin and mucous membranes of humans. HPV204 is a member of the Alphapapillomavirus genus, which includes several strains of HPV that are associated with various types of warts and lesions.\n\nHPV204 is primarily found in cutaneous warts, which are non-cancerous growths that can appear on the skin. The virus can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. Once the virus infects the host, it can replicate within the keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the outermost layer of the skin.\n\nThe genome of HPV204 is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes several essential viral proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and immune evasion. Like other HPV types, HPV204 has a tropism for specific epithelial cell types and can induce cellular changes that may lead to the development of warts or other skin lesions.\n\nWhile HPV204 is not considered a high-risk type for the development of cancer, it is important to understand its characteristics and epidemiology to better understand the broader spectrum of HPV-related diseases and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
