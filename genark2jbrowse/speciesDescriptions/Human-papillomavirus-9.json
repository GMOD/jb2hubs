  "description": "Human papillomavirus 9 (HPV9) is a species of the Papillomavirus genus, which belongs to the Papillomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects the epithelial cells of the human skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV9 is classified as a member of the gamma-papillomavirus genus, which includes several HPV types that are typically associated with benign skin warts or lesions. Unlike the high-risk HPV types that can lead to the development of cervical, anal, and other types of cancer, HPV9 is generally considered a low-risk HPV type.\n\nThe genome of HPV9 is approximately 7,800 base pairs in length and encodes several essential viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which can contribute to cellular transformation and the development of benign lesions. However, the risk of HPV9 progression to malignancy is significantly lower compared to the high-risk HPV types.\n\nInfection with HPV9 is relatively common, and it is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. The clinical manifestations of HPV9 infection can range from asymptomatic carrier states to the development of various types of cutaneous warts or lesions, such as common warts, plantar warts, or flat warts.\n\nWhile HPV9 is not a major public health concern compared to the high-risk HPV types, it is an important component of the diverse HPV ecosystem that affects human health and requires ongoing research and monitoring.",
