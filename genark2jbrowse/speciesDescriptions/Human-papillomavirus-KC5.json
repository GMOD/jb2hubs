  "description": "Human papillomavirus KC5 (HPV KC5) is a specific strain of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. HPV is a group of viruses that can infect the skin and mucous membranes of the human body, leading to the development of warts and other lesions.\n\nHPV KC5 is classified as a member of the Kappa-5 papillomavirus species within the Papillomaviridae family. This particular strain is known to primarily infect the skin, causing the formation of common warts, also known as verrucae vulgaris.\n\nThe HPV KC5 virus contains a circular, double-stranded DNA genome that encodes several proteins essential for its replication and the development of warts. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected skin or by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nWhile HPV KC5 infections are generally not considered to be as high-risk as some other HPV strains that are associated with the development of cervical and other cancers, it can still cause significant skin-related health issues, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems.",
