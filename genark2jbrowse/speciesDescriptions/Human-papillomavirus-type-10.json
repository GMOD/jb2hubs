  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 10 (HPV-10) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. HPV-10 belongs to the Alpha-Papillomavirus genus and is primarily associated with common warts (verrucae vulgaris) and flat warts (verruca plana) in humans.\n\nThe HPV-10 genome is approximately 7.9 kilobase pairs in length and encodes for several essential viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which can interfere with the normal cellular processes and contribute to the development of certain types of warts. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes, and it can establish a persistent infection in the host's cells.\n\nHPV-10 is generally considered a low-risk type of human papillomavirus, as it is not strongly associated with the development of malignant lesions, unlike some other HPV types that are linked to the progression of cervical, anal, and other types of cancer. However, the infection with HPV-10 can still lead to the formation of benign warts, which can be a cosmetic concern and may require treatment in some cases.",
