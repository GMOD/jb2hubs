  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 112 (HPV-112) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various organisms, including humans. HPV-112 is a specific type within the Alphapapillomavirus genus, which primarily infects the mucosal and cutaneous epithelia of the human body.\n\nHPV-112 is known to be associated with the development of various types of warts and papillomas, which are benign growths on the skin or mucous membranes. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected skin or mucous membranes, and it can also be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth.\n\nThe genome of HPV-112 consists of approximately 8,000 base pairs and encodes for several essential viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are known to play a role in the transformation of normal cells into cancerous cells. However, the specific role of HPV-112 in the development of cancer is not well-understood, and further research is needed to determine its clinical significance.",
