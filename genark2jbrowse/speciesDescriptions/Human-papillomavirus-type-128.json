  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 128 (HPV-128) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various hosts, including humans. HPV-128 is a relatively recently discovered HPV type, with its genome first being characterized in 2018.\n\nHPV-128 is classified as a member of the Gammapapillomavirus genus, which includes HPV types that are typically found in healthy individuals and are not strongly associated with the development of cancers or other significant clinical conditions. The HPV-128 genome consists of a double-stranded circular DNA molecule, approximately 7,900 base pairs in length, which encodes the viral proteins necessary for its replication and persistence within the host cells.\n\nLike other HPV types, HPV-128 is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, and it can establish a persistent infection within the epithelial cells of the host. However, the specific tropism, pathogenicity, and potential clinical significance of HPV-128 are not yet fully understood, as it is a relatively new and understudied HPV type.\n\nFurther research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical relevance, and potential public health implications of HPV-128 infection, as well as its interactions with the host immune system and other co-infecting pathogens.",
