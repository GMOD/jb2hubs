  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 129 (HPV-129) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the skin and mucosal surfaces of various vertebrate hosts, including humans. HPV-129 is classified as a high-risk type of HPV, meaning it is associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly cervical cancer.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV-129 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The genome encodes several viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are known to disrupt normal cellular processes and contribute to the development of cancer. HPV-129 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and can cause a variety of benign and malignant lesions, such as genital warts and precancerous cervical changes.\n\nInfection with HPV-129 can be detected using molecular diagnostic techniques, such as DNA-based tests, which can identify the presence of the viral DNA in clinical samples. Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical implications of HPV-129 is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies, particularly in the context of cervical cancer screening and vaccination programs.",
