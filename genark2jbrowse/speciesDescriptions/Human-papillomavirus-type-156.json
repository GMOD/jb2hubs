  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 156 (HPV-156) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species. HPV-156 is a specific type of human papillomavirus that has been identified and characterized through genetic analysis.\n\nHPV-156 is a double-stranded, circular DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several early and late genes that are responsible for the virus's replication, transcription, and assembly. Like other HPV types, HPV-156 is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual contact, and it can cause a range of benign and potentially precancerous lesions on the skin and mucosal surfaces of the human body.\n\nThe clinical significance and epidemiological characteristics of HPV-156 are still under investigation, as it is a relatively rare and less-studied HPV type compared to some of the more common and well-known HPV types, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, which are known to be associated with a higher risk of developing cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers.",
