  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 63 (HPV63) is a species of the Papillomavirus genus within the Papillomaviridae family. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that infects the epithelial cells of the human skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV63 is classified as a low-risk type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. It is primarily associated with the development of common warts, also known as verrucae vulgaris, which are benign skin growths that can occur on various parts of the body.\n\nThe genome of HPV63 consists of approximately 7,900 base pairs and encodes for several viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which can contribute to cellular transformation and the development of warts. However, the risk of progression to malignancy is significantly lower compared to high-risk HPV types.\n\nHPV63 is considered a relatively uncommon HPV type and is not included in most commercial HPV detection or vaccination strategies. Its prevalence and distribution can vary depending on the geographical region and the population studied.",
