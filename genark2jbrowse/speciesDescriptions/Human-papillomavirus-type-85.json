  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 85 (HPV85) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. HPV85 is a type of human papillomavirus that belongs to the alpha papillomavirus genus, specifically the alpha-9 species.\n\nHPV85 is primarily associated with the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, which are precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. Like other high-risk HPV types, HPV85 can integrate its DNA into the host cell genome, leading to the disruption of cellular regulatory pathways and the uncontrolled proliferation of infected cells.\n\nThe HPV85 genome consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are responsible for the transformation and immortalization of infected cells.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that HPV85 is a relatively rare HPV type, with a global prevalence of less than 1% among cervical cancer cases. However, its presence in some regions highlights the importance of comprehensive HPV screening and vaccination programs to prevent the development of cervical cancer and other HPV-related diseases.",
