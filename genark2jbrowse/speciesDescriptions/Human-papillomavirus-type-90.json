  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 90 (HPV90) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various hosts, including humans. HPV90 is classified as a genus Alphapapillomavirus, a subgroup of HPVs that primarily infect the skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV90 is considered a low-risk HPV type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. However, it can still cause the formation of benign warts or papillomas, which are small, elevated growths on the skin or mucous membranes.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV90 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes several essential proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and assembly. Like other HPVs, HPV90 requires the host cell's machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles, which can then be transmitted to other individuals through direct contact or exposure to contaminated surfaces.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that HPV90 is relatively uncommon compared to other HPV types, and its prevalence and distribution may vary depending on the geographic region and population being studied. Understanding the characteristics and distribution of HPV90 is important for healthcare professionals in developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies for HPV-related diseases.",
