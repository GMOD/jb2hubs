  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) type 96 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. HPV-96 is a member of the Alpha-papillomavirus genus, which primarily infects the genital and oral regions.\n\nHPV-96 is considered a low-risk type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. However, it can still lead to the formation of benign warts or papillomas, which are localized overgrowths of epithelial cells.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV-96 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes several essential proteins responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the manipulation of the host cell's machinery. Like other HPV types, HPV-96 has a tropism for keratinocytes, the predominant cell type in the outermost layer of the skin and mucous membranes.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that HPV-96 is relatively uncommon compared to other HPV types, but it can be found in various geographic regions and populations. The transmission of HPV-96 typically occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.\n\nWhile HPV-96 infections are generally less concerning than those caused by high-risk HPV types, they can still have clinical significance, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or in cases where they lead to the development of persistent or recurrent warts.",
