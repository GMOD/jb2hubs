  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a family of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes. There are over 100 different types of HPV, and they are classified based on their genetic makeup and the types of cells they infect.\n\nHPV is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact. Some HPV types can cause warts, while others are associated with the development of certain types of cancer, such as cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers.\n\nThe HPV genome contains circular, double-stranded DNA that encodes for several viral proteins, including those involved in viral replication, gene expression, and the manipulation of the host cell's machinery. These proteins play a crucial role in the virus's ability to evade the host's immune response and establish a persistent infection.\n\nHPV infections are common, and many individuals may be infected without experiencing any visible symptoms. However, persistent infection with certain \"high-risk\" HPV types can lead to the development of precancerous lesions, which, if left untreated, can progress to cancer over time.\n\nVaccines have been developed to prevent infection with the most common high-risk HPV types, and regular screening, such as Pap smears and HPV testing, are essential for the early detection and management of HPV-related diseases.",
