  "description": "Human pegivirus 2 (HPgV-2) is a recently discovered RNA virus that belongs to the Pegivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is closely related to the previously known human pegivirus (HPgV), also known as GB virus C (GBV-C).\n\nHPgV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that primarily infects human cells. The virus is believed to be transmitted through blood and blood products, similar to its close relative, HPgV/GBV-C.\n\nThe genome of HPgV-2 is approximately 9.4 kilobases in length and encodes for several viral proteins, including the structural proteins (core and envelope) and non-structural proteins involved in viral replication and assembly.\n\nWhile the exact prevalence and clinical significance of HPgV-2 infection are still under investigation, some studies have suggested that it may be associated with certain medical conditions, such as liver disease and immunodeficiency. However, more research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential health implications of this newly discovered virus.",
