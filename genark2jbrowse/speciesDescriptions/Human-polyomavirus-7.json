  "description": "Human polyomavirus 7 (HPyV7) is a member of the Polyomaviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses. HPyV7 was first identified in 2010 from skin samples of healthy individuals.\n\nThe HPyV7 genome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 5,200 base pairs. It encodes several key proteins, including the large T antigen and small T antigen, which are essential for viral replication and manipulation of the host cell's machinery.\n\nHPyV7 is believed to establish a persistent, asymptomatic infection in the skin and other tissues of healthy individuals. The prevalence of HPyV7 infection in the general population is estimated to be around 30-50%. However, the exact role and pathogenic potential of HPyV7 in human health and disease are still under investigation.\n\nSome studies have suggested potential associations between HPyV7 and certain skin conditions, such as non-melanoma skin cancer, but more research is needed to fully understand the clinical implications of HPyV7 infection. Ongoing investigations aim to elucidate the epidemiology, tissue tropism, and potential pathogenic mechanisms of this recently discovered human polyomavirus.",
