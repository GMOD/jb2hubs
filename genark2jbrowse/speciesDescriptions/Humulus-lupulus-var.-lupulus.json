  "description": "Humulus lupulus var. lupulus, commonly known as the common hop or European hop, is a perennial, dioecious, climbing vine belonging to the Cannabaceae family. It is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America.\n\nThe plant has a long, twining stem that can reach up to 6 meters in length and is covered in rough, downward-pointing hairs. The leaves are broadly ovate, deeply lobed, and have a characteristic rough, wrinkled texture. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and dioecious, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants.\n\nThe female plants produce the characteristic hop cones, which are green, papery, and contain lupulin glands that produce a variety of secondary metabolites, including bitter resins and essential oils. These compounds are widely used in the brewing industry to impart bitterness, aroma, and stability to beer.\n\nHumulus lupulus var. lupulus is a commercially important crop, with its cultivation and use in beer production dating back centuries. It is also cultivated for ornamental purposes and has a long history of use in traditional medicine.",
