  "description": "Hyaena hyaena, commonly known as the striped hyena, is a medium-sized carnivorous mammal belonging to the family Hyaenidae. It is found in North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia.\n\nThe striped hyena is characterized by its distinctive striped coat, which can range in color from greyish-brown to reddish-brown. It has a robust, stocky build with a sloping back, powerful jaws, and large teeth adapted for crushing bones. The striped hyena is a scavenger, feeding primarily on carrion and various types of small to medium-sized prey.\n\nThese hyenas are typically nocturnal and live in a variety of habitats, including deserts, grasslands, and mountainous regions. They are known for their social behavior, living in small family groups or clans and engaging in complex communication through vocalizations and body language.\n\nThe striped hyena plays an important role in the ecosystem, acting as a natural scavenger and helping to maintain the balance of the food chain. Despite their ecological significance, some populations of the striped hyena are threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and conflict with human activities.",
