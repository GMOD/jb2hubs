It is primarily found in Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and parts of China.\n\nHyalomma asiaticum is a medium-sized tick, with adults typically measuring around 5-8 millimeters in length. The body is oval-shaped and covered in a hard, chitinous exoskeleton. The tick's coloration can range from grayish-brown to reddish-brown, with distinctive white or yellowish markings on the dorsal surface.\n\nThis species is known to feed on a variety of hosts, including livestock (such as cattle, sheep, and goats), as well as wild mammals, birds, and occasionally humans. Hyalomma asiaticum is considered a vector of several important zoonotic diseases, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a potentially severe viral illness.\n\nTaxonomically, Hyalomma asiaticum is classified within the genus Hyalomma, which is one of the largest genera of hard ticks. The species is recognized for its adaptation to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it plays a significant role in the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases affecting both human and animal populations in the region.",
