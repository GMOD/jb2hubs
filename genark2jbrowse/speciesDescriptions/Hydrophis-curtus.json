  "description": "Hydrophis curtus, commonly known as the short-nosed sea snake, is a species of venomous marine snake belonging to the subfamily Hydrophiinae. This species is native to the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the eastern coast of Africa to northern Australia.\n\nHydrophis curtus is a relatively small sea snake, typically measuring between 60 to 90 centimeters in length. It has a stout, laterally compressed body and a short, blunt head, which is characteristic of the genus Hydrophis. The snake's coloration is variable, ranging from shades of gray, olive, or brown, often with darker crossbands or bars along the body.\n\nThis species is highly adapted to a fully aquatic lifestyle, with a paddle-like tail and valvular nostrils that allow it to remain submerged for extended periods. Hydrophis curtus primarily feeds on small fish and eels, which it hunts in the shallow coastal waters and estuaries it inhabits.\n\nAs a member of the Hydrophiinae subfamily, Hydrophis curtus is venomous and possesses a potent neurotoxin that can be dangerous to humans. However, the species is generally not considered highly aggressive, and incidents of envenomation are relatively rare.",
