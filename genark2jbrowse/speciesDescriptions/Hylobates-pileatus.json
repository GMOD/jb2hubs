  "description": "Hylobates pileatus, commonly known as the pileated gibbon, is a species of gibbon native to the forests of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. It is a small, arboreal primate belonging to the family Hylobatidae.\n\nThe pileated gibbon is characterized by its distinctive black fur and a prominent white crest or \"cap\" on the top of its head, which gives the species its common name. They are known for their agile and acrobatic movements through the forest canopy, swinging from branch to branch using their long, powerful arms.\n\nThese gibbons are primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and insects. They live in small family groups, typically consisting of a mated pair and their offspring. They are known for their complex and melodious vocalizations, which play a crucial role in social communication and maintaining pair bonds.\n\nThe pileated gibbon is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for the pet trade and traditional medicine. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and anti-poaching measures, are essential for the survival of this arboreal primate species.",
