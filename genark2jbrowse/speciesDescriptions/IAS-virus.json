  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no species known as the \"IAS virus\". This appears to be a made-up or fictitious name, as there is no known virus by that designation. Viruses are typically named based on the disease they cause, the organism they infect, or other identifying characteristics. Without more information about the specific properties or context of this \"IAS virus\", I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Viruses are microscopic infectious agents that can only replicate within the living cells of other organisms, but a description of a made-up virus would be speculative at best. Let me know if you have any other questions about real, documented viruses and I'll be happy to provide a scientific overview.",
