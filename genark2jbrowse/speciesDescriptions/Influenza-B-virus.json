  "description": "Influenza B virus is a type of the influenza virus that primarily infects humans. It is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, a group of enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The Influenza B virus genome consists of eight gene segments that encode for various viral proteins, including the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).\n\nInfluenza B virus is known to cause seasonal epidemics, typically occurring during the winter months in temperate regions. Unlike Influenza A virus, which can infect a wide range of hosts, Influenza B virus is mainly restricted to humans, with occasional infections in seals and small whales. The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.\n\nInfluenza B virus can cause a range of respiratory illnesses, from mild, self-limiting cases to more severe manifestations, such as pneumonia and exacerbations of underlying medical conditions. Vaccination is the primary means of prevention, as it can provide protection against specific Influenza B virus strains that are predicted to circulate during a given influenza season.",
