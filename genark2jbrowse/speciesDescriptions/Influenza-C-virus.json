  "description": "Influenza C virus is a member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, a group of negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. It is the only species in the genus Influenzavirus C, which is distinct from the better-known Influenzavirus A and Influenzavirus B genera.\n\nThe Influenza C virus particle is spherical or pleomorphic in shape, with a diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nanometers. The viral genome consists of seven RNA segments that encode at least nine different proteins, including the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) and the nucleoprotein (NP).\n\nUnlike Influenza A and B viruses, Influenza C virus lacks the neuraminidase surface protein and primarily causes mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, particularly in children. Transmission occurs mainly through direct contact and large respiratory droplets, and the virus does not typically cause widespread seasonal epidemics.\n\nInfluenza C virus has a narrower host range compared to Influenza A and B, primarily infecting humans and pigs. It is less prevalent and less studied than the other influenza virus types, but it remains an important pathogen that can contribute to respiratory illness, especially in vulnerable populations.",
