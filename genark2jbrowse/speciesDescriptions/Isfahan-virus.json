  "description": "Isfahan virus is a species of virus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus, which is part of the Bunyavirales order. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus.\n\nIsfahan virus was first isolated in 1973 from sandflies collected in the city of Isfahan, Iran. It is primarily transmitted by sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus and can infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, rodents, and livestock.\n\nThe virus is known to cause a febrile illness in humans, often accompanied by non-specific symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In some cases, more severe manifestations, such as neurological complications, have been reported.\n\nGenetically, Isfahan virus is closely related to other members of the Phlebovirus genus, such as Toscana virus and Sandfly fever Sicilian virus, which are also transmitted by sand flies and can cause similar clinical presentations in humans.\n\nResearch on Isfahan virus is ongoing to better understand its epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential impact on public health, particularly in regions where the virus is endemic.",
