  "description": "Jaculus jaculus, commonly known as the lesser Egyptian jerboa, is a small rodent species belonging to the family Dipodidae. It is native to North Africa and parts of the Middle East, inhabiting arid and semi-arid regions, such as deserts and steppes.\n\nThe lesser Egyptian jerboa is a nocturnal and highly adapted desert-dwelling animal. It has a distinctive morphology, with a small, elongated body, large hind limbs, and a long, tufted tail that is used for balance and jumping. The animal's hind legs are much longer than its front legs, allowing it to move by powerful leaps, which can reach up to 2.5 meters in distance.\n\nThe lesser Egyptian jerboa has a grayish-brown fur coat that provides camouflage in its desert environment. It is a herbivorous species, feeding primarily on various plant materials, such as seeds, leaves, and roots. The jerboa has evolved physiological adaptations, including the ability to conserve water and thermo-regulate, to survive in the harsh desert climate.\n\nThis species is known for its social behavior, often living in small family groups or colonies, and communicating through a variety of vocalizations and scent marking. The lesser Egyptian jerboa plays an important role in the desert ecosystem, serving as a prey species for various predators, such as foxes, owls, and snakes.",
