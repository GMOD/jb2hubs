  "description": "Jeju virus is a newly discovered virus that was first isolated from Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks collected on Jeju Island, South Korea. It belongs to the Jingmenvirus genus within the Peribunyaviridae family.\n\nThe Jeju virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a tripartite genome. Its genome consists of three segments: the small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the glycoprotein (Gn and Gc), and the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n\nPhylogenetic analyses have shown that the Jeju virus is closely related to other viruses within the Jingmenvirus genus, such as the Jingmen tick virus and the Kindia virus. These viruses have been found in various tick species and are believed to be transmitted by ticks to vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinical significance of the Jeju virus are still under investigation. As a newly discovered virus, further research is needed to understand its potential impact on human and animal health.",
