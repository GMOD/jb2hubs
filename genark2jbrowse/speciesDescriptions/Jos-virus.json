  "description": "Jos virus is a species of virus belonging to the Orthonairovirus genus, which is part of the Nairoviridae family. It is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks.\n\nThe Jos virus was first isolated in 1967 from Amblyomma variegatum ticks collected in Jos, Nigeria. It is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, where it has been detected in various tick species and occasionally in human and animal samples.\n\nThe virus has a genome composed of three segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The virion is roughly spherical in shape and lacks a lipid envelope.\n\nWhile the clinical significance of Jos virus in humans is not well-established, some studies have suggested that it may be associated with mild febrile illness. However, further research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of this virus.",
