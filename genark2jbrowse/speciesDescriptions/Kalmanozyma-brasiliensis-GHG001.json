  "description": "Kalmanozyma brasiliensis GHG001 is a species of yeast belonging to the phylum Ascomycota. It was isolated from a soil sample collected in Brazil.\n\nKalmanozyma brasiliensis GHG001 is a unicellular fungal organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically oval-shaped and measure approximately 3-5 micrometers in size.\n\nThis species is known to be able to grow and thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including a wide range of temperatures and pH levels. It has been observed to utilize a diverse array of carbon and nitrogen sources for its metabolism and energy production.\n\nGenetically, the genome of Kalmanozyma brasiliensis GHG001 has been sequenced and analyzed, revealing insights into its evolutionary relationships, metabolic capabilities, and potential biotechnological applications. Further research is ongoing to explore the ecological roles and biotechnological potential of this yeast species.",
