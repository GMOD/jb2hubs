  "description": "Kasokero virus is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus, which belongs to the family Peribunyaviridae. It is an enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The Kasokero virus was first isolated in 1976 from Crocidura olivieri shrews collected in Uganda.\n\nThe Kasokero virus genome consists of three segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the two surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n\nKasokero virus is primarily maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving rodents and arthropod vectors, particularly mosquitoes. The virus has been found to be serologically related to other Orthobunyaviruses, such as Bunyamwera virus and Germiston virus, which are also primarily associated with rodent and mosquito hosts.\n\nLimited information is available on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations associated with Kasokero virus infections in humans. Further research is needed to better understand the potential public health and veterinary significance of this virus.",
