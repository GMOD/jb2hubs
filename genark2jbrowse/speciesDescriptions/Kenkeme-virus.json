  "description": "Kenkeme virus is a member of the genus Orthobunyavirus, which belongs to the family Peribunyaviridae. It is a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\n\nThe Kenkeme virus was first isolated in 1969 from Culex mosquitoes collected in the Kenkeme River basin in the Primorsky Krai region of the Russian Far East. It is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes and has been detected in various parts of eastern Russia.\n\nThe virus is known to infect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, but its pathogenicity and potential impact on human or animal health are not well-established. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, host range, and clinical significance of the Kenkeme virus.",
