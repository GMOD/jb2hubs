  "description": "Kogia breviceps, commonly known as the pygmy sperm whale, is a small species of whale belonging to the family Kogiidae. It is one of the smallest members of the order Cetacea, typically measuring between 2.7 to 3.8 meters in length as adults.\n\nThe pygmy sperm whale has a rounded, stocky body with a short, blunt snout and a small, hooked dorsal fin located in the middle of its back. Its coloration is generally dark gray to bluish-gray on the upper body, with a paler gray or white underside.\n\nThese whales are found in tropical and temperate waters throughout the world's oceans, typically in deep, offshore waters. They are elusive and difficult to observe in the wild, as they tend to avoid vessels and often submerge for long periods.\n\nPygmy sperm whales are believed to feed primarily on small squid, fish, and crustaceans. They use their sharp teeth to capture and consume their prey. The species is considered to have a relatively low reproductive rate, with females typically giving birth to a single calf every few years.\n\nDue to their inconspicuous nature and limited population data, the conservation status of the pygmy sperm whale is classified as \"Data Deficient\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
