  "description": "Kunjin virus (KUNV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serogroup within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It is an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, particularly Culex annulirostris, which is the principal vector in Australia.\n\nKUNV is closely related to the West Nile virus (WNV) and shares many genetic and serological similarities. It was first isolated in 1960 from mosquitoes collected in the Kunjin region of Western Australia. The virus is primarily found in Australia and Papua New Guinea, and its natural transmission cycle involves birds as the primary vertebrate hosts.\n\nInfection with KUNV in humans can cause a range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to severe neuroinvasive disease, such as encephalitis, meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis. The severity of the disease is often influenced by host factors, such as age and underlying medical conditions.\n\nDiagnosis of KUNV infection typically involves serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays, to detect the presence of KUNV-specific antibodies. Treatment is primarily supportive, as there are no specific antiviral therapies available. Prevention strategies focus on mosquito control and personal protective measures, such as the use of insect repellents and protective clothing.",
