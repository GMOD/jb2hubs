  "description": "Kwoniella bestiolae CBS 10118 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, order Tremellales, and family Trichosporonaceae. It was first isolated from the gut of the isopod Armadillidium vulgare, also known as the common pill bug or roly-poly.\n\nThe cells of Kwoniella bestiolae CBS 10118 are typically round to oval-shaped, and they reproduce asexually through budding. The species is able to assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and trehalose, and it can grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on ribosomal DNA sequences have shown that Kwoniella bestiolae CBS 10118 is closely related to other Kwoniella species, which are known to be associated with various invertebrate hosts, such as insects and crustaceans. The ecological role of Kwoniella bestiolae within the gut microbiome of the common pill bug is still under investigation.",
