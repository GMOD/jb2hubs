  "description": "Kwoniella dendrophila CBS 6074 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, and order Tremellales. It was first isolated from decaying wood samples collected in Germany.\n\nKwoniella dendrophila CBS 6074 is a basidiomycetous yeast that reproduces asexually through budding. Cells are typically spherical to ellipsoidal in shape, with a diameter ranging from 3 to 6 micrometers. The species can grow on a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and various alcohols.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA sequences has placed Kwoniella dendrophila CBS 6074 within the genus Kwoniella, a group of yeast species found in diverse environments, including decaying wood, soil, and the digestive tracts of animals.\n\nThis species is considered to be a saprotroph, meaning it can utilize organic matter in its environment as a source of nutrients for growth and metabolism. Its ecological role likely involves the decomposition of woody plant material in its natural habitat.",
