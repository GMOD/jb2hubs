  "description": "La Crosse virus (LACV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family, specifically the genus Orthobunyavirus. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by the eastern tree hole mosquito (Aedes triseriatus) in the United States.\n\nLACV is a neurotropic virus, meaning it has a particular affinity for infecting and replicating within the central nervous system. Infection with LACV can lead to the development of La Crosse encephalitis, a potentially severe form of viral encephalitis (brain inflammation) that primarily affects children.\n\nThe virus is believed to be maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving small rodents, such as chipmunks and squirrels, which serve as the primary reservoir hosts. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on these infected rodents and can then transmit the virus to humans through their bites.\n\nLACV is primarily found in the Midwestern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, with the highest incidence reported in the states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois. Ongoing research aims to better understand the ecology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of this important arboviral disease.",
