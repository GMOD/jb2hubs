  "description": "Labrus bergylta, commonly known as the ballan wrasse, is a species of wrasse fish that belongs to the family Labridae. It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Norway to the Canary Islands, including the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe ballan wrasse is a large, robust fish that can grow up to 60 cm in length. It has a distinctive oval-shaped body with a large, protruding mouth and thick lips. The body coloration varies greatly, ranging from shades of brown, green, and yellow, with dark blotches or stripes on the sides. The dorsal fin has 18-21 spines, while the anal fin has 3 spines.\n\nBallan wrasses are typically found in coastal areas, near rocky reefs, kelp beds, and seagrass beds, where they feed on a variety of prey, including mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish. They are known to be territorial and often form small social groups.\n\nReproduction in Labrus bergylta involves a complex social system, with individuals changing sex from female to male as they grow larger. The spawning season typically occurs in the spring and summer months, during which the males display elaborate courtship behaviors to attract females.\n\nBallan wrasses are commercially important in some regions, where they are targeted for their meat and also used in aquaculture as cleaner fish to control sea lice infestations in salmon farms.",
