  "description": "Labrus mixtus, commonly known as the cuckoo wrasse, is a species of wrasse fish found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a member of the Labridae family, which includes various species of wrasses.\n\nThe cuckoo wrasse is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 30 centimeters (12 inches). It has a distinctive coloration, with males displaying a vibrant blue and orange pattern, while females are typically more drab in appearance, often with a greenish-brown hue.\n\nLabrus mixtus is a protogynous hermaphrodite, meaning individuals can change sex from female to male as they mature. This species is known to inhabit coastal areas, often found in rocky or coral reef habitats, where they feed on a variety of small invertebrates and crustaceans.\n\nThe cuckoo wrasse plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, contributing to the overall diversity and balance of the marine community. It is also of commercial importance, as it is sometimes targeted by recreational and small-scale commercial fisheries.",
