  "description": "Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens DSM 5016 = JCM 6985 is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, homofermentative lactic acid bacterium that was isolated from kefir grains. It is a subspecies of the species Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, which is known for its ability to produce the exopolysaccharide kefiran.\n\nThis particular strain, DSM 5016 = JCM 6985, was originally isolated from traditional kefir grains and has been extensively studied for its role in the fermentation and production of kefir, a fermented milk beverage. The strain is characterized by its efficient production of kefiran, a water-soluble, branched glucogalactan that contributes to the unique texture and mouthfeel of kefir.\n\nLactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens is considered a probiotic microorganism due to its potential health benefits, including the modulation of the gut microbiome, anti-inflammatory properties, and the ability to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria. Its use in the production of kefir and other fermented dairy products has been of great interest in the food and beverage industry.",
