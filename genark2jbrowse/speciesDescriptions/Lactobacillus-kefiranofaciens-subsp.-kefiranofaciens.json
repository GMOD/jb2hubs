  "description": "Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium. It is a subspecies of the species Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, which is known to be a predominant member of the microbial community found in kefir, a fermented dairy product.\n\nThe distinguishing features of L. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens include its ability to produce large amounts of the exopolysaccharide kefiran, which contributes to the characteristic texture and mouthfeel of kefir. This subspecies is also capable of metabolizing a variety of carbohydrates, including lactose, glucose, and fructose, as part of its fermentative metabolism.\n\nL. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefiranofaciens is commonly isolated from kefir grains and plays a crucial role in the fermentation process, contributing to the development of the unique flavor, aroma, and probiotic properties of kefir. Its presence and activity are essential for the production of this traditional fermented dairy beverage.",
