  "description": "Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum DSM 10550 = JCM 8572 is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Lactobacillus genus. It is a member of the Lactobacillaceae family and is considered a subspecies of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens.\n\nThis bacterium was initially isolated from kefir grains, a traditional fermented dairy product. It is known for its ability to produce kefiran, a polysaccharide that contributes to the unique texture and properties of kefir. The strain DSM 10550 (also known as JCM 8572) is the type strain of the L. kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum subspecies.\n\nLactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. kefirgranum is a homofermentative lactic acid bacterium, meaning it primarily produces lactic acid as the end product of carbohydrate fermentation. It has been studied for its potential probiotic properties and its role in the fermentation and production of kefir.\n\nThe genome of this subspecies has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, carbohydrate utilization, and potential mechanisms involved in kefiran production. Ongoing research aims to further explore the characteristics and applications of this Lactobacillus strain in the food and biotechnology industries.",
