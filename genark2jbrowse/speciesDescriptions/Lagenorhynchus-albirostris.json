  "description": "Lagenorhynchus albirostris, commonly known as the white-beaked dolphin, is a species of dolphin found in the cold waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. It is a member of the genus Lagenorhynchus, which includes several species of small to medium-sized dolphins.\n\nThe white-beaked dolphin is characterized by its robust build, rounded head, and distinctive coloration. The body is dark gray on the back and sides, with a white or pale belly. The most distinguishing feature is the white or pale beak, which contrasts with the darker coloration of the rest of the head.\n\nThese dolphins typically grow to a length of 2.4-3.1 meters (7.9-10.2 feet) and can weigh up to 350 kilograms (770 pounds). They are known to be social animals, often observed in groups of 2-20 individuals.\n\nThe white-beaked dolphin is a generalist predator, feeding on a variety of fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are found in coastal and offshore waters, with a range extending from the western coast of Greenland to the eastern coast of the United States.\n\nThis species is not considered to be endangered, although it may face threats from pollution, climate change, and human activities such as fishing and maritime traffic. Conservation efforts aim to monitor and protect the white-beaked dolphin populations in their natural habitats.",
