  "description": "The Lake Victoria marburgvirus, also known as Ci67, is a highly pathogenic member of the Filoviridae family, which includes the Ebola virus. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects humans and non-human primates.\n\nThe Lake Victoria marburgvirus is named after the location where it was first discovered, the Lake Victoria region in Africa. The Ci67 strain is a specific isolate of this virus that was identified during an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1967.\n\nThis virus is known to cause a severe and often fatal viral hemorrhagic fever, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, unexplained bleeding or bruising, and sometimes organ failure and death. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces, and there is currently no approved vaccine or specific treatment for the disease it causes.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance are crucial to understanding the epidemiology, ecology, and potential means of controlling this highly dangerous pathogen, which continues to pose a significant public health threat in affected regions.",
