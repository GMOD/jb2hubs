  "description": "Lake Victoria marburgvirus - DRC1999 is a strain of the Marburgvirus, a member of the Filoviridae family. Marburgviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates.\n\nThe Lake Victoria marburgvirus - DRC1999 strain was isolated during an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1999. This strain is genetically distinct from other Marburgvirus strains, such as the original Marburg virus isolated in Marburg, Germany, in 1967.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that the Lake Victoria marburgvirus - DRC1999 strain is closely related to the Marburg virus strains found in Uganda, suggesting a common geographic origin in the Lake Victoria region of Africa. The virus is believed to be transmitted to humans primarily through contact with infected fruit bats, which are the natural reservoir host for Marburgviruses.\n\nInfection with the Lake Victoria marburgvirus - DRC1999 strain can lead to a severe and often fatal illness, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. The case fatality rate for this strain is estimated to be around 80%.\n\nEffective prevention and control measures, as well as the development of vaccines and treatments, are critical for addressing the threat posed by the Lake Victoria marburgvirus - DRC1999 and other Marburgvirus strains.",
