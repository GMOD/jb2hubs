  "description": "The Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Leiden is a highly pathogenic filovirus that belongs to the genus Marburgvirus, family Filoviridae. It is the causative agent of Marburg virus disease, a severe and often fatal illness in humans and non-human primates.\n\nThe virus is enveloped and has a characteristic filamentous, thread-like morphology. Its genome consists of a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA molecule that encodes seven structural proteins essential for viral replication and assembly.\n\nThe Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Leiden strain was first isolated from a patient who had traveled to Uganda and contracted the disease. It is closely related to, but distinct from, the other known Marburg virus strains, reflecting the genetic diversity within the Marburgvirus genus.\n\nInfection with the Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Leiden strain can lead to an acute, severe, and often fatal illness characterized by fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, unexplained bleeding or bruising, and multiple organ dysfunction. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces and objects.\n\nEffective treatment and control measures are crucial, as the Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Leiden is considered a significant public health threat due to its high virulence and potential for outbreaks, particularly in resource-limited settings.",
