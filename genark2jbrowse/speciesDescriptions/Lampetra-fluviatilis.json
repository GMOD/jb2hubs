  "description": "Lampetra fluviatilis, commonly known as the river lamprey, is a species of jawless fish belonging to the order Petromyzontiformes. It is a small, eel-like creature that is native to Europe, inhabiting rivers, streams, and coastal areas from the White Sea to the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe river lamprey is characterized by a sucker-like, circular mouth surrounded by horny teeth, which it uses to attach to and feed on the blood and tissues of other fish. It has a slender, elongated body and a series of gill openings along the sides. The adults typically range from 25 to 40 centimeters in length.\n\nThe life cycle of the river lamprey involves a larval stage, known as an ammocoete, which lives buried in the sediment of streams and rivers for several years, feeding on algae and detritus. After metamorphosis, the adult lamprey migrates to the sea or larger rivers, where it parasitizes on host fish, often Atlantic salmon or trout. The adults then return to freshwater to spawn, completing their life cycle.\n\nThe river lamprey is an important part of the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, serving as both a predator and a prey species. Its conservation status is generally considered to be of \"Least Concern\" due to its widespread distribution and relatively stable populations, although it may face threats from habitat degradation and human activities in some regions.",
