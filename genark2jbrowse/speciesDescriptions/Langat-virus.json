  "description": "Langat virus (LGTV) is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by hard-bodied ticks of the Ixodes genus.\n\nLGTV was first isolated in 1955 from Ixodes granulatus ticks collected in the Langat district of Selangor, Malaysia. It is primarily found in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, where it circulates in a sylvatic cycle involving small mammals and ticks.\n\nWhile LGTV is generally considered less virulent than other TBEV complex viruses, it can cause mild febrile illness in humans, occasionally leading to aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. The virus is primarily maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving ticks and small rodents, with humans serving as incidental hosts.\n\nLGTV is closely related to, but distinct from, the more clinically significant TBEV that causes tick-borne encephalitis in Europe and Asia. Understanding the ecology, epidemiology, and molecular characteristics of LGTV contributes to the broader knowledge of the TBEV complex and the development of effective prevention and control strategies for tick-borne diseases.",
