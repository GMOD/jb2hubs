  "description": "The Langya virus (LayV) is a newly emerged zoonotic virus that belongs to the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. It was first identified in 2019 in Shandong and Henan provinces of China, where it was detected in patients with febrile illness.\n\nThe Langya virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 18 kilobases in length and encodes for several structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and attachment (G) proteins.\n\nEpidemiological investigations suggest that the Langya virus is likely maintained in shrews (a small insectivorous mammal) as its natural reservoir host. Human infections with the Langya virus have been reported, but the transmission dynamics and the risk of human-to-human transmission are still under investigation.\n\nThe clinical presentation of Langya virus infection in humans includes fever, fatigue, cough, loss of appetite, and various other nonspecific symptoms. Severe cases may develop complications like pneumonia and multi-organ dysfunction. However, the overall severity and case-fatality rate of Langya virus infections are still being assessed.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the ecology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of the Langya virus, as well as to develop effective diagnostic tests, treatment strategies, and preventive measures against this emerging zoonotic threat.",
