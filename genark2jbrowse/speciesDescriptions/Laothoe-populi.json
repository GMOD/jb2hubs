  "description": "Laothoe populi, commonly known as the poplar hawk-moth or grey poplar hawk-moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sphingidae. It is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, ranging from the United Kingdom to Japan.\n\nThe Laothoe populi is a medium-sized moth, with a wingspan of approximately 80-100 millimeters. The forewings are greyish-brown with darker patches, while the hindwings are pinkish-grey. The body is stout and robust, with a well-developed proboscis (feeding tube) used for feeding on nectar from various flowering plants.\n\nThe larvae, or caterpillars, of the Laothoe populi are typically green in color with diagonal white stripes along their bodies. They feed primarily on the leaves of poplar trees (Populus spp.), from which the species derives its common name. The caterpillars undergo a remarkable transformation, developing a prominent horn-like structure on their posterior end, which is characteristic of many hawk-moth species.\n\nThe Laothoe populi is considered a nocturnal species, with adults typically active during the night and resting during the day. They play an important ecological role as pollinators, contributing to the reproduction of various plant species through their nectar-feeding behavior.",
