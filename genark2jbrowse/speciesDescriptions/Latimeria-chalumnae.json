  "description": "Latimeria chalumnae, also known as the coelacanth, is a species of fish that is considered a living fossil. It is the only known living member of the order Coelacanthiformes, a group of fish that were thought to have been extinct for millions of years.\n\nThe coelacanth is a large, robust fish, with a distinctive rounded body shape, lobed fins, and a broad, rounded head. It can grow up to 2 meters in length and can weigh up to 90 kilograms. The fish has a unique internal skeletal structure, with a hollow, cartilaginous skeleton that is different from most other bony fish.\n\nCoelacanths are found in deep ocean habitats, typically at depths of 100 to 700 meters, in the western Indian Ocean, off the coasts of South Africa, Tanzania, and the Comoros Islands. They are slow-moving, nocturnal predators that feed on a variety of small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nThe coelacanth is considered a critically endangered species, with a small population size and a limited geographic range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ancient fish species.",
