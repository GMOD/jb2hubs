  "description": "Leishmania braziliensis MHOM/BR/75/M2904 is a protozoan parasite belonging to the genus Leishmania, which is responsible for causing the disease known as American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) or \"Espundia\" in South America. This specific strain was isolated in 1975 from a human patient in Brazil.\n\nLeishmania braziliensis is a digenetic parasite, meaning it has two distinct life stages: the promastigote (flagellated, motile form) and the amastigote (non-flagellated, intracellular form). The promastigotes are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies, primarily of the genus Phlebotomus or Lutzomyia. Once inside the human host, the promastigotes are engulfed by macrophages and transform into the amastigote form, which can then multiply and spread to other cells, leading to the development of cutaneous lesions.\n\nThe M2904 strain of L. braziliensis is considered a reference strain and has been extensively studied to understand the biology, genetics, and pathogenesis of this important human pathogen. It serves as a model for investigating the host-parasite interactions, immunological responses, and the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches for the management of American cutaneous leishmaniasis.",
