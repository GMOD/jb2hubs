  "description": "Leishmania major strain Friedlin is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Leishmania, which is responsible for causing cutaneous leishmaniasis, a type of leishmaniasis disease. Leishmania major is one of the main causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis in various regions of the world, including the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa.\n\nThe Friedlin strain of Leishmania major is a well-studied and widely used laboratory strain that has been extensively characterized. It was originally isolated from a patient with cutaneous leishmaniasis in Friedlin, Iran, and has become a model organism for the study of Leishmania biology, host-parasite interactions, and the development of therapeutic interventions.\n\nLeishmania major is a digenetic parasite, meaning it has two distinct life stages: the promastigote form, which is found in the gut of the sand fly vector, and the amastigote form, which is found within the host's macrophage cells. The Friedlin strain has been used to investigate various aspects of Leishmania biology, including its genome organization, gene expression, and metabolic pathways, as well as its interactions with the host immune system and the mechanisms of pathogenesis.\n\nThe availability of the Friedlin strain and its comprehensive characterization have made it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of leishmaniasis, contributing to our understanding of the disease and the development of new strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.",
