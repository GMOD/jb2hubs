  "description": "Leishmania tarentolae is a species of protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Leishmania. It is a member of the Trypanosomatidae family and is classified as a kinetoplastid organism.\n\nLeishmania tarentolae is primarily found in the Mediterranean region, where it infects the gecko species Tarentola mauritanica, also known as the Moorish gecko. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sand flies, which act as the vector for the infection.\n\nIn its life cycle, Leishmania tarentolae alternates between a flagellated promastigote form, which is found in the gut of the sand fly vector, and an amastigote form, which resides within the phagocytic cells of the host, such as macrophages and dendritic cells.\n\nUnlike many other Leishmania species that can cause severe and sometimes life-threatening diseases in humans, such as leishmaniasis, Leishmania tarentolae is not known to be pathogenic to humans. Instead, it has been studied extensively as a model organism for the Leishmania genus, particularly in the areas of molecular biology, genetics, and drug discovery.\n\nDue to its non-pathogenic nature and the availability of various genetic tools and techniques, Leishmania tarentolae has become a valuable system for the study of Leishmania biology, the development of novel drug candidates, and the production of recombinant proteins for various applications.",
