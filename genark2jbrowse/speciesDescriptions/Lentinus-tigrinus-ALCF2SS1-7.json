  "description": "Lentinus tigrinus ALCF2SS1-7 is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Agaricomycetes, and order Polyporales. It is a wood-decay fungus that is commonly known as the tiger sawgill or tiger mushroom.\n\nThe species is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruiting bodies that have a convex to flat cap with a distinctive tiger-striped pattern. The gills on the underside of the cap are decurrent, meaning they extend down the stem. The stem is generally short and central. The spore print is white, and the spores are elliptical in shape.\n\nLentinus tigrinus ALCF2SS1-7 is typically found growing on the dead or decaying wood of various tree species, often in clusters or overlapping groups. It is known to play a role in the decomposition of woody plant material, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems.\n\nThis particular strain, ALCF2SS1-7, may exhibit specific genetic or physiological characteristics that differentiate it from other Lentinus tigrinus strains or populations. Further research would be needed to elucidate the unique properties or adaptations of this particular isolate.",
