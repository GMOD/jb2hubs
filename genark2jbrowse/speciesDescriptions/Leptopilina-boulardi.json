  "description": "Leptopilina boulardi is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Figitidae. It is a natural enemy of certain Drosophila fly species, which are commonly known as fruit flies.\n\nLeptopilina boulardi is a small wasp, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. It has a slender body, a dark brown or black coloration, and a distinct head with large compound eyes. The female wasp is equipped with a long, needle-like ovipositor that it uses to lay its eggs inside the larvae of Drosophila flies.\n\nThe lifecycle of Leptopilina boulardi begins when the female wasp detects a suitable Drosophila larva and injects an egg into it. The wasp egg then hatches, and the larval wasp feeds on the host Drosophila larva, eventually killing it. The wasp larva then pupates within the Drosophila host, emerging as an adult wasp that continues the cycle.\n\nLeptopilina boulardi is considered an important biological control agent for some Drosophila species that can be agricultural pests. By parasitizing and killing the Drosophila larvae, the wasp helps to reduce the population of these flies, which can be beneficial for fruit and vegetable growers.",
