  "description": "Leptospira adleri is a species of pathogenic bacteria that belongs to the genus Leptospira. It is a spiral-shaped, obligately aerobic, and motile bacterium that is known to cause leptospirosis, a serious and potentially fatal zoonotic disease.\n\nLeptospira adleri is classified as a member of the Leptospira interrogans serogroup and is commonly found in the kidneys of small rodents and other wild animals, which serve as its natural reservoirs. The bacteria can be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals or their urine, or through exposure to contaminated water or soil.\n\nInfection with Leptospira adleri can lead to a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe forms of leptospirosis, such as Weil's disease, which can involve organ failure and hemorrhage. Early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment are crucial for the successful management of leptospirosis caused by this species.",
