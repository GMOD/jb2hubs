  "description": "Leptospira andrefontaineae is a species of pathogenic bacteria that belongs to the genus Leptospira. It is a spirochete bacterium, meaning it has a spiral or helical shape, and is known to cause leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that can affect humans and various animal species.\n\nLeptospira andrefontaineae was first isolated and identified in 2017 from water samples collected in the Auvergne region of France. It is named after the French microbiologist Andr√© Fontaine, who made significant contributions to the understanding of leptospirosis.\n\nThe species is characterized by its small size, typically measuring between 6-20 micrometers in length and 0.1-0.2 micrometers in width. Like other Leptospira species, L. andrefontaineae possesses a unique dual-membrane structure and is known to be motile, using its axial flagella for movement.\n\nGenetically, L. andrefontaineae is classified within the pathogenic Leptospira clade and is closely related to other pathogenic Leptospira species, such as L. interrogans and L. kirschneri. The species is believed to be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated water or soil, or indirect contact with the urine of infected animals.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to understand the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and potential public health implications of Leptospira andrefontaineae, as it represents a newly discovered species within the Leptospira genus.",
