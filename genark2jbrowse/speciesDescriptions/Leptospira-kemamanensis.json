  "description": "Leptospira kemamanensis is a species of pathogenic bacteria that belongs to the genus Leptospira. It was first isolated and identified from environmental samples collected in Kemaman, Malaysia.\n\nLeptospira kemamanensis is a spiral-shaped, gram-negative bacterium that is classified as a member of the Leptospiraceae family. It is an obligate aerobe, meaning it requires oxygen to grow and thrive. The bacterium is characterized by its ability to move through the use of endoflagella, which are flagella located within the periplasmic space of the cell.\n\nGenetically, Leptospira kemamanensis has been found to be distinct from other known Leptospira species based on DNA-DNA hybridization and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The bacterium is considered a potential pathogen and has been associated with cases of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that can affect both humans and animals.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, virulence factors, and clinical significance of Leptospira kemamanensis in the context of human and animal health.",
