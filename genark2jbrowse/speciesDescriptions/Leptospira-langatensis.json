  "description": "Leptospira langatensis is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Leptospira, which are spirochetes known to cause the infectious disease leptospirosis in various animal species and humans. This particular species was first isolated from a water sample collected in Langat River, Malaysia, and is classified within the pathogenic group of Leptospira species.\n\nLeptospira langatensis is a thin, helical-shaped bacterium that measures approximately 6-12 μm in length and 0.1 μm in width. It possesses two flagella that provide the bacterium with its characteristic spiral motility. Genetically, L. langatensis has been classified as a distinct species within the Leptospira genus based on molecular analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence and other genomic features.\n\nThe natural reservoir hosts and transmission dynamics of L. langatensis are not yet fully understood, as research on this relatively newly described species is still limited. However, like other pathogenic Leptospira, it is likely capable of infecting a range of mammalian hosts and can potentially be transmitted through contact with contaminated water or soil. Further studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology and clinical significance of this Leptospira species.",
