  "description": "Leptospira licerasiae ATCC BAA-1110 is a spirochete bacterium that belongs to the genus Leptospira. It is a fastidious, obligately aerobic, and motile microorganism. Leptospira licerasiae was first isolated from a patient with leptospirosis in Peru and was subsequently named after the city of Iquitos, where the initial isolate was obtained.\n\nThis species of Leptospira is considered a pathogenic strain, capable of causing leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that can infect both humans and animals. Leptospira licerasiae is transmitted primarily through contact with contaminated water or soil, or exposure to the urine of infected animals.\n\nGenetically, Leptospira licerasiae has been classified as a distinct genomospecies within the Leptospira genus, based on DNA-DNA hybridization and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses. It is known to possess a range of virulence factors and adaptive mechanisms that enable its survival and pathogenicity in various host environments.\n\nThe ATCC BAA-1110 strain is the type strain for Leptospira licerasiae and has been used in various research studies to understand the biology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestations associated with this spirochete species.",
