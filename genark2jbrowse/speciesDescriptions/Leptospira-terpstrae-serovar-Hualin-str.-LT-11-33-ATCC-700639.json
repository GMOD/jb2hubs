  "description": "Leptospira terpstrae serovar Hualin str. LT 11-33 = ATCC 700639 is a pathogenic strain of the bacterium Leptospira terpstrae, which belongs to the genus Leptospira. Leptospira terpstrae is a spirochete, a type of bacteria characterized by their spiral or helical shape.\n\nThe Hualin strain (LT 11-33 = ATCC 700639) of Leptospira terpstrae serovar Hualin is a pathogenic variant that has been isolated and characterized. Serovars are distinct antigenic types within a Leptospira species, and the Hualin serovar is one of the identified serovars of Leptospira terpstrae.\n\nLeptospira terpstrae is known to cause leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that can infect both animals and humans. The Hualin strain has been used in research and diagnostic applications, as it serves as a reference strain for studying the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and detection of Leptospira terpstrae infections.",
