  "description": "Leptospira wolbachii serovar Codice str. CDC is a subspecies of the bacterium Leptospira wolbachii, which belongs to the genus Leptospira. Leptospira are spiral-shaped, obligate aerobic bacteria that are known to cause the infectious disease leptospirosis in humans and animals.\n\nThe serovar Codice is a specific serological variant of Leptospira wolbachii, which is distinguished by its unique antigenic properties. The \"str. CDC\" indicates that this particular strain was isolated and characterized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nLeptospira wolbachii serovar Codice str. CDC is a pathogenic strain that can potentially infect and cause leptospirosis in susceptible hosts. The bacteria are typically transmitted through contact with contaminated water, soil, or the urine of infected animals. Infection can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, from mild flu-like illness to severe complications such as organ failure and hemorrhage.\n\nUnderstanding the specific characteristics of Leptospira wolbachii serovar Codice str. CDC is important for epidemiological surveillance, diagnostics, and the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for leptospirosis.",
