  "description": "Lepus americanus, commonly known as the snowshoe hare or varying hare, is a species of hare found in North America. It is a medium-sized mammal belonging to the family Leporidae.\n\nThe snowshoe hare is characterized by its large hind legs and large, heavily furred feet that act as \"snowshoes,\" enabling it to move easily through deep snow. Its fur changes color seasonally, with a white coat in winter and a brown or grayish coat in summer, providing camouflage in different environments.\n\nThis species is known for its remarkable ability to change its coat color in response to seasonal variations in the environment. The hare's molt is triggered by changes in day length, allowing it to blend in with the surrounding landscape and avoid predation.\n\nSnowshoe hares are herbivores, feeding on a variety of plants, including grasses, herbs, and the bark and twigs of shrubs and trees. They play an important role in the ecosystem as a prey species, contributing to the food web and supporting populations of predators such as lynx, coyotes, and birds of prey.\n\nThe snowshoe hare is widely distributed across the boreal and mountainous regions of North America, ranging from Alaska and Canada to the northern United States. Its habitat includes coniferous and mixed forests, as well as subalpine and tundra regions.",
