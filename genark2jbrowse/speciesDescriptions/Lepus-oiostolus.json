  "description": "Lepus oiostolus, commonly known as the woolly hare or Tibetan hare, is a species of hare found in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the genus Lepus, which includes various species of hares and jackrabbits.\n\nThe woolly hare is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Tibetan Plateau. It has a thick, woolly coat that provides insulation in the cold, dry climate. The fur is typically grayish-brown in color, which helps the hare blend in with the rocky and snowy landscape. The species has large, broad feet that act as snowshoes, enabling it to move efficiently through the deep snow.\n\nLepus oiostolus is herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other alpine vegetation. It is a crepuscular animal, being most active during the dawn and dusk hours. The hare is an important prey species for predators in its ecosystem, such as foxes, wolves, and birds of prey.\n\nThe woolly hare is found at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,500 meters above sea level, making it one of the highest-dwelling mammals in the world. It is adapted to the low oxygen levels and harsh environmental conditions of the Tibetan Plateau, demonstrating the remarkable ability of species to thrive in even the most extreme habitats.",
