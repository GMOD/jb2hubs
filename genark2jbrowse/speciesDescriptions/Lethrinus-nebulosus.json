  "description": "Lethrinus nebulosus, commonly known as the spangled emperor or largescale seabream, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Lethrinidae, the emperors or scavengers. It is a demersal species found in the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea and East Africa to southern Japan and northern Australia.\n\nThe spangled emperor is a moderately sized fish, typically reaching lengths of around 30-60 cm. It has a stout, ovate body shape with a relatively large, slightly protruding mouth. The coloration is variable, ranging from pale gray to yellowish-brown, with dark blotches and spots scattered across the body. The fins are often tinted with yellow or orange.\n\nThis species is an opportunistic carnivore, feeding on a variety of benthic organisms, including crustaceans, mollusks, and small fishes. It is often found near coral reefs, seagrass beds, and other coastal habitats, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a predator and scavenger.\n\nLethrinus nebulosus is of commercial importance and is commonly targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. It is also sometimes kept in public aquariums due to its relatively hardy nature and attractive appearance.",
