  "description": "Limanda limanda, commonly known as the common dab or lemon sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish, meaning it lives and feeds near the bottom of the ocean.\n\nThe common dab has a flat, oval-shaped body with both eyes on the right side of the head. Its upper side, or eyed side, is typically brown or olive-green in color, while the underside, or blind side, is white. The fish can grow up to 40 cm in length but is more commonly found in the range of 20-30 cm.\n\nLimanda limanda is distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, from the Barents Sea to the Bay of Biscay, and is commonly found in coastal waters, estuaries, and on sandy or muddy seabeds. It feeds primarily on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other benthic organisms.\n\nThe common dab is an important commercial species, targeted by both commercial and recreational fisheries. It is valued for its firm, white flesh and is often consumed as a food fish.",
