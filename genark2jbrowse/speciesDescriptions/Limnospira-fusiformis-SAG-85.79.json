  "description": "Limnospira fusiformis SAG 85.79 is a species of unicellular, freshwater green algae that belongs to the class Chlorophyceae. It is a member of the genus Limnospira, which is characterized by its fusiform (spindle-shaped) cell morphology.\n\nThis particular strain, SAG 85.79, was isolated and deposited in the Sammlung von Algenkulturen der Universität Göttingen (SAG) culture collection. As a freshwater species, Limnospira fusiformis SAG 85.79 is typically found in various aquatic environments, such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams.\n\nThe cells of Limnospira fusiformis SAG 85.79 are generally elongated and spindle-shaped, with a length of approximately 10-30 micrometers and a width of 3-7 micrometers. The cells possess a single, cup-shaped chloroplast and a prominent pyrenoid, which is a structure associated with carbon fixation and starch storage.\n\nLimnospira fusiformis SAG 85.79 is known to reproduce asexually through the formation of autospores, which are small, non-motile daughter cells that are released from the parent cell and develop into new individuals.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in biofuel production, wastewater treatment, and as a source of valuable biochemicals, such as lipids and pigments.",
