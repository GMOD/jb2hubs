  "description": "Lingula anatina is a species of brachiopod, a type of marine invertebrate animal. It is a member of the phylum Brachiopoda, which are filter-feeding organisms that live attached to the seafloor.\n\nLingula anatina is characterized by its distinctive elongated, tongue-shaped shell that is composed of two hinged valves. The shell is typically greenish-brown in color and can reach up to 10 cm in length. The animal lives buried in sandy or muddy sediments, with only the tip of its shell protruding above the surface.\n\nLingula anatina is known for its exceptional longevity, with some individuals living for over 100 years. It is considered a \"living fossil\" as it has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years, with the earliest known fossils dating back to the Ordovician period, over 450 million years ago.\n\nThis species is found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in coastal areas of East Asia, from Japan to the Philippines and Indonesia. Lingula anatina plays an important role in the benthic ecosystems it inhabits, serving as a food source for various predators and contributing to the cycling of nutrients in the seafloor sediments.",
