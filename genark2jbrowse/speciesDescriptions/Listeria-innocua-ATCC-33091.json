  "description": "Listeria innocua ATCC 33091 is a non-pathogenic bacterium that belongs to the genus Listeria. It is a Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. Listeria innocua ATCC 33091 is a close relative of the pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes, but it lacks the virulence factors that make L. monocytogenes a foodborne pathogen. \n\nThis strain, ATCC 33091, was isolated from the environment and is commonly used as a model organism or surrogate for the study of Listeria species in food safety and environmental microbiology. It exhibits similar growth characteristics and biochemical properties to L. monocytogenes, making it a useful tool for understanding the behavior and detection of Listeria in various settings, without the risk of working with a pathogenic strain.\n\nListeria innocua ATCC 33091 is frequently used in research to investigate topics such as Listeria ecology, survival, and inactivation under different environmental conditions, as well as the development and evaluation of detection and identification methods for the genus Listeria.",
