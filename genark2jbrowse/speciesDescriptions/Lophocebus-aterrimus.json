  "description": "Lophocebus aterrimus, commonly known as the black crested mangabey, is a species of primate belonging to the genus Lophocebus, which is part of the Old World monkey family Cercopithecidae. This medium-sized monkey is native to central Africa, primarily found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Lophocebus aterrimus is characterized by its distinctive black fur and a prominent crest of hair on the top of its head. This crest is particularly prominent in males and is thought to play a role in social signaling and communication within the species. The species is arboreal, spending most of its time in the canopy of dense, humid forests, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and insects.\n\nLophocebus aterrimus exhibits a complex social structure, living in multi-male, multi-female groups with a clear hierarchy. These groups engage in various social behaviors, such as grooming, play, and vocalizations, which are believed to help maintain group cohesion and social bonds. The species is considered threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for bushmeat.",
