  "description": "Lutra lutra, commonly known as the Eurasian otter or common otter, is a semi-aquatic mammal species belonging to the family Mustelidae. It is found throughout Europe and Asia, inhabiting a wide range of freshwater and coastal habitats, including rivers, lakes, marshes, and estuaries.\n\nThe Eurasian otter is a streamlined, long-bodied animal with a rounded head, short legs, and a thick, tapered tail. Its fur is dense and waterproof, typically dark brown or black on the back and lighter on the belly. Adaptations for its aquatic lifestyle include webbed feet, a flexible spine, and the ability to close its ears and nose when diving.\n\nOtters are primarily piscivorous, feeding mainly on fish, but they also consume crustaceans, amphibians, and small mammals. They use their sensitive whiskers and dexterous paws to locate and capture prey, often hunting in the water or along the banks of their habitat.\n\nLutra lutra is a highly social species, with individuals living in family groups and demonstrating complex social behaviors. They are known for their playful and agile nature, often observed sliding down banks or engaging in other playful activities.\n\nThe Eurasian otter is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and anti-poaching measures, are crucial for the long-term survival of this ecologically important species.",
