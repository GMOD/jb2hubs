  "description": "Lycocorax pyrrhopterus obiensis is a subspecies of the Moluccan Crow, a bird species native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It is a medium-sized corvid with predominantly black plumage, with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration on the wings and tail.\n\nThis subspecies is found specifically on the island of Obi, part of the Maluku Islands. It inhabits tropical moist lowland and montane forests, where it feeds on a variety of foods, including insects, small vertebrates, and fruits.\n\nLycocorax pyrrhopterus obiensis is considered a distinct subspecies due to its unique morphological characteristics, such as its slightly larger size and the more extensive reddish-brown coloration on its wings and tail compared to other populations of the Moluccan Crow.\n\nThe subspecies is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as it maintains a stable population and its habitat is relatively well-preserved within its limited range on the island of Obi.",
