  "description": "Lymnaea stagnalis, commonly known as the greater pond snail or the common pond snail, is a species of freshwater snail that belongs to the family Lymnaeidae. It is a common and widely distributed species found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams throughout Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nLymnaea stagnalis is a hermaphroditic species, meaning each individual has both male and female reproductive organs. The shell of the snail is coiled, typically light brown or yellowish in color, and can grow up to 45-50 millimeters in length. The snail's body is soft and slimy, with a large foot used for locomotion.\n\nThese snails are important components of freshwater ecosystems, serving as prey for various predators and playing a role in the cycling of nutrients. They are generally considered to be good indicators of water quality, as they are sensitive to environmental changes and pollutants.\n\nLymnaea stagnalis has been extensively studied in the field of neurobiology and behavioral science, as its relatively simple nervous system and complex behavioral repertoire make it a valuable model organism for understanding the mechanisms of learning, memory, and neuroplasticity.",
