It belongs to the family Megadermatidae, which are a group of carnivorous bats.\n\nKey features of Lyroderma lyra:\n\n1. Appearance: It has a large, triangular-shaped head, large ears, and a distinctive nose-leaf structure that resembles a lyre, hence the name \"lyra\". The fur is typically dark brown or grayish-brown in color.\n\n2. Size: It is one of the largest species of false vampire bats, with a wingspan ranging from 80 to 100 cm and a body length of around 15-20 cm.\n\n3. Feeding Habits: Lyroderma lyra is an obligate carnivore, feeding primarily on small vertebrates such as birds, rodents, and even other bats. It uses its sharp canine teeth to capture and consume its prey.\n\n4. Echolocation: As a megabat, Lyroderma lyra relies more on vision than echolocation for navigation and hunting, although it does possess some limited echolocation abilities.\n\n5. Habitat and Distribution: The greater false vampire bat is found in parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, typically inhabiting dense forests, caves, and abandoned buildings.\n\n6. Conservation Status: The species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although some local populations may face threats from habitat loss and hunting.\n\nThis bat species plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystem, contributing to the regulation of small vertebrate populations and the dispersal of seeds through its feeding activities.",
