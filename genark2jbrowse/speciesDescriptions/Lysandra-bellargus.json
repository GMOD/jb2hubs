  "description": "Lysandra bellargus, commonly known as the Adonis blue, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is native to Europe, with its range extending from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Asia.\n\nThe Adonis blue is a small to medium-sized butterfly, with a wingspan typically ranging from 30 to 36 millimeters. The upper side of the male's wings is a vivid, iridescent blue, while the female's wings are brown with blue patches near the body. The underside of both sexes is predominantly gray with distinctive white-edged spots.\n\nThe Adonis blue is associated with calcareous grasslands, where its larval host plants, such as various species of Hippocrepis and Anthyllis, are found. The larvae feed on the flowers and young pods of these plants, and the adults primarily feed on the nectar of small, open flowers.\n\nThis species is sensitive to changes in its habitat and is considered threatened in some parts of its range due to factors such as habitat loss, overgrazing, and climate change. Conservation efforts have been implemented in certain regions to protect the Adonis blue and its fragile ecosystem.",
