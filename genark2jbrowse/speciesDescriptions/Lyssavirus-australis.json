  "description": "Lyssavirus australis is a species of virus that belongs to the Lyssavirus genus, which is a group of viruses known to cause rabies and rabies-like illnesses in various animals. The Lyssavirus australis is specifically found in Australia and is believed to be associated with bat populations in the region.\n\nAs a member of the Lyssavirus genus, Lyssavirus australis is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The virus is primarily transmitted through the bite or contact with the saliva of infected bats, and it can cause a fatal neurological disease in humans and other mammals, similar to the clinical manifestations of classic rabies.\n\nThe genome of Lyssavirus australis consists of approximately 12,000 nucleotides and encodes five main structural proteins, which are essential for the viral replication and infection process. The virus is known to have a relatively limited host range, primarily infecting certain species of bats found in Australia.\n\nWhile the Lyssavirus australis is not as widely studied as the classic rabies virus, it is still considered a public health concern in regions where it is present, and appropriate preventive measures and awareness are necessary to minimize the risk of infection and transmission to humans and other susceptible animals.",
