  "description": "Lyssavirus mokola is a species of virus that belongs to the Lyssavirus genus within the Rhabdoviridae family. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, usually a wild mammal such as a bat or rodent.\n\nThe Lyssavirus mokola is one of the less common lyssaviruses and has primarily been found in parts of Africa, particularly in Nigeria and Cameroon. It is closely related to other lyssaviruses, such as the rabies virus, in terms of its genetic makeup and the clinical symptoms it can cause in infected individuals.\n\nLike other lyssaviruses, Lyssavirus mokola can cause a fatal neurological disease known as rabies, which is characterized by symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, agitation, delirium, hallucinations, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, and ultimately, paralysis and death if left untreated. However, the specific epidemiology and transmission patterns of Lyssavirus mokola are not as well-studied or understood as those of the more common rabies virus.\n\nOverall, Lyssavirus mokola represents a relatively rare but potentially dangerous zoonotic pathogen that can pose a public health threat in certain regions of Africa where it has been detected.",
