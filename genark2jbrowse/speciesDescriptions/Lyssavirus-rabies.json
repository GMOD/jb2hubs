  "description": "Lyssavirus rabies, also known as the rabies virus, is a highly contagious and deadly zoonotic disease caused by a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Lyssavirus within the family Rhabdoviridae. The rabies virus is primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, most commonly from bats, dogs, and other carnivorous mammals.\n\nThe virus primarily targets the central nervous system, causing a progressive and fatal encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in both humans and animals. Symptoms typically manifest within 1-3 months after exposure and include anxiety, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, hypersalivation, difficulty swallowing, and ultimately, paralysis and coma.\n\nRabies is considered one of the most lethal infectious diseases, with a mortality rate approaching 100% in untreated cases. However, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment, involving a series of vaccines and immunoglobulin injections, is highly effective in preventing the onset of the disease if administered promptly after exposure.\n\nContinuous efforts to vaccinate domestic animals, control wildlife reservoirs, and raise public awareness have led to a significant decline in rabies incidence in many parts of the world, though the disease remains a major public health concern in developing regions with limited access to PEP and animal vaccination programs.",
