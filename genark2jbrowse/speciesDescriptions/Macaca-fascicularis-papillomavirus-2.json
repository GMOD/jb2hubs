  "description": "The Macaca fascicularis papillomavirus 2 (MfPV2) is a type of DNA virus that belongs to the genus Treisdeltapapillomavirus within the family Papillomaviridae. This virus primarily infects the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis), a species of Old World monkey native to Southeast Asia.\n\nMfPV2 is a small, non-enveloped virus with a circular, double-stranded DNA genome. The viral genome encodes various proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and host cell manipulation. Like other papillomaviruses, MfPV2 is known to induce the formation of benign skin and mucosal lesions, such as warts, in its natural host.\n\nThe virus is believed to be transmitted through direct contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. MfPV2 has been studied as a model system for understanding the biology and pathogenesis of papillomaviruses, as well as their potential interactions with the host immune system.",
