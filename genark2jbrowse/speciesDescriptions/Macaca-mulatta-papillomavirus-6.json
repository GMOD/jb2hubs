  "description": "The Macaca mulatta papillomavirus 6 (MmPV6) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans and non-human primates. MmPV6 is specifically found in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), a species of Old World monkey native to parts of Asia.\n\nThe viral genome of MmPV6 is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that contains approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other papillomaviruses, MmPV6 encodes a set of early (E) and late (L) genes that are responsible for viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation. The virus is typically found in the mucosal epithelial cells of the host, where it can cause the development of benign proliferative lesions, such as papillomas or warts.\n\nMmPV6 is of interest to researchers as a model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary relationships within the Papillomaviridae family, as well as its potential implications for the health and management of rhesus macaque populations in the wild or in captivity.",
