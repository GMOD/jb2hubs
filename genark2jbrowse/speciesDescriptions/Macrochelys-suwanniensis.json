  "description": "Macrochelys suwanniensis is a species of alligator snapping turtle found in the Suwannee River basin in Florida, United States. It is a large, freshwater turtle known for its massive, heavily armored shell and powerful jaws.\n\nThe carapace (upper shell) of M. suwanniensis is typically dark brown or black in color and has three prominent ridges running along its length. The plastron (lower shell) is off-white or pale yellow. The head is large and triangular, with a hooked beak-like upper jaw and numerous small spikes or tubercles on the skin.\n\nThese turtles are carnivorous, primarily feeding on fish, crustaceans, and small mammals or birds that venture near the water's edge. They use their modified tongues, which resemble worms, to lure in prey. Once the prey is within reach, the turtle's powerful jaws can easily crush and consume it.\n\nM. suwanniensis is considered a distinct species from the closely related alligator snapping turtle (Macrochelys temminckii) found in other parts of the southeastern United States. The species is classified as Endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and overharvesting for the pet trade and food consumption.",
