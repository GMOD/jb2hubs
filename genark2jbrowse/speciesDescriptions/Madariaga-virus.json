  "description": "Madariaga virus is a mosquito-borne virus that belongs to the genus Alphavirus, which is part of the family Togaviridae. It was first isolated in 1961 from mosquitoes collected in Panama. The virus is primarily transmitted by Culex and Aedes mosquitoes and can infect various vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nMadariaga virus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 11.5 kilobases in length and encodes four structural proteins (capsid, envelope 1, envelope 2, and 6K) and four non-structural proteins involved in viral replication and transcription.\n\nInfection with Madariaga virus can cause a febrile illness in humans, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, and arthralgia. In some cases, more severe neurological complications, such as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, have been reported. The virus is primarily found in Central and South America, where it is considered an emerging public health concern.\n\nOngoing research is focused on understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential for further geographic expansion of Madariaga virus, as well as the development of effective diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic interventions.",
