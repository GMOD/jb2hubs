  "description": "Magallana angulata, also known as the Angulated Oyster, is a species of oyster that belongs to the family Ostreidae. It is native to the coastal waters of East Asia, particularly along the coasts of China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nThe Angulated Oyster is characterized by its distinctive shell shape, which is typically elongated and angular, with a pronounced ridge or keel running along the length of the shell. The shell surface is usually rough and uneven, with a grayish-brown or greenish-brown coloration.\n\nThese oysters typically inhabit intertidal and subtidal zones, often attaching themselves to rocky substrates or other hard surfaces. They are filter feeders, using their gills to extract phytoplankton and other small particles from the surrounding water for nourishment.\n\nMagallana angulata is of commercial importance in some regions, as it is harvested for human consumption. The species is also of ecological significance, as it plays a role in the overall functioning of the coastal ecosystems where it is found.",
