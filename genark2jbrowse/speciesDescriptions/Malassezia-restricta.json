  "description": "Malassezia restricta is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. It is a lipophilic (fat-loving) fungus that is commonly found on the skin of humans and other warm-blooded animals.\n\nMalassezia restricta is a small, oval-shaped yeast that reproduces asexually by budding. It has a smooth, creamy-white appearance and can form colonies on agar media. The species is characterized by its ability to utilize lipids as a primary carbon source, which allows it to thrive in the lipid-rich environment of the skin.\n\nMalassezia restricta is considered a commensal organism, meaning it is typically found on the skin without causing any harm. However, it has been associated with various skin conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and atopic dermatitis, in individuals with a predisposition or underlying skin conditions.\n\nThe distribution and prevalence of Malassezia restricta on the skin can vary depending on factors such as age, geographic location, and individual skin characteristics. It is commonly found on the scalp, face, and other sebum-rich areas of the body.\n\nResearchers continue to study the role of Malassezia restricta in skin health and disease, as understanding its interactions with the host and the overall skin microbiome is important for developing effective treatment and management strategies for associated skin conditions.",
