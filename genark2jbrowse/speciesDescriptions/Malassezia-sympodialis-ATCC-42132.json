  "description": "Malassezia sympodialis ATCC 42132 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. It is a lipophilic (fat-loving) organism, meaning it requires lipids or fatty acids for growth and survival.\n\nMalassezia sympodialis is a commensal organism, which means it typically lives on the skin of humans and other warm-blooded animals without causing any harm. However, under certain conditions, it can become an opportunistic pathogen and contribute to the development of various skin conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe ATCC 42132 strain is a reference strain of M. sympodialis that is widely used in research and diagnostic settings. It has been extensively studied to understand the biology, ecology, and pathogenic potential of this yeast species.\n\nMorphologically, M. sympodialis ATCC 42132 is a small, round to oval-shaped yeast that reproduces by budding. It has a characteristic multilayered cell wall and can form pseudohyphae (elongated, branching structures) under certain growth conditions.\n\nGenetically, M. sympodialis ATCC 42132 has been sequenced and its genome has been analyzed, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, virulence factors, and evolutionary relationships with other Malassezia species.\n\nOverall, the study of M. sympodialis ATCC 42132 has contributed to our understanding of the role of this yeast in human health and disease, and it continues to be an important model organism for investigating the biology and pathogenesis of Malassezia species.",
