  "description": "Malassezia vespertilionis is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. It was first isolated from the skin of bats (Vespertilionidae family) in 2013. Malassezia vespertilionis is a lipophilic, or lipid-dependent, yeast, meaning it requires lipids or fatty substances for growth and survival.\n\nThe cells of Malassezia vespertilionis are typically round to oval in shape and reproduce by budding. The species is known to be a part of the normal skin microbiota of bats and has been found to be associated with various skin conditions in these animals, such as dermatitis and hyperpigmentation.\n\nGenetically, Malassezia vespertilionis is closely related to other Malassezia species that are commonly found on the skin of humans and other animals. However, it is considered a distinct species due to its unique genetic and physiological characteristics, as well as its specific association with bats.\n\nResearch on Malassezia vespertilionis is ongoing, and further studies are needed to understand its role in the health and ecology of bat populations, as well as its potential interactions with other microorganisms in the bat skin microbiome.",
