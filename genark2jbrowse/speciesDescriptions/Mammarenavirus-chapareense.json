  "description": "Mammarenavirus chapareense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus, which is part of the family Arenaviridae. Arenaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that primarily infect rodents as their natural hosts.\n\nMammarenavirus chapareense was first identified in Bolivia and is known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans, called Chapare hemorrhagic fever. The virus is transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected rodents or their excreta, or through exposure to aerosolized virus particles.\n\nThe genome of Mammarenavirus chapareense consists of two single-stranded RNA segments, designated as the small (S) and large (L) segments. The S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), while the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the zinc-binding protein (Z).\n\nMammarenavirus chapareense is considered an emerging pathogen, and its distribution and potential for further spread are still being investigated. Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and host-virus interactions of this virus is crucial for developing effective preventive and therapeutic measures against Chapare hemorrhagic fever.",
