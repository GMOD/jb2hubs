  "description": "Mammarenavirus guanaritoense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus, which is a part of the family Arenaviridae. This virus was first isolated from rodents of the species Zygodontomys brevicauda, commonly known as the short-tailed cane mouse, in the Gu√°rico State of Venezuela.\n\nMammarenavirus guanaritoense is an enveloped, single-stranded, ambisense RNA virus. It has a genome composed of two segments, one encoding the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and the other encoding the viral glycoprotein (GP) and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). The virus is known to be capable of infecting and causing disease in rodents, and there is a potential risk of zoonotic transmission to humans, although the extent of its impact on human health is not well-established.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, host range, and pathogenic mechanisms of this specific Mammarenavirus species. Continued surveillance and investigation of this virus are important for assessing its public health significance and potential impact on both animal and human populations.",
