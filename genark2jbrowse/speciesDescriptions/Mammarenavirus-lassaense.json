  "description": "Mammarenavirus lassaense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus, which is part of the Arenaviridae family. This virus is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a severe and potentially fatal viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic to parts of West Africa.\n\nThe Mammarenavirus lassaense virion is enveloped and has a spherical or pleomorphic shape. It has a genome composed of two single-stranded, ambisense RNA segments that encode four proteins: the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), the nucleoprotein (NP), the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), and a small zinc-finger protein (Z).\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with the urine, feces, or body fluids of its natural reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). Human-to-human transmission can also occur, particularly in healthcare settings. Lassa fever is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising.\n\nMammarenavirus lassaense is considered a significant public health concern in affected regions, and research is ongoing to develop effective treatments and vaccines to prevent and control the spread of Lassa fever.",
