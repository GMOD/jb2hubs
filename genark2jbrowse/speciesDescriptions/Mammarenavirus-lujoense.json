  "description": "Mammarenavirus lujoense is a species of virus that belongs to the Mammarenavirus genus within the Arenaviridae family. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects rodents as its natural hosts.\n\nThe Mammarenavirus lujoense virus was first isolated in 1987 from the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) in Lujoka, Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is classified as a member of the Lassa virus complex within the Mammarenavirus genus, which also includes other pathogenic viruses such as Lassa virus and Lujo virus.\n\nGenetically, Mammarenavirus lujoense is closely related to other Lassa-like viruses found in West and Central Africa. It is believed to be transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected rodents or their excreta, or by consuming contaminated food or water. The virus can cause a severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic fever in humans, similar to the clinical manifestations of Lassa fever.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of Mammarenavirus lujoense, as it remains a relatively understudied member of the Arenaviridae family.",
