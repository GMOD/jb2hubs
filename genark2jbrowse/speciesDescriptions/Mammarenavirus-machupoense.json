  "description": "Mammarenavirus machupoense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus, which is part of the Arenaviridae family. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, ambisense RNA virus.\n\nMammarenavirus machupoense is the causative agent of Machupo virus, which is responsible for Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, a severe and often fatal viral hemorrhagic fever that primarily affects individuals in Bolivia. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through contact with rodents, particularly the large vesper mouse (Calomys callosus), which serves as the natural reservoir.\n\nThe virus primarily targets the vascular endothelium and the immune system, leading to increased vascular permeability, coagulation abnormalities, and impaired immune response. This can result in severe bleeding, organ failure, and potentially death in untreated cases.\n\nMammarenavirus machupoense is considered a significant public health concern, particularly in endemic areas, due to its high fatality rate and the lack of approved vaccines or specific treatments. Ongoing research aims to improve understanding of the virus's biology and develop effective countermeasures to combat this deadly disease.",
