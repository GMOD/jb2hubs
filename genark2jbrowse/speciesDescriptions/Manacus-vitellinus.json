  "description": "Manacus vitellinus, commonly known as the golden-collared manakin, is a species of small passerine bird found in Central America. It belongs to the manakin family, Pipridae, which is known for the elaborate courtship displays and bright plumage of the males.\n\nThe golden-collared manakin is characterized by its striking appearance. The male has a bright golden-yellow collar around its neck, contrasting with a jet-black body and wings. Females, on the other hand, are predominantly greenish-yellow in color.\n\nThese birds are found in tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests, where they play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers. They are known for their complex courtship rituals, which involve the males performing elaborate dances and vocalizations to attract females.\n\nThe golden-collared manakin is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not facing any major threats at the moment. However, habitat loss and fragmentation remain potential concerns for the long-term conservation of this species.",
