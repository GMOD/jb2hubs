  "description": "Mandrillus leucophaeus, commonly known as the drill, is a primate species belonging to the genus Mandrillus. It is a large, stocky monkey found primarily in the rainforests of West Africa, particularly in Cameroon, Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nThe drill is characterized by its striking facial coloration, with a bright blue and red muzzle, and a gray-brown to black body. They are known for their impressive canine teeth, which are used for displays and defense. Drills are primarily terrestrial, spending most of their time on the ground, but they are also skilled climbers and can move through the trees.\n\nDrills are highly social animals, living in large troops led by a dominant male. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, insects, and small vertebrates. The species is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss and hunting for bushmeat.",
