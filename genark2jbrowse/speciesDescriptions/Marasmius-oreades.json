  "description": "Marasmius oreades, commonly known as the fairy ring mushroom or the Scotch bonnet, is a species of edible mushroom that belongs to the family Marasmiaceae. It is a saprobic fungus, meaning it decomposes organic matter and plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling in natural ecosystems.\n\nThe cap of Marasmius oreades is typically light brown or tan in color, with a diameter ranging from 2 to 5 centimeters. The cap is convex when young, becoming flatter with age, and may have a small, central depression. The gills are thin, crowded, and adnexed (attached to the stem but not running down it). The stem is slender, dry, and often twisted, with a length of 3 to 8 centimeters.\n\nThis species is known for its ability to form distinctive fairy rings, which are circular patterns of mushrooms that can grow up to several meters in diameter. These fairy rings are formed as the fungus spreads outward from a central point, decomposing organic matter and creating favorable conditions for the growth of the mushrooms.\n\nMarasmius oreades is widely distributed throughout temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia. It is commonly found in grassy areas, such as lawns, meadows, and pastures, where it can form large, often circular, colonies.\n\nThe mushroom is considered edible and has a mild, slightly nutty flavor. However, it is important to properly identify the species, as some closely related species can be toxic or cause digestive issues if consumed.",
