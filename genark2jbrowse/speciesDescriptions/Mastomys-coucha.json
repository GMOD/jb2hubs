  "description": "Mastomys coucha, also known as the multimammate mouse or Southern African mastomys, is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Mastomys. It is a small to medium-sized mouse native to parts of Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Swaziland.\n\nThe Mastomys coucha is characterized by its grayish-brown fur, which can vary in color and texture depending on its habitat. It has a rounded body, a pointed snout, and large, rounded ears. The species is known for its high reproductive capacity, with females capable of producing up to 12 litters per year, each containing up to 20 offspring.\n\nMastomys coucha is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a variety of plant materials, insects, and small vertebrates. It is often found in agricultural areas, grasslands, and human settlements, where it can become a pest species due to its ability to consume and contaminate stored grains and crops.\n\nThe species plays an important role in the ecosystem as a prey item for various predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores. It is also of importance in the study of disease transmission, as it can serve as a reservoir host for various zoonotic pathogens, including the causative agent of Lassa fever.",
