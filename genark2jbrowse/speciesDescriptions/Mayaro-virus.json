  "description": "Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. It is an emerging arbovirus primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, particularly from the Haemagogus genus, and is found in parts of Central and South America.\n\nMAYV is known to cause a Mayaro fever, an acute febrile illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, rash, and lymphadenopathy. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, and it has the potential for urban transmission due to its ability to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nGenetically, MAYV is closely related to other arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus, and shares similar clinical manifestations. However, the epidemiology and distribution of MAYV are more localized compared to some other arboviruses. Ongoing research aims to better understand the ecology, transmission dynamics, and public health impact of this emerging viral pathogen.",
