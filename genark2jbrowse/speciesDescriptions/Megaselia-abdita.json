  "description": "Megaselia abdita is a species of small fly belonging to the family Phoridae, commonly known as scuttle flies or coffin flies. These flies are characterized by their distinctive humpbacked appearance and their ability to rapidly move in a scuttling motion.\n\nMegaselia abdita is a small, dark-colored fly, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. The species is known to be found in various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it inhabits a range of habitats, such as forests, grasslands, and urban areas.\n\nAs with other Megaselia species, M. abdita is known to play a role in the decomposition of organic matter, particularly in the later stages of the process. These flies are often associated with the presence of decaying material, such as dead animals or plant matter, where they may feed on the microorganisms and other decomposing organic matter.\n\nThe biology and life cycle of M. abdita are not well-studied, but like other Phoridae, it likely undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with distinct egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larvae of this species may feed on a variety of decaying organic materials, contributing to the recycling of nutrients in the ecosystem.",
