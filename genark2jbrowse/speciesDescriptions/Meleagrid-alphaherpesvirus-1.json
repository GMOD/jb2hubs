  "description": "Meleagrid alphaherpesvirus 1 is a member of the Herpesviridae family, specifically belonging to the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), which are the natural hosts for this virus.\n\nThe virus is responsible for causing a highly contagious and economically significant disease known as turkey rhinotracheitis or avian rhinotracheitis in domestic turkey flocks. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, decreased feed intake, and reduced egg production in affected birds.\n\nMeleagrid alphaherpesvirus 1 is transmitted through direct contact with infected birds or their secretions, as well as through the inhalation of aerosolized virus particles. The virus can also be transmitted vertically from infected parent birds to their offspring.\n\nThe virus has a relatively broad host range and has been reported to infect other avian species, such as chickens and pheasants, although the severity of the disease may vary in these alternate hosts.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance efforts are crucial for understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential control strategies for this important poultry pathogen.",
