  "description": "Menangle virus is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae. It was first identified in 1997 during an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in pigs and humans in Menangle, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nThe Menangle virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 18,000 nucleotides. The virus can infect a range of mammalian hosts, including bats, pigs, and humans, and is thought to be transmitted through close contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids.\n\nThe symptoms of Menangle virus infection in humans can range from mild flu-like illness to more severe conditions, such as encephalitis and pneumonia. The virus can be transmitted from person to person, but the risk of human-to-human transmission is considered low.\n\nMenangle virus is considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen, and its potential for causing significant public health concerns has led to ongoing research and surveillance efforts to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and possible prevention and control strategies.",
