  "description": "Menidia menidia, commonly known as the Atlantic silverside, is a small, silvery-colored fish found along the Atlantic coast of North America, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to the northeastern coast of Florida in the United States.\n\nThis species belongs to the family Atherinopsidae, which are commonly referred to as silversides or silverfish. Menidia menidia is a pelagic, schooling fish that typically measures between 6 to 12 centimeters (2.4 to 4.7 inches) in length.\n\nThe Atlantic silverside has a slender, streamlined body with a distinctive silvery lateral band running along its sides. This coloration serves as camouflage, making it more difficult for predators to spot the fish in the water. The species has a small, terminal mouth and a single, long dorsal fin located towards the rear of its body.\n\nMenidia menidia is an important forage fish, providing a valuable food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and marine mammals. It plays a crucial role in the coastal and estuarine ecosystems it inhabits, contributing to the overall food web and energy dynamics. The species is also utilized as bait for recreational and commercial fisheries.",
