  "description": "Mercenaria mercenaria, commonly known as the hard clam or quahog, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Veneridae, the venus clams.\n\nMercenaria mercenaria is a filter-feeding clam that lives buried in sand or mud in coastal marine environments. It has a thick, hard, and oval-shaped shell with concentric growth rings that can be used to determine the age of the clam.\n\nThe clam feeds by using its siphons to draw in water, which it then filters to extract plankton and other organic matter for sustenance. It is an important commercial and recreational species, harvested for its edible meat.\n\nMercenaria mercenaria is widely distributed along the Atlantic coast of North America, from the Canadian Maritimes to the Gulf of Mexico. It plays a significant role in the ecology of coastal ecosystems, serving as a food source for various predators and helping to maintain water quality through its filtering activities.",
