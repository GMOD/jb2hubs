  "description": "Mesoplodon bidens, commonly known as the Sowerby's beaked whale, is a species of whale belonging to the family Ziphiidae. It is a medium-sized beaked whale, with a distinctive beak-like snout and a relatively small, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin located towards the rear of its body.\n\nSowerby's beaked whales typically range from 4.5 to 5.5 meters in length and weigh around 1,200 to 1,500 kilograms. They have a dark gray to blackish-brown coloration on their backs, which gradually lightens to a grayish-white on their bellies. Their most distinctive feature is the pair of small, upward-pointing teeth that emerge from the tip of their lower jaw in adult males.\n\nThese whales are primarily found in the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, with a range extending from Newfoundland, Canada, to the Azores and the Canary Islands in the east. They are believed to feed mainly on squid and small fish, and they are known to dive to great depths in search of their prey.\n\nSowerby's beaked whales are considered a relatively rare and elusive species, and their biology and behavior are not as well-studied as some other cetacean species. They are classified as \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, but their conservation status remains a subject of ongoing research and monitoring.",
