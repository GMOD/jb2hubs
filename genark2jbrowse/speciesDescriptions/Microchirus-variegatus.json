  "description": "Microchirus variegatus, commonly known as the variegated sole or marbled sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Soleidae. It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.\n\nThe Microchirus variegatus is a small to medium-sized flatfish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 25 centimeters (10 inches). Its body is flattened and oval-shaped, with a dark brown or grayish-brown colored upper side (the eyed side) and a white or pale-colored underside (the blind side).\n\nThe species is characterized by its distinctive variegated or marbled pattern on the upper side, which helps it camouflage on the seafloor. It has small, cycloid scales and a small, toothless mouth located on the underside of its body. Microchirus variegatus inhabits sandy or muddy benthic environments at depths ranging from a few meters to over 500 meters.\n\nIt is a predatory species, feeding primarily on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other small benthic organisms. Microchirus variegatus is an important commercial and recreational fish species in some regions of its distribution, and it is also commonly found in seafood markets.",
