  "description": "Micronycteris hirsuta, also known as the hairy big-eared bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in South and Central America, primarily in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, and Peru.\n\nThe Micronycteris hirsuta is a small-sized bat, with a body length ranging from 45 to 55 millimeters and a wingspan of approximately 250 to 290 millimeters. The species is characterized by its distinctive large ears, which are connected at the base, and its dense, woolly fur that covers the body. The fur coloration can range from reddish-brown to grayish-brown.\n\nThese bats are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, including moths, beetles, and flies. They are known to forage in both forested and open areas, using their highly sensitive echolocation abilities to locate and capture their prey.\n\nMicronycteris hirsuta is typically found roosting in caves, hollow trees, and man-made structures, such as abandoned buildings or under bridges. The species is known to form small colonies, with individuals living in close proximity to one another.\n\nThe conservation status of Micronycteris hirsuta is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the species is widely distributed and has a relatively stable population throughout its range.",
