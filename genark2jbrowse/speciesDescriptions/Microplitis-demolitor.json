  "description": "Microplitis demolitor is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is a small, solitary wasp, typically measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. The adult M. demolitor wasps are primarily black or dark brown in color, with some lighter markings on their bodies.\n\nThis species is an important biological control agent, as the female wasp lays its eggs inside the larvae of certain moth species, such as the velvetbean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis). The M. demolitor egg hatches within the host larva, and the developing wasp larva feeds on the host from the inside, eventually killing it.\n\nThe M. demolitor wasp is widely distributed across North and South America, and it plays a significant role in regulating the populations of its moth host species in agricultural ecosystems. This makes it a valuable asset in integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, as it can help reduce the need for chemical pesticides while providing natural pest control.",
