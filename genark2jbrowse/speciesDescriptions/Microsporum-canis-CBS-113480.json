It is a dermatophyte, a group of fungi that can infect the skin, hair, and nails of humans and animals.\n\nMicrosporum canis CBS 113480 is a specific strain or isolate of the species, with the CBS (Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures) number 113480 indicating its registration in the CBS culture collection.\n\nThe fungus typically grows as a mold, producing septate hyphae and numerous asexual spores called macroconidia. These macroconidia have a distinctive fusiform (spindle-shaped) appearance and are considered a key diagnostic feature of the species.\n\nMicrosporum canis is a common causative agent of ringworm (dermatophytosis) in domestic animals, especially cats and dogs, and can also infect humans, particularly children.
