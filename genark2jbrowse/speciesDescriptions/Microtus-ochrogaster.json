  "description": "Microtus ochrogaster, commonly known as the prairie vole, is a small rodent species that belongs to the genus Microtus. The prairie vole is native to the central grasslands of North America, primarily found in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe prairie vole is a small, stocky mammal with a rounded body, short legs, and a short tail. Adults typically measure between 10-15 cm in length and weigh between 30-50 grams. Their fur is typically grayish-brown in color, with a slightly darker dorsal (back) region and a lighter ventral (belly) region.\n\nThese voles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other vegetation. They are known for their complex social structure and monogamous mating system, where both male and female participate in parental care of their offspring.\n\nMicrotus ochrogaster is an important component of grassland ecosystems, serving as a prey species for various predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores. They also play a role in the dispersal of seeds and the cycling of nutrients in the soil.\n\nThe prairie vole is considered a model organism for the study of social behavior, neurobiology, and the physiological mechanisms underlying pair-bonding and parental care in mammals.",
