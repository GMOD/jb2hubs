  "description": "Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, within the family Coronaviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA virus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.\n\nMERS-CoV is primarily transmitted from dromedary camels to humans, with bats serving as the natural reservoir host. The virus can cause a severe respiratory illness in humans, known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure in some cases.\n\nThe virus primarily targets the lower respiratory tract and utilizes the human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor as its entry point into host cells. MERS-CoV has a high mortality rate, with a case-fatality rate of approximately 35% in reported cases.\n\nEffective prevention and control measures for MERS-CoV include early detection, isolation of suspected cases, and the implementation of infection control practices in healthcare settings. Ongoing research is focused on developing vaccines and therapeutic interventions to combat this emerging zoonotic threat.",
