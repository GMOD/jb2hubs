  "description": "Mirza zaza, commonly known as the Zaza dormouse, is a species of rodent belonging to the family Gliridae. It is found in the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey, particularly in the Taurus Mountains and the ZaÄŸros Mountains.\n\nThe Zaza dormouse is a small, arboreal mammal with a rounded body, large eyes, and a bushy tail. It has a greyish-brown fur coat that helps it blend in with the tree bark and branches where it spends most of its time. The species is nocturnal and primarily feeds on nuts, seeds, fruits, and insects.\n\nMirza zaza is known to hibernate during the winter months, typically from October to April, when food resources are scarce. During this time, the dormouse enters a state of torpor, slowing down its metabolism and body functions to conserve energy.\n\nThe Zaza dormouse is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its limited range and habitat loss from human activities, such as deforestation and urban development. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species and its natural environment.",
