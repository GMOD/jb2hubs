  "description": "Monkeypox virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that causes the zoonotic disease monkeypox, which is primarily found in parts of Central and West Africa.\n\nThe monkeypox virus is structurally similar to the smallpox virus, but it typically causes a less severe illness. The virus is typically transmitted to humans through close contact with infected animals, such as rodents or primates, or through contact with contaminated materials.\n\nUpon infection, the monkeypox virus can replicate within the host's cells, leading to the development of characteristic skin lesions and other symptoms, such as fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy. The virus can also be transmitted from person to person through close physical contact or exposure to contaminated materials.\n\nMonkeypox is considered an emerging infectious disease, and ongoing research is focused on understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential for global spread. Efforts are also underway to develop effective treatments and vaccines to control and prevent the disease.",
