  "description": "Monodon monoceros, commonly known as the narwhal, is a species of toothed whale that is found in the Arctic waters of the Northern Hemisphere. Narwhals are known for their distinctive spiral tusk, which is actually an elongated canine tooth that can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length.\n\nNarwhals are medium-sized whales, typically measuring between 4 to 5 meters (13 to 16 feet) in length and weighing between 800 to 1,600 kilograms (1,760 to 3,520 pounds). They have a rounded, torpedo-shaped body with a short, blunt head and a small, crescent-shaped blowhole. Their coloration is mottled, with a dark gray or black back and a lighter, sometimes white, belly.\n\nNarwhals are highly adapted to the harsh Arctic environment, with a thick layer of blubber that helps insulate them from the cold. They are skilled divers, capable of reaching depths of up to 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) and staying submerged for up to 25 minutes. Their diet consists primarily of fish, squid, and shrimp, which they locate and capture using their sensitive echolocation abilities.\n\nNarwhals are social animals, living in small pods or herds and engaging in various social behaviors, such as vocalizations and breaching. They are an important part of the Arctic ecosystem and hold cultural significance for many indigenous communities in the region.",
