  "description": "Monomorium pharaonis, commonly known as the Pharaoh ant, is a species of small, yellowish-brown ant that is widely distributed globally, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. This ant is considered an important household and industrial pest due to its ability to infest and contaminate food sources.\n\nMorphologically, Monomorium pharaonis workers are typically 2-3 millimeters in length, with a slender body, a 12-segmented antenna, and a 3-segmented club at the end of the antenna. They have a well-developed pair of mandibles and a relatively small petiole (the narrow waist-like structure between the thorax and abdomen). The Pharaoh ant is known for its ability to form large, interconnected colonies that can span multiple locations, making it challenging to control.\n\nEcologically, Monomorium pharaonis is an opportunistic and adaptable species, thriving in a wide range of environments, including residential and commercial buildings, hospitals, and food processing facilities. They are primarily scavengers, feeding on a variety of foods, including sugary substances, proteins, and fats. Their ability to live in close association with humans, their high reproductive rate, and their adaptability to various environments contribute to their status as a persistent and problematic pest species in many parts of the world.",
