  "description": "Montipora capricornis is a species of stony coral belonging to the family Acroporidae. It is commonly known as the horned Montipora or the capricorn coral.\n\nMontipora capricornis is a colonial, hermatypic (reef-building) coral that typically forms encrusting or nodular growth forms. The colony surface is covered with numerous, small, horn-like protrusions, which give the species its distinctive appearance. These protrusions can vary in size and density across different colonies.\n\nThe coral polyps of Montipora capricornis are small, usually measuring less than 2 millimeters in diameter. The polyps are embedded within the calcareous skeleton and extend their tentacles to capture plankton and other suspended particles from the surrounding water column.\n\nMontipora capricornis is typically found in shallow, tropical marine environments, such as fringing reefs, lagoons, and sheltered reef slopes. It is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the central Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis species plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of coral reef ecosystems, contributing to the overall biodiversity and structural complexity of these vital marine habitats.",
