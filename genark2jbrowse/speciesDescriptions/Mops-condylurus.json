  "description": "Mops condylurus, commonly known as the African house bat or the Angolan house bat, is a species of bat that belongs to the family Molossidae, also known as the free-tailed bats. This species is found in various parts of Africa, including Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe African house bat is a medium-sized bat, with a body length ranging from 9 to 11 centimeters and a wingspan of approximately 30 to 35 centimeters. It has a distinctive rounded head, large ears, and a broad, rounded muzzle. The fur on its back is dark brown to blackish in color, while the belly is paler, ranging from grayish to brownish-gray.\n\nThese bats are known for their ability to roost in close proximity to human habitats, often found in buildings, attics, and other man-made structures. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of flying insects, including moths, beetles, and mosquitoes.\n\nMops condylurus plays an important ecological role in controlling insect populations and is considered beneficial to humans in urban and agricultural areas. However, their close association with human habitats can sometimes lead to conflicts, and they may be perceived as pests in some situations.\n\nOverall, the African house bat is an adaptable and widely distributed species that has successfully integrated into various human-modified environments across its range in Africa.",
