  "description": "Mumps orthorubulavirus is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, which are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. The Mumps orthorubulavirus, also known as the Mumps virus, is the causative agent of the viral disease called mumps.\n\nThe virus particle is approximately 150-200 nanometers in diameter and has a spherical shape. The viral genome consists of a single, linear, negative-sense RNA molecule that encodes seven structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large (L) proteins.\n\nThe virus primarily infects and replicates within the epithelial cells of the salivary glands, leading to the characteristic swelling of the parotid glands, a common symptom of mumps. The virus can also spread to other tissues, such as the pancreas, testes, and central nervous system, causing additional complications.\n\nMumps orthorubulavirus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets or saliva from infected individuals, or indirectly through contaminated surfaces. The virus is known to cause outbreaks, particularly in settings with close personal contact, such as schools, colleges, and military barracks.\n\nVaccination with the mumps vaccine, typically in combination with the measles and rubella vaccines (MMR), is the primary means of prevention and control for the Mumps orthorubulavirus infection.",
