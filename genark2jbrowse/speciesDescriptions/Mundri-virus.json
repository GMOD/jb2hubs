  "description": "Mundri virus is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus, which belongs to the family Nairoviridae. Nairovirus is a group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses primarily transmitted by ticks. The Mundri virus was first isolated in 1969 from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks collected in Mundri, South Sudan.\n\nMundri virus is classified as a Biosafety Level 3 pathogen due to its potential to cause severe disease in humans. The virus is known to infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including livestock and wild animals. In humans, Mundri virus infection can lead to a febrile illness with symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, the exact clinical manifestations and epidemiology of Mundri virus infection in humans are not well-characterized due to the limited number of reported cases.\n\nThe genome of Mundri virus consists of three segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, which encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein, glycoprotein precursor (GPC), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that Mundri virus is closely related to other members of the Orthonairovirus genus, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, highlighting the need for further research and surveillance to better understand the epidemiology and public health significance of this virus.",
