  "description": "Muntiacus reevesi, commonly known as the Reeves's muntjac or the Chinese muntjac, is a small species of deer native to southeastern China and Taiwan. It belongs to the genus Muntiacus, which includes several species of small deer known as muntjacs.\n\nReeves's muntjacs are small in size, typically standing around 50 cm (20 inches) tall at the shoulder and weighing between 10-20 kg (22-44 pounds). They have a distinctive appearance, with short, antler-like ossicones (a type of horn) on the males and a reddish-brown coat that can vary in shade. Their facial features include a prominent white throat patch and preorbital glands near the eyes.\n\nThese deer are primarily solitary and nocturnal, inhabiting dense forests, scrublands, and areas with abundant vegetation cover. They are adept at navigating through the understory and are known for their agile movements. Reeves's muntjacs are herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including leaves, shoots, fruits, and sometimes fungi.\n\nPopulations of Reeves's muntjacs have been relatively stable, and the species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, they face threats from habitat loss, hunting, and competition with other introduced deer species in some regions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and adaptable species.",
