  "description": "Mus musculus domesticus, also known as the house mouse, is a subspecies of the common mouse (Mus musculus) that has been domesticated and adapted to live in close association with humans. This small rodent belongs to the family Muridae and is one of the most widely distributed and well-studied mammals on Earth.\n\nThe house mouse is a small, slender animal with a pointed snout, large ears, and a long, scaly tail. Its fur is typically grayish-brown in color, with a lighter underbelly. They are highly adaptable and can thrive in a wide range of habitats, including homes, farms, and urban environments.\n\nMus musculus domesticus is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a variety of plant and animal materials, including grains, seeds, insects, and even human food scraps. They are known for their high reproductive rate, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year, each containing up to 12 offspring.\n\nDue to their close association with humans, house mice are considered a significant pest species, as they can cause damage to property, contaminate food sources, and potentially spread diseases. However, they are also an important model organism in biomedical research, contributing to our understanding of genetics, behavior, and disease processes.",
