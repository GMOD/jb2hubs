  "description": "Mus musculus molossinus is a subspecies of the house mouse (Mus musculus), which is a small rodent species widely distributed across the world. The Mus musculus molossinus subspecies is specifically found in Japan, including the main islands of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, as well as some smaller surrounding islands.\n\nMus musculus molossinus is characterized by its relatively larger size compared to other house mouse subspecies, with a head-body length typically ranging from 80 to 105 millimeters. It has a greyish-brown to reddish-brown coat color and a slightly shorter tail compared to the body length. The skull and dental features of Mus musculus molossinus also exhibit distinct morphological characteristics that differentiate it from other house mouse subspecies found in other regions.\n\nThis subspecies has adapted to various habitats in Japan, including urban areas, agricultural lands, and forested environments. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a prey species for various predators and as a potential agricultural pest. Mus musculus molossinus has also been widely used in scientific research, particularly in the fields of genetics and biomedical studies, due to its genetic and physiological similarities to other house mouse subspecies.",
