This species is native to the Iberian Peninsula, primarily found in Spain and Portugal.\n\nMus spretus is a relatively small mouse, with an average body length of around 8-10 cm and a weight of approximately 12-20 grams. The species has a grayish-brown fur coat on its dorsal (upper) side and a lighter, almost white, ventral (lower) side. The ears and tail are also covered with short fur.\n\nMus spretus is a nocturnal and terrestrial species, typically inhabiting a variety of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and agricultural areas. It is known to be an opportunistic feeder, with a diet that includes seeds, grains, fruits, and small invertebrates.\n\nThe reproductive biology of Mus spretus is characterized by a relatively short gestation period of around 19-21 days, with females typically giving birth to litters of 4-8 young. The species is known to have a relatively high reproductive rate, with the potential to produce multiple litters per year.\n\nMus spretus is considered a pest species in some agricultural regions due to its potential to cause damage to crops and stored grains. However, it also plays an important role in the ecosystem as a prey species for various predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores.",
