  "description": "Mya arenaria, commonly known as the softshell clam or steamer clam, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Myidae.\n\nMya arenaria is a filter-feeding clam that lives buried in the sediment of tidal flats and estuaries. It has a thin, elongated shell that can grow up to 15 cm in length. The shell is grayish-white in color and the siphon, which extends from the shell, can be up to 30 cm long.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with native populations found on the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe, as well as introduced populations in the Pacific Northwest of North America and the western Pacific. Mya arenaria plays an important role in the ecology of coastal ecosystems, serving as a food source for various predators and helping to maintain healthy sediment conditions through its burrowing and feeding activities.\n\nCommercially, Mya arenaria is an important seafood species, harvested for human consumption in many regions. Its meat is considered a delicacy and is often prepared by steaming or frying.",
