  "description": "Mycena indigotica is a species of fungi belonging to the genus Mycena, which is a large and diverse group of small, delicate mushrooms commonly known as \"Bonnet Mushrooms.\" This species is characterized by its distinctive indigo-blue coloration, which is the result of the presence of pigments called indigoids in the mushroom's tissues.\n\nMycena indigotica is typically found growing on decaying wood, such as fallen logs or stumps, in temperate and tropical forests. The cap of the mushroom is convex or bell-shaped, ranging from 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter, and the stem is slender and fragile, often reaching up to 10 centimeters in length.\n\nThe spore print of Mycena indigotica is white, and the spores themselves are elliptical in shape. The species is known to exhibit bioluminescence, with the cap and stem emitting a faint, ghostly glow in the dark, a phenomenon often referred to as \"foxfire.\"\n\nMycena indigotica is considered a saprotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients by breaking down and decomposing organic matter in its environment. This ecological role makes it an important contributor to the cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems.",
