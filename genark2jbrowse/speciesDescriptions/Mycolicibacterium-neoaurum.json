  "description": "Mycolicibacterium neoaurum is a species of actinobacteria that belongs to the genus Mycolicibacterium. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nMycolicibacterium neoaurum is characterized by the presence of mycolic acids in its cell wall, a feature that is common among members of the Mycolicibacterium genus. These mycolic acids contribute to the waxy and hydrophobic nature of the cell surface, which can aid in the bacterium's survival in various environments.\n\nThe cells of M. neoaurum are typically rod-shaped and can form filamentous structures. They are capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, typically between 20°C and 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 37°C.\n\nMetabolically, M. neoaurum is known for its ability to degrade and utilize a variety of organic compounds, including steroids and xenobiotics. This metabolic versatility has led to the species being studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biotransformation processes.\n\nOverall, Mycolicibacterium neoaurum is a versatile actinobacterial species that has been the subject of research due to its unique physiological and metabolic characteristics.",
