  "description": "Myotis myotis, commonly known as the greater mouse-eared bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. It is one of the largest species of bats in Europe, with a wingspan that can reach up to 40 cm (16 inches).\n\nThe greater mouse-eared bat has a robust, stocky body, with a large head and prominent ears. Its fur is typically a greyish-brown color, with a lighter underside. The species is well-adapted to a variety of habitats, including forests, urban areas, and caves, where they form large colonies during the breeding season.\n\nThese bats are insectivorous, feeding primarily on moths, beetles, and other flying insects. They use their echolocation abilities to locate and capture their prey in flight. The greater mouse-eared bat is known for its long lifespan, with some individuals living up to 30 years in the wild.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, and is considered to be of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, some populations have experienced declines due to factors such as habitat loss, disturbance of roosting sites, and the use of pesticides.",
