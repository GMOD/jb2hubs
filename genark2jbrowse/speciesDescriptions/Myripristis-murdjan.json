  "description": "Myripristis murdjan, commonly known as the pinecone soldierfish or Bigeye soldierfish, is a species of soldierfish belonging to the family Holocentridae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, inhabiting coral reefs and rocky areas at depths ranging from 1 to 40 meters.\n\nThe Myripristis murdjan is a small, laterally compressed fish with a large, rounded head and prominent eyes. Its body is covered with large, spiny scales, giving it a distinctive pinecone-like appearance. The fish typically displays a reddish-orange coloration, with darker bands or spots along its sides. It has a large mouth with small, pointed teeth used for feeding on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other small marine organisms.\n\nThis species is known to form large, dense schools during the day, often taking shelter in crevices or overhangs on the reef. At night, they become more solitary and actively forage for food. Myripristis murdjan plays an important ecological role in coral reef ecosystems, contributing to the overall diversity and functioning of these complex marine environments.",
