  "description": "Myxoma virus is a member of the Leporipoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a large, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects rabbits and hares. The virus is the causative agent of myxomatosis, a severe and often fatal disease in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).\n\nThe Myxoma virus genome is approximately 160 kilobase pairs in size and encodes around 150 genes. The virus replicates within the cytoplasm of infected host cells, using the cellular machinery to produce new viral particles. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or through arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes and fleas.\n\nInfection with the Myxoma virus leads to the development of characteristic skin lesions, known as myxomas, as well as severe respiratory distress, fever, and suppression of the host's immune system. The disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly through rabbit populations, often resulting in high mortality rates.\n\nMyxoma virus is of significant interest in the field of evolutionary biology, as it has been used as a model system to study host-pathogen interactions and the co-evolution of viruses and their hosts. The virus has also been investigated for its potential use in targeted cancer therapy, as it has the ability to selectively infect and kill certain types of tumor cells.",
