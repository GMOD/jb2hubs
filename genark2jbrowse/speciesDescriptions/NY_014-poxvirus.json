  "description": "The NY_014 poxvirus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. Poxviruses are large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses known for their complex replication cycle and ability to infect a wide range of host species, including humans and other vertebrates.\n\nThe NY_014 poxvirus is a novel strain that was first identified in New York, USA. It is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes well-known pathogens such as the variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) and the vaccinia virus (used in the smallpox vaccine).\n\nGenomic analysis of the NY_014 poxvirus has revealed that it is genetically distinct from other known Orthopoxviruses, suggesting that it may represent a new species or a divergent strain within the genus. Further research is needed to fully characterize its epidemiology, host range, and potential pathogenicity in human and animal populations.\n\nIt is important to note that the identification and study of novel poxviruses is crucial for understanding the evolution and diversity of this medically significant virus family, as well as for developing effective prevention and control strategies.",
