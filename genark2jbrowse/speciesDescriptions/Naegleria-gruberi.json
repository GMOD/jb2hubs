  "description": "Naegleria gruberi is a free-living amoeboflagellate protozoan that belongs to the genus Naegleria, within the phylum Percolozoa. It is a unicellular eukaryotic organism that can exist in three different forms: a trophozoite (feeding and dividing stage), a flagellate (motile stage), and a cyst (dormant stage).\n\nThe trophozoite form of N. gruberi is typically between 10-25 micrometers in size and exhibits an amoeboid movement, using pseudopodia to locomote and capture prey. The flagellate form has two flagella that allow the organism to swim and disperse. The cyst form is a resistant stage that can withstand unfavorable environmental conditions, such as desiccation or lack of nutrients.\n\nN. gruberi is commonly found in soil, freshwater environments, and even some human-made water sources. It is a ubiquitous organism and is considered non-pathogenic to humans, although its close relative, Naegleria fowleri, can cause a rare and severe infection called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in humans.\n\nNaegleria gruberi is an important model organism for the study of cellular and molecular biology, particularly in areas such as cell motility, signal transduction, and the evolution of eukaryotic cells.",
