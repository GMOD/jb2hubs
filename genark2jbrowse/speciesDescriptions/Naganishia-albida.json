  "description": "Naganishia albida is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a white-colored, spherical to ellipsoidal yeast that reproduces asexually through budding. Naganishia albida is found in various natural environments, including soil, water, and the surfaces of plants. This species is known to be psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow and survive at low temperatures, making it adaptable to colder climates. Naganishia albida has been reported to produce extracellular polysaccharides, which may have potential applications in the food or pharmaceutical industries. The genome of this species has been sequenced, providing insights into its evolutionary relationships and metabolic capabilities.",
