  "description": "Nannochloropsis gaditana CCMP526 is a species of unicellular marine microalgae belonging to the phylum Ochrophyta, class Eustigmatophyceae. It is a small, spherical or ovoid-shaped microalgae, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 micrometers in diameter.\n\nNannochloropsis gaditana CCMP526 is a photosynthetic organism, capable of converting carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy-rich compounds, such as lipids and carbohydrates, through the process of photosynthesis. It is known to be a prolific producer of valuable omega-3 fatty acids, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which makes it a promising candidate for biofuel and nutraceutical applications.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from the CÃ¡diz Bay in Spain, and the CCMP526 strain is maintained in the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA) culture collection. Nannochloropsis gaditana CCMP526 is considered a robust and versatile microalgae, capable of growing in a wide range of environmental conditions, including varying temperature, salinity, and nutrient levels.",
