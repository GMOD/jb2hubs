  "description": "Nannochloropsis oculata CCMP525 is a single-celled marine microalgae species that belongs to the phylum Ochrophyta, class Eustigmatophyceae. It is a photosynthetic organism commonly found in coastal and open ocean environments.\n\nNannochloropsis oculata CCMP525 is a small, spherical or ovoid-shaped cell, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 micrometers (Î¼m) in diameter. It has a distinctive greenish-brown color due to the presence of various pigments, including chlorophyll, carotenoids, and xanthophylls.\n\nThis microalgae species is known for its ability to accumulate high levels of valuable lipids, particularly omega-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which makes it a commercially important organism for biofuel production and nutritional supplements.\n\nNannochloropsis oculata CCMP525 is capable of rapid growth and can thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions, including varying temperatures, salinity levels, and nutrient availability. It is commonly used in aquaculture and biotechnology applications due to its versatility and potential for industrial-scale production.",
