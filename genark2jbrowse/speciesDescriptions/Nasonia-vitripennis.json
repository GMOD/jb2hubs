  "description": "Nasonia vitripennis, commonly known as the Jewel Wasp, is a small parasitoid wasp species that belongs to the family Pteromalidae. This insect is widely used as a model organism in various areas of biological research, including evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, and developmental genetics.\n\nNasonia vitripennis is a haplodiploid species, meaning that males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, while females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid. The wasp has a body length of approximately 2-3 millimeters and a distinctive metallic green or blue-green coloration.\n\nThe Jewel Wasp is known for its unique reproductive behavior, where the female wasp lays its eggs inside the pupae of various fly species, including blowflies and house flies. The wasp larvae then develop inside the host, consuming the host's tissues and ultimately emerging as adult wasps.\n\nNasonia vitripennis has been extensively studied for its rapid development, genetic tractability, and complex behavioral repertoire, making it a valuable model organism for understanding various biological processes, such as host-parasite interactions, sex determination, and the evolution of social behaviors.",
