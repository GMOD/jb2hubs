  "description": "Natator depressus, commonly known as the flatback sea turtle, is a species of marine turtle found in the tropical waters of northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is one of the smallest species of sea turtle, with an average carapace (upper shell) length of around 90 cm.\n\nThe flatback sea turtle has a distinctive flattened and rounded carapace, which is typically olive-green or grey in color. Its head is relatively small compared to its body size, and its front flippers are broad and paddle-like, adapted for swimming in the ocean.\n\nThese turtles are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of seagrasses and algae. They play an important role in the marine ecosystem, maintaining the health of seagrass beds and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region.\n\nFlatback sea turtles are listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with threats including habitat loss, bycatch in fishing operations, and the collection of eggs for human consumption. Conservation efforts, such as protected nesting sites and public awareness campaigns, are essential for the continued survival of this unique and fascinating species.",
