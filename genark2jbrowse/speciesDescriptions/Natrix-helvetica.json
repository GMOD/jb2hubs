  "description": "Natrix helvetica, commonly known as the Grass Snake or Barred Grass Snake, is a non-venomous snake species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the genus Natrix, which is a group of water snakes found throughout Europe and western Asia.\n\nThe Grass Snake is a medium-sized snake, typically reaching lengths between 50-80 cm. It has a slender, cylindrical body with a relatively small head. The coloration of the Grass Snake is variable, ranging from olive-green to brown, with black or dark brown bars or spots along the body. The underside is typically yellowish or whitish.\n\nNatrix helvetica is semi-aquatic, preferring habitats near ponds, streams, and marshes, where it can find its primary prey, which includes amphibians such as frogs and newts. The snake is an excellent swimmer and often basks on the banks of water bodies.\n\nLike other Natrix species, the Grass Snake is oviparous, meaning it reproduces by laying eggs. The females typically lay between 10-30 eggs in damp, sheltered locations, such as under logs or in compost heaps, where the eggs can incubate and hatch.\n\nNatrix helvetica is a harmless species and poses no threat to humans. It is often found in areas with suitable habitat and is considered a valuable part of the ecosystem, contributing to the control of amphibian populations.",
