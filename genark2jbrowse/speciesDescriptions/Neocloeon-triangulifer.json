  "description": "Neocloeon triangulifer is a species of mayfly that belongs to the order Ephemeroptera. Mayflies are small, delicate insects known for their short adult lifespan, typically only a few days.\n\nNeocloeon triangulifer is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped hind wings, which are a key identifying feature of this species. The adults typically have a body length of around 6-8 millimeters and possess three tails or cerci. Their coloration is generally pale or grayish, with some darker markings or patterns on the wings and body.\n\nThese mayflies are found in freshwater habitats, such as rivers, streams, and lakes, throughout North America. They play an important role in aquatic food webs, serving as prey for various predators, including fish, birds, and other invertebrates. Their presence is often used as an indicator of water quality, as they are sensitive to environmental changes and pollution.\n\nThe life cycle of Neocloeon triangulifer follows the typical mayfly pattern, with aquatic nymphal stages and a brief adult stage focused on reproduction before they die. The nymphs undergo a series of molts as they grow and develop, eventually emerging as winged adults to mate and continue the cycle.",
