  "description": "Neodiprion fabricii is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Diprionidae. These insects are small, typically measuring around 8-12 millimeters in length. They have a distinctive sawlike ovipositor that females use to lay their eggs within the needles of coniferous trees, particularly pine species.\n\nN. fabricii is found in various parts of North America, where it can be considered a pest species as its larvae, known as \"pine sawfly larvae,\" can defoliate and damage pine trees. The larvae have a green or yellowish-green coloration with distinct black or dark stripes running along their bodies.\n\nThese sawflies undergo a complete metamorphosis, with distinct egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larvae feed on the pine needles, while the adults are free-living and do not cause significant damage to the host plants. N. fabricii plays a role in the forest ecosystem as part of the natural cycle of conifer growth and regeneration, but can also cause economic concerns for forestry and landscaping industries when populations reach outbreak levels.",
