  "description": "Neospora caninum is an intracellular protozoan parasite that primarily infects dogs and cattle. It is a member of the Apicomplexa phylum, closely related to the well-known Toxoplasma gondii.\n\nThe life cycle of N. caninum involves both definitive (dogs) and intermediate (cattle, sheep, and other mammals) hosts. In the definitive host, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction, resulting in the production of oocysts that are shed in the host's feces. Intermediate hosts become infected by ingesting these oocysts or through transplacental transmission from the dam to the fetus during pregnancy.\n\nWithin the intermediate host, N. caninum undergoes asexual multiplication, forming tachyzoites and tissue cysts. Tachyzoites are the rapidly dividing, acute stage of the parasite, which can cause severe disease in the host. Tissue cysts, on the other hand, are the chronic stage, allowing the parasite to persist within the host's tissues.\n\nNeosporosis, the disease caused by N. caninum, is a significant cause of abortion and reproductive losses in cattle and other livestock. It can also cause neurological disorders and mortality in dogs. Effective control measures involve the prevention of oocyst ingestion, as well as the identification and culling of infected animals from breeding herds.",
