  "description": "Neovahlkampfia damariscottae is a species of free-living amoeba that belongs to the genus Neovahlkampfia, which is part of the group Heterolobosea. It was first isolated from water samples collected in the Damariscotta River estuary in Maine, United States.\n\nNeovahlkampfia damariscottae is a small, uninucleate amoeba that exhibits a characteristic locomotive form with a single, elongated, and often pointed pseudopodium. The amoeba's cytoplasm is typically clear, with visible contractile vacuoles for osmoregulation. It reproduces asexually through binary fission, forming two daughter cells.\n\nPhylogenetically, Neovahlkampfia damariscottae is closely related to other members of the Neovahlkampfia genus, which are known to inhabit various aquatic environments, including freshwater, marine, and brackish water ecosystems. The species is believed to play a role in the microbial food web and may contribute to the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the environments where it is found.",
