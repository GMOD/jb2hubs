  "description": "Nestor notabilis, commonly known as the Kea, is a large parrot species endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. It is the world's only alpine parrot, found in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps.\n\nThe Kea is characterized by its distinctive olive-green plumage, with reddish-orange patches on its wings and tail. It has a large, hooked beak adapted for tearing and manipulating objects, and it is known for its remarkable intelligence and curiosity, often exhibiting problem-solving abilities and tool use.\n\nKeas are highly social birds, living in family groups and engaging in complex social interactions. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, insects, and even carrion. Their diet and behavior have led to their reputation as intelligent and adaptable birds, capable of thriving in the harsh alpine environment.\n\nDespite their adaptability, the Kea population has faced various threats, including habitat loss, introduced predators, and human-wildlife conflicts. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and fascinating species, which holds an important place in the ecological and cultural heritage of New Zealand.",
