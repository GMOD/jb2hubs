  "description": "Nicotiana tabacum, commonly known as tobacco, is a plant species belonging to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is an annual, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 2 meters tall. The leaves of N. tabacum are large, oblong-shaped, and can reach up to 60 cm in length. The flowers are tubular, ranging in color from white to pink or purple, and are arranged in clusters at the top of the plant.\n\nN. tabacum is an important commercial crop, primarily cultivated for the production of tobacco products, such as cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco. The leaves of the plant contain high concentrations of nicotine, a stimulant and addictive substance, which is the primary active ingredient in tobacco products. The plant is native to the Americas and has been cultivated for centuries, with its use and cultivation spreading globally over time.\n\nGenetically, N. tabacum is an allotetraploid, meaning it has four sets of chromosomes, two of which were derived from different parent species within the Nicotiana genus. This genetic makeup contributes to the plant's diverse and adaptable characteristics, enabling it to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions.",
