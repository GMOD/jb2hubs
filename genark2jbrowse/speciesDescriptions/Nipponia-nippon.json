  "description": "Nipponia nippon, commonly known as the Japanese crested ibis or toki, is a critically endangered species of ibis native to East Asia. It is the only ibis species found in Japan and is considered a national treasure of the country.\n\nThe Japanese crested ibis is a medium-sized wading bird, measuring around 60-70 cm in length. It has a distinctive white plumage with black wing tips, a long, curved beak, and a crest of feathers on its head. The species is known for its unique vocalizations, which include a loud, honking call.\n\nHistorically, the Japanese crested ibis was widely distributed throughout Japan, China, and the Korean Peninsula. However, due to factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and the use of pesticides, the species experienced a dramatic population decline in the 20th century, and by the 1980s, it was believed to be extinct in the wild.\n\nConservation efforts, including captive breeding and reintroduction programs, have helped to gradually restore the wild population of the Japanese crested ibis. Today, the species is found in a few protected areas in Japan and China, with ongoing efforts to ensure its long-term survival.\n\nThe Japanese crested ibis plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a top predator of various aquatic organisms and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its native habitats. Its conservation remains a priority for environmental and wildlife authorities in the region.",
