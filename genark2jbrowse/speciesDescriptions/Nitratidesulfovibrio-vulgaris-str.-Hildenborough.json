  "description": "Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough is a species of anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria that belongs to the phylum Deltaproteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, motile, curved-rod shaped bacterium known for its ability to couple the oxidation of organic compounds with the reduction of nitrate and sulfate.\n\nThis strain, Hildenborough, was originally isolated from freshwater sediments and is a model organism for the study of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris is capable of utilizing a variety of organic substrates, such as lactate, pyruvate, and hydrogen, as electron donors for the reduction of nitrate and sulfate to nitrite, nitrous oxide, sulfite, and sulfide.\n\nThe genome of Nitratidesulfovibrio vulgaris str. Hildenborough has been sequenced, providing insights into the metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms that enable this bacterium to thrive in anoxic environments. This species plays a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen and sulfur in various natural and engineered ecosystems.",
