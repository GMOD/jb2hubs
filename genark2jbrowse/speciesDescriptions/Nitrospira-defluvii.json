  "description": "Nitrospira defluvii is a species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that belongs to the phylum Nitrospirae. It is a key player in the nitrogen cycle, responsible for the oxidation of nitrite (NO2-) to nitrate (NO3-) in a process known as nitrite oxidation.\n\nNitrospira defluvii is a small, gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It is an obligate aerobe, meaning it requires oxygen to survive and grow. The cells are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species is chemolithoautotrophic, which means it derives its energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, specifically nitrite, and uses carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source for cellular growth and metabolism. Nitrospira defluvii is considered a specialist in nitrite oxidation, as it is highly efficient in this process compared to other nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.\n\nNitrospira defluvii is found in a variety of natural and engineered environments, including soil, freshwater, and wastewater treatment systems, where it plays a crucial role in the removal of nitrogen compounds and the maintenance of a balanced nitrogen cycle.",
