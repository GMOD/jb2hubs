  "description": "Norovirus dog/GVI.1/HKU_Ca026F/2007/HKG is a strain of canine norovirus that was first identified in 2007 in Hong Kong. Noroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Caliciviridae family.\n\nThis specific strain of canine norovirus, Norovirus dog/GVI.1/HKU_Ca026F/2007/HKG, was isolated from a dog in Hong Kong in 2007. Genetic analysis has shown that this strain belongs to the GVI.1 genogroup of canine noroviruses, which is distinct from the genogroups that primarily infect humans.\n\nNoroviruses are known to infect a variety of mammalian hosts, including humans, and can cause acute gastroenteritis. The host range and zoonotic potential of this specific canine norovirus strain are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health implications of this canine norovirus strain.",
