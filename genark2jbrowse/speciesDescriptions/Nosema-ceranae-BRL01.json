  "description": "Nosema ceranae BRL01 is a microsporidian parasite that infects the honey bee (Apis species). It is a single-celled, obligate intracellular organism that belongs to the phylum Microsporidia.\n\nNosema ceranae BRL01 is a strain or isolate of the species Nosema ceranae, which was first identified in the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) and later found to infect the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) as well. This particular strain, BRL01, was isolated from honey bees in Brazil.\n\nNosema ceranae is known to cause nosemosis, a disease that can have negative impacts on the health and longevity of honey bee colonies. The parasite infects the epithelial cells of the bee's midgut, disrupting nutrient absorption and leading to reduced fitness and lifespan of the affected bees.\n\nOngoing research focuses on understanding the biology, epidemiology, and potential management strategies for Nosema ceranae infections in honey bee populations, given the potential implications for commercial and wild bee populations.",
