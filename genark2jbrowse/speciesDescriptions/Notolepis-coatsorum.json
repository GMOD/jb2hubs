  "description": "Notolepis coatsorum is a species of deep-sea fish belonging to the order Salmoniformes. It is commonly known as the Coats' notolepis or Coats' barracudina. \n\nNotolepis coatsorum is a small, elongated fish with a streamlined body and a large mouth filled with sharp teeth. It typically grows to a maximum length of around 30 centimeters. The fish has a distinctive coloration, with a dark blue or greenish-black back and silvery-white underside, which helps camouflage it in the deep-sea environment.\n\nThis species is found in the North Atlantic Ocean, primarily in the waters around Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, at depths ranging from 400 to 1,500 meters. Notolepis coatsorum is a predatory fish, feeding on smaller fishes and crustaceans.\n\nThe species was first described scientifically in 1961 and is named after the Coats brothers, who were prominent Arctic explorers and researchers. Notolepis coatsorum is considered a rare and understudied deep-sea fish, with limited information available about its biology, ecology, and population status.",
