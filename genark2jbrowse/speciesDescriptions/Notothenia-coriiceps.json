  "description": "Notothenia coriiceps, commonly known as the Antarctic rockcod or black rockcod, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Nototheniidae. It is native to the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica.\n\nNotothenia coriiceps is a benthic, demersal fish, meaning it lives and feeds near the seafloor. It can grow up to around 50 centimeters in length and has a distinctive dark brown or black coloration with a mottled or reticulated pattern, which provides camouflage in its rocky and kelp-dominated habitat.\n\nThis species is well-adapted to the cold, Antarctic environment. It has antifreeze proteins in its blood that allow it to survive the sub-zero temperatures of the Southern Ocean. Notothenia coriiceps is an important component of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, serving as a predator of various invertebrates and smaller fish.\n\nAs a commercially valuable species, Notothenia coriiceps is harvested for human consumption, particularly in the coastal regions of Antarctica and surrounding islands. However, its populations are managed to ensure sustainable fishing practices.",
