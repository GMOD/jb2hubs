  "description": "Numenius arquata, commonly known as the Eurasian curlew, is a large wading bird species belonging to the family Scolopacidae. It is a migratory species found across parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa.\n\nThe Eurasian curlew is characterized by its long, curved bill, which it uses to probe the soil and mud for invertebrate prey such as crustaceans, mollusks, and insects. It has a distinctive brown plumage with a pale underside and a long, slender neck.\n\nThe species breeds in open, grassy habitats, such as moorlands, bogs, and coastal marshes, where it builds a simple nest on the ground. It is known for its haunting, evocative call, which has been described as a \"curloo\" or \"cur-lee\" sound.\n\nEurasian curlews are important indicators of the health of their ecosystem, as they are sensitive to changes in habitat quality and availability. Their population numbers have declined in recent decades due to factors such as habitat loss, disturbance, and hunting pressure, leading to conservation concerns for the species.",
