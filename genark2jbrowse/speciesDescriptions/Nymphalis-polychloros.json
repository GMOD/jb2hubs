  "description": "Nymphalis polychloros, commonly known as the Large Tortoiseshell, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 60-80 millimeters.\n\nThe upper side of the wings is predominantly orange-brown with dark brown or black markings, giving it a distinctive tortoiseshell pattern. The hindwings have a row of blue spots near the outer edge. The underside of the wings is mottled brown, providing camouflage when the butterfly is at rest.\n\nNymphalis polychloros is found in various habitats, including deciduous forests, parks, and gardens, across Europe and parts of Asia. The larvae, or caterpillars, feed primarily on the leaves of elm, willow, and poplar trees.\n\nThe butterfly undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. During the winter, the adults may hibernate, often in groups, and emerge in the early spring to mate and lay their eggs on the host plants.\n\nNymphalis polychloros is known for its distinctive appearance and is a valued member of the diverse butterfly communities found in its natural range.",
