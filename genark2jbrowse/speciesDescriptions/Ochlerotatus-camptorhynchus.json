  "description": "Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus is a species of mosquito belonging to the genus Ochlerotatus. It is commonly known as the Southern Saltmarsh Mosquito or the Coastal Saltmarsh Mosquito.\n\nOchlerotatus camptorhynchus is a medium-sized mosquito, with a body length typically ranging from 4 to 6 millimeters. It has a distinctive curved proboscis (mouthpart) that gives it the specific epithet \"camptorhynchus,\" which means \"curved snout\" in Greek.\n\nThe adult mosquitoes have a dark brown or black coloration, with pale scales on the legs and abdomen. The wings are clear with dark veins. Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus is primarily found in coastal saltmarsh habitats, where it breeds in the brackish or saline waters that accumulate in these environments.\n\nThis species is known to be an aggressive biter, often targeting humans and other mammals. Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus is an important vector of various arboviral diseases, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE), which can be transmitted to humans and animals through its bites.\n\nThe larvae of Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus are adapted to live in the unique saltmarsh habitat, with the ability to tolerate high salinity levels. They feed on algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms present in the water.\n\nOchlerotatus camptorhynchus is widely distributed along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, ranging from New Jersey to Texas, and is considered a significant pest and public health concern in these regions.",
