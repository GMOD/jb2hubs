  "description": "Odobenus rosmarus divergens, commonly known as the Pacific walrus, is a subspecies of the walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) that inhabits the northern Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. The Pacific walrus is a large, marine mammal characterized by its distinctive long tusks, which can reach up to 1 meter in length. These tusks are used for a variety of purposes, including defense, social interactions, and assistance in hauling out onto ice floes or land.\n\nThe Pacific walrus has a robust, barrel-shaped body with a thick layer of blubber that helps insulate it from the cold Arctic environment. It has a broad, rounded head and a large, whiskered muzzle. The species is known for its characteristic behavior of gathering in large herds, often hundreds or thousands of individuals, on ice floes or coastal haul-out sites.\n\nPacific walruses primarily feed on bivalve mollusks, such as clams and mussels, which they locate and extract from the seafloor using their sensitive whiskers and powerful jaws. They are an important component of the Arctic marine ecosystem, serving as a key prey species for predators like polar bears and orcas.\n\nThe Pacific walrus population is considered vulnerable due to various threats, including climate change, which has led to a reduction in sea ice and changes in their habitat and food availability. Conservation efforts are focused on monitoring and protecting this iconic Arctic species.",
