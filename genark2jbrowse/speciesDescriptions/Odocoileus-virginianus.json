  "description": "Odocoileus virginianus, commonly known as the white-tailed deer, is a medium-sized deer species native to the eastern and central regions of North America. This herbivorous mammal belongs to the order Artiodactyla and the family Cervidae.\n\nThe white-tailed deer is characterized by its distinctive white-colored underside and tail, which it often raises and flashes as a warning signal to other deer. The species is well-adapted to a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and suburban areas, and can thrive in both rural and urban environments.\n\nWhite-tailed deer are typically solitary or found in small groups, and they are known for their keen senses of smell, hearing, and vision, which help them detect predators and navigate their environment. They are browsers, feeding on a wide range of vegetation, including leaves, twigs, and agricultural crops.\n\nReproduction in white-tailed deer is seasonal, with breeding occurring in the fall and fawns being born in the spring. The species is an important part of many ecosystems and is a popular game animal, providing food and recreational opportunities for human populations.",
