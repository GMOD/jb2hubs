It is native to the temperate waters of eastern South America, particularly in the RÃ­o de la Plata estuary and the coastal regions of Argentina and Uruguay.\n\nThe Argentinian silverside is a small, slender fish with a silvery-white coloration along its sides and belly. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 30 centimeters (12 inches). This species is an important commercial and recreational fish, and it is also widely used as a baitfish.\n\nOdontesthes bonariensis is a schooling fish that inhabits both marine and brackish environments, such as estuaries, lagoons, and coastal waters. It primarily feeds on small crustaceans, plankton, and other small invertebrates. The species is known for its ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, including fluctuations in temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels.\n\nOdontesthes bonariensis plays a significant role in the aquatic ecosystems of its native range, serving as an important food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife. Its ecological importance and commercial value have made it a subject of various conservation and management efforts in the region.",
