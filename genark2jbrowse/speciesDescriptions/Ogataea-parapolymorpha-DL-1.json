  "description": "Ogataea parapolymorpha DL-1 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Ogataea. It is a haploid, single-celled eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nThe cells of Ogataea parapolymorpha DL-1 are typically oval or ellipsoidal in shape, with a size range of approximately 3-6 Î¼m in diameter. This species is known to be able to utilize a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, methanol, and certain other organic compounds, for its energy and growth requirements.\n\nOgataea parapolymorpha DL-1 has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, particularly in the production of heterologous proteins and the development of methanol-based fermentation processes. It is considered a promising model organism for the study of methylotrophic yeast physiology and metabolism.",
