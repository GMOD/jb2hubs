  "description": "Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi, commonly known as the Westslope cutthroat trout, is a subspecies of the cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) native to the upper Missouri River basin in the northwestern United States.\n\nWestslope cutthroat trout are typically silver-colored with dark spots on their backs and sides, and a distinctive reddish-orange slash beneath their jaw, which gives them their \"cutthroat\" name. They have 9-14 gill rakers and 110-170 scales along the lateral line. These trout are generally smaller in size compared to other cutthroat subspecies, typically reaching lengths of 8-16 inches (20-40 cm).\n\nThe Westslope cutthroat is adapted to the cold, clear waters of the Rocky Mountain region, where it occupies streams, rivers, and lakes. It is an important component of the native trout fauna in this area and is prized by anglers for its fighting ability and table quality. Due to habitat loss and hybridization with non-native trout species, the Westslope cutthroat has experienced significant population declines across its native range, leading to conservation efforts to protect this unique subspecies.",
