  "description": "Oncorhynchus keta, commonly known as the chum salmon or dog salmon, is a species of anadromous Pacific salmon. It is one of the six species of the genus Oncorhynchus, which are native to the northern Pacific Ocean and adjacent areas.\n\nChum salmon are distinguished by their large size, with adults typically ranging from 16 to 31 inches in length and weighing between 7 and 15 pounds. They have a distinctive hump that develops on their back during the spawning season, as well as a hooked jaw and pronounced teeth.\n\nThe life cycle of chum salmon begins in freshwater streams and rivers, where they spawn and their eggs hatch. After hatching, the young salmon, known as fry, migrate downstream to the ocean, where they spend several years maturing before returning to their natal streams to spawn and complete the cycle.\n\nChum salmon are an important commercial and subsistence fishery species, and their populations are closely monitored and managed by fisheries agencies. They are found in coastal regions of the North Pacific, from Japan and the Korean Peninsula to Alaska and the Pacific Northwest of North America.",
