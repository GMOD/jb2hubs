  "description": "Oncorhynchus kisutch, commonly known as the coho salmon or silver salmon, is a species of anadromous fish that belongs to the Pacific salmon genus Oncorhynchus. It is native to the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent rivers in Asia and North America.\n\nCoho salmon are medium-sized fish, typically weighing between 3 to 12 pounds (1.4 to 5.4 kg) and reaching lengths of 16 to 31 inches (41 to 79 cm). They have a distinctive silvery-blue coloration on their back and upper sides, with a white or silvery belly. During spawning, the males develop a distinctive hooked jaw and develop intense red and green hues.\n\nCoho salmon spend the first part of their life cycle in freshwater streams and rivers, where they hatch from eggs and undergo their early development. After 1 to 2 years in freshwater, they migrate to the ocean, where they grow and mature. After 1 to 4 years in the ocean, the adult coho salmon return to their natal streams to spawn, completing their anadromous life cycle.\n\nCoho salmon are an important commercial and recreational fishery species, and they also play a vital role in the ecosystems of the North Pacific, serving as a food source for various predators, including bears, eagles, and humans. Conservation efforts are in place to manage and protect coho salmon populations, which can be threatened by factors such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and climate change.",
