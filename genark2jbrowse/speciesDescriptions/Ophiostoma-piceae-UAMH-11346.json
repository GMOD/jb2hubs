  "description": "Ophiostoma piceae is a filamentous fungus species that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is commonly known as the blue-stain fungus due to the characteristic blue-gray discoloration it can cause on the wood of coniferous trees, particularly spruce (Picea spp.).\n\nThe UAMH 11346 strain is a specific isolate of Ophiostoma piceae that has been deposited in the University of Alberta Microfungus Collection and Herbarium (UAMH). This strain was likely obtained from a wood or bark sample and has been maintained in culture for research purposes.\n\nOphiostoma piceae is a saprobic fungus, meaning it can decompose and utilize the dead or dying plant material as a source of nutrients. It is often associated with bark beetles and other wood-boring insects, which can facilitate the dispersal and infection of the fungus in tree hosts.\n\nThe fungus produces dark-colored, flask-shaped reproductive structures called perithecia, which contain ascospores for sexual reproduction. Asexual spores, known as conidia, are also produced and can contribute to the spread of the fungus.\n\nOphiostoma piceae is considered an important forest pathogen due to its ability to cause economic damage by discoloring and degrading the wood quality of infected trees. Understanding the biology and ecology of this species, as well as the UAMH 11346 strain, can provide insights into its role in forest ecosystems and potential management strategies.",
