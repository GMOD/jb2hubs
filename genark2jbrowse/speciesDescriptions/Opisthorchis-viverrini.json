  "description": "Opisthorchis viverrini is a species of liver fluke, a type of parasitic flatworm that infects the biliary system of humans and other mammals. It is a trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae.\n\nThe adult O. viverrini flukes measure approximately 5-10 mm in length and reside in the bile ducts of the infected host. They feed on the bile and can cause various hepatobiliary diseases, including cholangitis, cholelithiasis, and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer).\n\nThe life cycle of O. viverrini involves freshwater snails as the first intermediate host and several species of freshwater fish as the second intermediate host. Humans and other mammals become infected by consuming raw or undercooked fish that harbor the metacercariae (infective larval stage) of the parasite.\n\nO. viverrini is primarily endemic to certain regions of Southeast Asia, particularly northeastern Thailand, central Laos, and southern Vietnam, where the consumption of traditional dishes containing raw or fermented fish is a common cultural practice. Infection with this liver fluke is a significant public health concern in these areas due to its association with the development of bile duct cancer.",
