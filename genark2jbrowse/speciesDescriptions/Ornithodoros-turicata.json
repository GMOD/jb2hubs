  "description": "Ornithodoros turicata is a species of soft tick belonging to the family Argasidae. It is commonly known as the Turicata tick or the Tampico tick. This tick species is found in parts of North America, primarily in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\nOrnithodoros turicata is a small, flattened tick that can range in color from grayish-white to dark brown. They have a rounded, oval-shaped body and lack the distinct dorsal shield (scutum) found in hard ticks. These ticks are known to feed on a variety of hosts, including rodents, rabbits, livestock, and occasionally humans.\n\nThe life cycle of O. turicata involves multiple stages, including egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ticks in this species can live for several years and may go through multiple feeding cycles during their lifespan. They are capable of surviving long periods without a host and can remain dormant for extended periods.\n\nOrnithodoros turicata is of medical importance as it can transmit the bacterium Borrelia turicatae, which causes a disease known as tick-borne relapsing fever. This disease can cause recurrent fever, headaches, and other symptoms in infected individuals. Proper identification and management of O. turicata populations are essential to mitigate the risk of disease transmission.",
