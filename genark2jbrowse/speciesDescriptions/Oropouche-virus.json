  "description": "Oropouche virus (OROV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus within the family Peribunyaviridae. It is primarily transmitted by the biting midge Culicoides paraensis and can infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe virus genome consists of three segments (small, medium, and large) that encode various structural and non-structural proteins essential for viral replication and assembly. OROV is known to cause Oropouche fever, an acute febrile illness characterized by symptoms such as headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash in humans.\n\nOropouche virus is primarily found in South America, particularly in Brazil, and has been responsible for several outbreaks in the region. The virus can be transmitted between humans through close contact or mosquito vectors, posing a significant public health concern in areas where it is endemic.\n\nResearch on OROV has focused on understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential development of effective vaccines or antiviral therapies to mitigate the impact of Oropouche fever outbreaks.",
