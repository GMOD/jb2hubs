  "description": "Orthobunyavirus bwambaense is a species of virus belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus.\n\nOrthobunyavirus bwambaense was first isolated from mosquitoes collected in the Bwamba region of Uganda in the 1940s. It is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes and has been found to infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, although the clinical significance of human infections is not well-characterized.\n\nThe genome of Orthobunyavirus bwambaense consists of three segments of RNA, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The virus particles are spherical in shape and range in size from 80 to 120 nanometers in diameter.\n\nOrthobunyavirus bwambaense is classified as a member of the Bunyamwera serogroup within the Orthobunyavirus genus, which includes several other medically important viruses known to cause various febrile illnesses in humans and animals.",
