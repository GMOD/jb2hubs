  "description": "Orthohantavirus andesense is a species of hantavirus that is primarily found in South America. It is a member of the genus Orthohantavirus, which is a group of zoonotic viruses that are primarily transmitted by rodents.\n\nOrthohantavirus andesense is known to be carried by the Andes field mouse (Abrothrix andinus), a small rodent species native to the Andes mountains of Argentina and Chile. The virus can be transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents, or by inhaling aerosolized virus particles.\n\nInfection with Orthohantavirus andesense can lead to Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), a severe and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness. Symptoms of HPS typically include fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and eventually, the development of fluid buildup in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory distress and cardiovascular complications.\n\nOngoing research is aimed at better understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and clinical manifestations of Orthohantavirus andesense, as well as developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for this emerging infectious disease.",
