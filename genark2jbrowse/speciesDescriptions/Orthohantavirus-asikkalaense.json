  "description": "Orthohantavirus asikkalaense is a species of hantavirus that was first identified in Finland. Hantaviruses are a group of zoonotic viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents or their excreta. \n\nOrthohantavirus asikkalaense is a member of the Orthohantavirus genus, which includes several virus species known to cause serious human diseases such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HAPS).\n\nThe virus was isolated from bank voles (Myodes glareolus) collected in the Asikkala region of Finland. Genetic analysis has shown that Orthohantavirus asikkalaense is genetically distinct from other known hantavirus species, suggesting it may represent a unique strain or variant found in the local rodent population.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully characterize the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential human health impacts associated with Orthohantavirus asikkalaense. Ongoing surveillance and study of this newly identified hantavirus strain can provide valuable insights into the diversity and zoonotic potential of these important viral pathogens.",
