  "description": "Orthohantavirus bayoui is a species of hantavirus, a type of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects rodents. Orthohantavirus bayoui is found in North America and is associated with the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) as its primary reservoir host.\n\nThe virus is transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents, typically by inhalation of aerosolized virus particles. Infection with Orthohantavirus bayoui can lead to a serious respiratory illness known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath, often progressing to life-threatening respiratory distress.\n\nGenetic analysis has shown that Orthohantavirus bayoui is closely related to other North American hantavirus species, such as Sin Nombre virus and Black Creek Canal virus, but it is distinct and has its own unique genetic and antigenic properties. Continued research on Orthohantavirus bayoui and other hantaviruses is important for understanding their epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures.",
