  "description": "Orthohantavirus dobravaense is a species of hantavirus that was first identified in the Dobrava region of Slovenia. Hantaviruses are a group of RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents.\n\nOrthohantavirus dobravaense is primarily associated with the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) as its primary natural reservoir host. Infection with this virus can cause Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in humans, which is characterized by fever, headache, back and abdominal pain, nausea, blurred vision, hypotension, and acute kidney injury.\n\nThe virus is believed to be transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosolized virus particles from contaminated rodent nests or environments. Serological studies have indicated that Orthohantavirus dobravaense is found in parts of Central and Eastern Europe, primarily in regions where the yellow-necked mouse is present.\n\nFurther research is still needed to fully understand the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and clinical manifestations associated with Orthohantavirus dobravaense infections in humans.",
