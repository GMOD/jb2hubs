  "description": "Orthohantavirus hantanense is a species of hantavirus, a group of rodent-borne viruses that belong to the family Hantaviridae. Hantaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents, their urine, feces, or saliva.\n\nOrthohantavirus hantanense was first identified in the Hantaan River valley in South Korea, where it was discovered to be the causative agent of a severe form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterized by fever, hemorrhage, and kidney dysfunction.\n\nThe virus is carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), a common rodent species found in East Asia. Infection in humans typically occurs through inhalation of virus-contaminated dust or direct contact with infected rodents or their excreta.\n\nOrthohantavirus hantanense is considered a significant public health concern in regions where it is endemic, as it can cause severe and potentially life-threatening illness in humans. Effective prevention and control measures, such as rodent control and proper hygiene practices, are crucial in reducing the risk of transmission to humans.",
