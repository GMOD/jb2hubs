  "description": "Orthohantavirus prospectense is a species of hantavirus, a type of virus that belongs to the family Hantaviridae. Hantaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents, their excreta, or their saliva.\n\nOrthohantavirus prospectense is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects certain species of rodents, such as voles and mice, in specific geographic regions. The virus can cause serious respiratory illnesses in humans, known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPRS) or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), which can be life-threatening.\n\nThe genome of Orthohantavirus prospectense consists of three segments, encoding the viral proteins necessary for its replication and assembly. These proteins include the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).\n\nOngoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential for clinical manifestations associated with Orthohantavirus prospectense infections, as well as to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies for individuals who may be exposed to this virus.",
