  "description": "Orthohantavirus robinaense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the family Hantaviridae. Hantaviruses are primarily carried by rodents and are known to cause serious infectious diseases in humans, such as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) and Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS).\n\nOrthohantavirus robinaense was first identified in the robin (Erithacus rubecula), a small songbird native to Europe and western Asia. This particular species of hantavirus is believed to have a limited host range, primarily infecting robins and potentially other closely related avian species. However, the full extent of its host distribution and potential transmission to humans is still under investigation.\n\nGenetically, Orthohantavirus robinaense is distinct from the more well-known hantavirus species that are typically associated with rodent reservoirs and cause significant human disease. The discovery of this avian-borne hantavirus highlights the diversity of these viruses and the importance of continued surveillance and research to understand their ecology, evolution, and potential public health implications.",
