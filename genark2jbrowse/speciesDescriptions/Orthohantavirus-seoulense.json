  "description": "Orthohantavirus seoulense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is a member of the Hantaviridae family. Hantaviruses are primarily rodent-borne viruses that can cause serious diseases in humans, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HAPS).\n\nOrthohantavirus seoulense is specifically associated with the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) as its primary natural host. The virus is transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents, or by inhaling aerosolized viral particles.\n\nThe genome of Orthohantavirus seoulense consists of three single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments, which encode the viral nucleocapsid protein, the glycoprotein precursor, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The virus primarily targets the endothelial cells of the host, leading to increased vascular permeability and the potential development of HFRS in humans.\n\nOrthohantavirus seoulense is found primarily in East Asia, particularly in countries such as South Korea, where it was first identified and isolated from infected rodents. Monitoring and surveillance of rodent populations, as well as public health education about the risks of exposure, are important measures for managing and controlling the spread of this virus.",
