  "description": "Orthohantavirus tatenalense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the family Hantaviridae. This virus was first isolated from rodents in the Tatena region of Peru.\n\nOrthohantavirus tatenalense is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. It is primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents, particularly certain species of mice and voles. \n\nThe virus can cause a disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, which is characterized by fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and, in severe cases, fluid buildup in the lungs leading to breathing difficulties. Infection with Orthohantavirus tatenalense can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.\n\nResearch on this virus is ongoing to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential treatments or preventive measures. Maintaining good hygiene and avoiding contact with rodents in endemic areas are crucial for reducing the risk of Orthohantavirus tatenalense infection in humans.",
