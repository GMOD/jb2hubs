  "description": "Orthohantavirus tulaense is a species of hantavirus that was first identified in the Tulare County, California, United States. It is a member of the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the Hantaviridae family.\n\nOrthohantavirus tulaense is a zoonotic virus, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. The primary reservoir host for this virus is believed to be the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus), a small rodent species found in the western United States.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the inhalation of aerosolized viral particles from the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents. Exposure can also occur through direct contact with infected animals or their nesting materials.\n\nInfection with Orthohantavirus tulaense can lead to a disease known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in humans, which is characterized by fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and, in severe cases, fluid buildup in the lungs. HPS can be a life-threatening condition, and prompt medical attention is crucial for effective treatment and management.\n\nOngoing research is focused on understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health implications of this hantavirus species within its geographic range.",
