  "description": "Orthonairovirus dugbeense is a virus species belonging to the genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae. Nairoviridae is a family of single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA viruses.\n\nOrthonairovirus dugbeense was first isolated from ticks (Amblyomma variegatum) collected in Nigeria, Africa. It is primarily transmitted by ticks and can infect various animal hosts, including humans, causing a disease known as Dugbe virus disease.\n\nThe genome of Orthonairovirus dugbeense consists of three segments of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. These segments encode the structural proteins of the virus, including the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), respectively.\n\nOrthonairovirus dugbeense is classified as a member of the Dugbe virus species within the genus Orthonairovirus. It is closely related to other Orthonairovirus species, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is known to cause severe disease in humans.",
