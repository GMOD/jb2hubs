  "description": "Orthonairovirus tomdiense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae. Nairoviridae is a family of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted by ticks.\n\nOrthonairovirus tomdiense is named after the location where it was first discovered, which is the Tom Di region in South Africa. It is a member of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus serogroup within the Orthonairovirus genus.\n\nThe Orthonairovirus tomdiense virus is primarily found in ticks and can be transmitted to humans through tick bites, contact with infected animals, or exposure to contaminated environments. Infection with this virus can cause severe illness, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a potentially life-threatening viral disease characterized by fever, headache, and internal and external bleeding.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of Orthonairovirus tomdiense infections.",
