  "description": "Oryza sativa, commonly known as Asian rice or simply rice, is a species of cereal grain that is the most widely cultivated and consumed staple food in the world. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is the primary food source for more than half of the global population.\n\nOryza sativa is an annual, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant that typically grows to a height of 0.5 to 1.8 meters. The plant has a hollow, jointed stem and long, narrow leaves. It produces panicles (branched clusters) of small, edible grains called rice, which are the seed of the plant.\n\nThe rice grain is composed of several layers, including the outer hull (or husk), the bran layer, and the starchy endosperm, which is the edible part of the grain. Rice is categorized into different varieties based on factors such as grain size, shape, and amylose content, which affect its cooking and eating characteristics.\n\nOryza sativa is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions and is cultivated in various regions around the world, from tropical to temperate climates. It is a key component of many cultural and culinary traditions and is a major source of calories, proteins, and other essential nutrients in the human diet.",
