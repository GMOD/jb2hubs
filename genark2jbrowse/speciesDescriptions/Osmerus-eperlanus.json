  "description": "Osmerus eperlanus, commonly known as the European smelt or sparling, is a small anadromous fish species that belongs to the family Osmeridae. It is found in coastal and estuarine waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, from the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe European smelt is a slender, elongated fish with a greenish-blue back and silvery sides. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 20 cm. The species is known for its distinctive smelt-like odor, which is often described as resembling the scent of freshly cut cucumbers.\n\nOsmerus eperlanus is an important commercial and recreational fish species, valued for its delicate flavor and small size, which makes it popular for frying or smoking. The species undertakes seasonal migrations, moving from the sea to freshwater rivers and estuaries to spawn, usually in early spring. The eggs are adhesive and are attached to substrates such as rocks, plants, or gravel.\n\nThe European smelt plays a significant role in the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and marine mammals. It is also an important indicator species, as its presence and abundance can provide insights into the overall health and productivity of the coastal and estuarine environments it occupies.",
