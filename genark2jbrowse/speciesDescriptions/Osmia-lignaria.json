  "description": "Osmia lignaria, commonly known as the blue orchard bee or the mason bee, is a species of solitary bee native to North America. It is a member of the genus Osmia, which is part of the family Megachilidae, also known as the leafcutter bees.\n\nOsmia lignaria is a small to medium-sized bee, typically measuring between 10-12 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive metallic blue-green or blue-black coloration on its body, which helps distinguish it from other bee species. The females have enlarged, spoon-shaped mandibles that they use to collect and manipulate mud and plant materials for nest construction.\n\nThese bees are important pollinators, particularly for fruit trees and other early-blooming plants. They are solitary, meaning each female constructs and provisions her own nest, typically in pre-existing cavities such as abandoned beetle burrows or hollow plant stems. The females will gather pollen and nectar to provision their nest cells, which they seal with a mud or leaf-based partition, before laying an egg in each cell.\n\nOsmia lignaria is considered a valuable alternative to honey bees for crop pollination, as they are highly efficient and effective pollinators, especially for tree fruits and berries. Their early-season activity and adaptability to various nesting sites make them a valuable asset in agricultural and horticultural settings.",
