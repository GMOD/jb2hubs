  "description": "Ostreococcus tauri is a species of unicellular green algae belonging to the Prasinophyceae class. It is considered one of the smallest known free-living eukaryotic organisms, with a cell size typically ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 micrometers in diameter.\n\nOstreococcus tauri is a marine phytoplankton species found in coastal and oceanic environments worldwide. It is a photosynthetic organism, capable of converting light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This tiny algae plays a significant role in marine ecosystems, contributing to the primary productivity of the oceans.\n\nThe genome of Ostreococcus tauri is one of the smallest known among eukaryotes, with a size of approximately 12.6 megabases. This compact genome reflects the species' adaptation to its small cell size and the challenges associated with maintaining a larger genome. Ostreococcus tauri has been extensively studied as a model organism in various fields, including cell biology, evolutionary genomics, and marine ecology.",
