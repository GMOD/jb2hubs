  "description": "Ostrinia nubilalis, commonly known as the European corn borer, is a species of moth in the family Crambidae. It is a major agricultural pest that primarily feeds on corn (maize) plants, as well as other crops such as sorghum, millet, and certain vegetables.\n\nThe European corn borer is a small, nocturnal moth with a wingspan of approximately 25-35 millimeters. The adults have grayish-brown wings with distinctive dark spots or bands. The larvae are off-white to pinkish-brown in color, with a dark head and prothoracic shield.\n\nThe life cycle of the European corn borer involves multiple generations per year, with the exact number varying by region. The larvae overwinter within the stems or stalks of host plants, emerging in the spring to feed on the leaves, tassels, and developing ears of the corn plant. This feeding can result in significant yield losses and plant damage.\n\nThe species is native to Europe and Asia, but has been introduced to North America, where it has become a major agricultural pest. Effective management strategies for the European corn borer often involve the use of insecticides, crop rotation, and the adoption of genetically modified corn varieties that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins, which provide resistance against the pest.",
