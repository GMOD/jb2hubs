It is a nocturnal and arboreal mammal native to parts of East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.\n\nOtolemur garnettii is a small-sized primate, with a body length ranging from 25 to 35 cm and a weight between 400 to 900 grams. It has large, round eyes, large ears, and a long, bushy tail that is used for balance and communication. The fur coloration varies from grayish-brown to reddish-brown, and it has a distinct white or cream-colored belly.\n\nThese primates are known for their agile and acrobatic movements, leaping and climbing through the trees with ease. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, small vertebrates, and fruits. Otolemur garnettii is a social species, living in small family groups and communicating through a range of vocalizations, including high-pitched calls and soft grunts.\n\nOtolemur garnettii is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats. However, habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities, such as deforestation and urbanization, can pose challenges to the species' long-term survival.",
