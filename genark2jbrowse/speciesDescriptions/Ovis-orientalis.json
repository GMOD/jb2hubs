  "description": "Ovis orientalis, commonly known as the Asiatic mouflon or the wild sheep, is a species of wild sheep native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. This species is considered the wild ancestor of the domestic sheep (Ovis aries).\n\nThe Asiatic mouflon is a medium-sized ungulate, with a shoulder height typically ranging from 70 to 90 centimeters (28 to 35 inches). They have a stocky build, with short, muscular legs and a thick, woolly coat that can vary in color from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, with white underparts and a distinctive dark dorsal stripe.\n\nThe species is known for its impressive, spiral-shaped horns, which can grow up to 80 centimeters (31 inches) in length in the males. These horns are a distinctive feature and are used for both display and defense.\n\nOvis orientalis is a social animal, living in small herds of up to 20 individuals, led by a dominant female. They are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, and shrubs found in their mountainous habitat.\n\nThe Asiatic mouflon is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, with populations declining due to factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and competition with domestic livestock. Conservation efforts are in place to protect this iconic wild sheep species and its fragile mountain ecosystems.",
