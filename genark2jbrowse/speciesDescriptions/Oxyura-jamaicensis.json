  "description": "Oxyura jamaicensis, commonly known as the ruddy duck, is a species of stiff-tailed duck native to North America. It belongs to the genus Oxyura, which is a group of diving ducks characterized by their distinctive stiff tails.\n\nThe ruddy duck is a small to medium-sized waterfowl, typically measuring between 35-43 cm in length and weighing around 400-800 grams. The male birds exhibit a distinctive breeding plumage, with a bright blue bill, a chestnut-colored body, and a white cheek patch. The females and non-breeding males have a more muted brown or grayish coloration.\n\nThese ducks are excellent divers and feed primarily on aquatic vegetation, insects, and small crustaceans. They are found in a variety of freshwater habitats, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes, where they spend much of their time on the water surface or diving below to forage.\n\nOxyura jamaicensis is known for its unique courtship displays, which involve the male inflating his chest, raising his stiff tail, and emitting a distinctive whistling call. These behaviors are believed to play a crucial role in pair formation and mating within the species.\n\nThe ruddy duck is widely distributed across North America, with breeding populations found in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. It is a migratory species, with some populations undertaking seasonal movements between breeding and wintering grounds.",
