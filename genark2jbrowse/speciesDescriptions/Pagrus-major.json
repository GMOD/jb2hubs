  "description": "Pagrus major, commonly known as the red seabream or Japanese red seabream, is a species of marine teleost fish belonging to the family Sparidae. It is native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, found along the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China.\n\nPagrus major is a relatively large fish, with adults typically reaching lengths of 30-60 cm. The body is deep and laterally compressed, with a large, slightly protruding mouth and small, rounded teeth adapted for crushing hard-shelled prey. The coloration is distinctive, with a bright red or pinkish-red dorsal surface that fades to a silvery-white ventral region.\n\nThis species is an important commercial and recreational target in its native range, valued for its delicious flesh and high market demand. Pagrus major is a demersal fish, inhabiting coastal waters and reef environments, where it feeds primarily on mollusks, crustaceans, and small fishes. It is a protandrous hermaphrodite, meaning it begins life as a male and later transitions to a female during its lifespan.\n\nConservation efforts and fishery management practices are crucial for the sustainable exploitation of Pagrus major, as overexploitation and habitat degradation can pose threats to the species' populations in certain regions.",
