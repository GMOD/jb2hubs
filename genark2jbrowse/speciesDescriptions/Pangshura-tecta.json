  "description": "Pangshura tecta, commonly known as the Indian tent turtle or Indian roofed turtle, is a freshwater turtle species native to the Indian subcontinent. This species belongs to the family Geoemydidae and is known for its distinctive shell shape.\n\nThe carapace (upper shell) of the Indian tent turtle is high and arched, resembling the shape of a tent, hence the common name. The carapace is typically olive-brown or dark brown in color, with some individuals exhibiting a pattern of radiating yellow or orange lines. The plastron (lower shell) is typically yellow or cream-colored.\n\nThese turtles are relatively small, with an average carapace length of around 15-20 centimeters. They are primarily aquatic, inhabiting various freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, insects, small fish, and crustaceans.\n\nThe Indian tent turtle is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, pollution, and collection for the pet trade. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique turtle species and its fragile ecosystem in the Indian subcontinent.",
