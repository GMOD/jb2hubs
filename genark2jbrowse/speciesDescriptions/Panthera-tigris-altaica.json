  "description": "Panthera tigris altaica, commonly known as the Siberian tiger or Amur tiger, is a subspecies of the tiger (Panthera tigris) found in the Sikhote-Alin mountain region of the Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk Krai provinces in the Russian Far East.\n\nThe Siberian tiger is the largest living cat species, with adult males weighing up to 300 kg (660 lb) and measuring up to 3.5 m (11 ft) in total length. It has a thick, luxurious coat that is orange-red with dark brown or black stripes, which provides insulation against the harsh, cold climate of its habitat.\n\nAdaptations to the Siberian tiger's environment include its ability to tolerate low temperatures, its large size and body mass for efficient heat retention, and its powerful limbs and jaws for hunting large prey such as red deer, wild boar, and Manchurian wapiti. The Siberian tiger is an apex predator and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of its forested habitat.\n\nDue to historic hunting and habitat loss, the Siberian tiger is classified as an Endangered species, with an estimated population of around 500 individuals in the wild. Conservation efforts, such as anti-poaching patrols and habitat preservation, have helped to stabilize and even increase the population in recent years.",
