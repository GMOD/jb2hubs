  "description": "Pantholops hodgsonii, commonly known as the Tibetan antelope or chiru, is a species of antelope native to the Tibetan Plateau of Central Asia. It is the only extant member of the genus Pantholops.\n\nThe Tibetan antelope is a medium-sized, slender-bodied antelope with distinctive curved horns. It has a reddish-brown coat that turns whiter in the winter. The species is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of the Tibetan Plateau, with its ability to thrive in the cold, dry, and oxygen-depleted conditions.\n\nPantholops hodgsonii is a social animal, living in herds and migrating seasonally in search of grazing areas. It is an herbivore, feeding primarily on grasses and sedges. The species is classified as \"Vulnerable\" by the IUCN due to historical and ongoing threats from hunting and habitat loss.\n\nConservation efforts, including antipoaching patrols and the establishment of protected areas, have helped stabilize the Tibetan antelope population in recent years. However, the species continues to face challenges in maintaining its numbers and distribution across the Tibetan Plateau.",
