  "description": "Papilio polytes, commonly known as the common mormon, is a species of swallowtail butterfly found in Asia. It belongs to the genus Papilio, which is the largest genus of true butterflies.\n\nThe common mormon is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of around 8-12 centimeters. The upper side of its wings is typically black, with distinct white or cream-colored markings. The hindwings have a series of red spots near the outer margin. The underside of the wings is more muted in color, with a pattern of gray, brown, and white.\n\nThis species is known for its remarkable polymorphism, with females exhibiting multiple distinct color forms, including a mimic form that resembles the unpalatable Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly. This remarkable adaptation helps the common mormon avoid predation by birds and other predators.\n\nThe common mormon's lifecycle includes the egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult stages. The caterpillars feed on various plants in the family Rutaceae, such as citrus trees and the commonly known curry leaf plant.\n\nPapilio polytes is widely distributed across Asia, ranging from India and Sri Lanka to China and Japan. It is a common and widely-studied species that has contributed to our understanding of evolutionary processes, such as Batesian mimicry and the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in natural populations.",
