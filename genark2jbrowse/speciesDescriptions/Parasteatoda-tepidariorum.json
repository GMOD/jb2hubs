  "description": "Parasteatoda tepidariorum, commonly known as the common house spider or cellar spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Theridiidae. It is a small, round-bodied spider, typically measuring between 3-8 millimeters in length.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across the world, found in various habitats, including human-made structures such as homes, barns, and cellars. It is known for its ability to build its web in dark, sheltered areas, often in the corners of rooms or under furniture.\n\nParasteatoda tepidariorum is a sedentary spider, waiting patiently in the center of its web to capture prey, which typically consists of small insects and other arthropods that become entangled in the sticky silk. It uses its venom to immobilize its prey before consuming it.\n\nThe species is generally considered harmless to humans, as its venom is not potent enough to cause significant harm. It plays a role in the ecosystem by helping to control populations of smaller insects and arthropods in the areas it inhabits.",
