  "description": "Parechovirus A is a species of virus belonging to the genus Parechovirus, which is part of the family Picornaviridae. Parechovirus A viruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nThe genome of Parechovirus A consists of approximately 7.3 kilobases and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural and non-structural viral proteins. These proteins are essential for viral replication and particle assembly.\n\nParechovirus A is primarily associated with human infections, particularly in young children. It can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and occasionally more severe conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis. The virus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route and can also be spread through respiratory secretions.\n\nParechovirus A is an important pathogen in pediatric populations, and ongoing research aims to better understand its epidemiology, clinical impact, and potential interventions for prevention and treatment.",
