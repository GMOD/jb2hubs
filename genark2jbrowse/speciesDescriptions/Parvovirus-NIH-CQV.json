  "description": "Parvovirus NIH-CQV is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Parvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. The virus was first discovered in 2016 during a viral metagenomics study conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States.\n\nThe genome of Parvovirus NIH-CQV is approximately 5 kilobases in length and encodes two major proteins: the non-structural protein (NS1) and the structural capsid protein (VP). The virus is believed to have a narrow host range, primarily infecting certain species of mammals, though its exact host specificity and potential for cross-species transmission are still under investigation.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Parvovirus NIH-CQV is genetically distinct from other known parvoviruses, suggesting it represents a novel viral species. Further research is needed to fully characterize its biological properties, epidemiology, and potential impact on host organisms.",
