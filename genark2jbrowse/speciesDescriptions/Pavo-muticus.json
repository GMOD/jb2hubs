  "description": "Pavo muticus, commonly known as the green peafowl, is a species of peafowl native to southeastern Asia. It is one of the three extant species of peafowl, belonging to the genus Pavo.\n\nThe green peafowl is a large, ornamental bird known for its striking appearance. The male, often referred to as the peacock, has a long, iridescent green tail that can be fanned out in a spectacular display, while the female, known as the peahen, has a more subdued brown and green plumage.\n\nPhysically, the green peafowl is characterized by its long, slender neck, a crest of feathers on its head, and its powerful, sharp-clawed feet. The bird's diet consists mainly of insects, small reptiles, and various plant materials.\n\nHabitat-wise, the green peafowl prefers forested areas, including deciduous and evergreen forests, as well as scrublands and grasslands. Its native range includes parts of Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, southern China, and Indonesia.\n\nDue to habitat loss and hunting, the green peafowl is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic and visually stunning member of the Pavo genus.",
