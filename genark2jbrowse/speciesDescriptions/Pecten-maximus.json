  "description": "Pecten maximus, commonly known as the great scallop or king scallop, is a species of marine bivalve mollusk in the family Pectinidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, from Norway to the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe great scallop has a distinctive fan-shaped shell, with two unequal valves. The upper valve is typically a vibrant reddish-orange color, while the lower valve is usually white or pale in color. The shell can grow up to 20 centimeters in diameter, making it one of the largest species of scallops.\n\nPecten maximus is a filter-feeding organism, using its gills to extract plankton and other suspended particles from the water column. It is known for its ability to rapidly open and close its shell, a behavior that allows it to swim short distances by expelling water from the mantle cavity.\n\nThe great scallop is an important commercial species, valued for its edible adductor muscle, which is the part of the animal that is typically consumed. It is commercially fished and farmed in various regions of Europe, and is considered a delicacy in many cuisines.",
