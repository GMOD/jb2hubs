  "description": "Pediculus humanus corporis, commonly known as the body louse, is a small, wingless insect that infests the human body. It belongs to the order Phthiraptera, a group of parasitic insects that live on the skin and hair of mammals and birds.\n\nThe body louse is a close relative of the head louse (Pediculus humanus capitis), but it prefers to inhabit the clothing and bedding of its human host, rather than the scalp. These lice feed on human blood and can transmit several serious diseases, including epidemic typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.\n\nPhysically, the body louse is approximately 2-4 millimeters in length, with a flattened, elongated body and six well-developed legs. They have small, piercing mouthparts that they use to feed on their host's blood. The body louse undergoes a simple metamorphosis, with three nymphal stages before reaching adulthood.\n\nInfestation with body lice is often associated with poor hygiene, overcrowded living conditions, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Effective control measures include improved sanitation, regular washing of clothing and bedding, and the use of insecticidal treatments when necessary.",
