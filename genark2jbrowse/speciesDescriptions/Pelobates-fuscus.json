  "description": "Pelobates fuscus, commonly known as the common spadefoot toad, is a species of amphibian belonging to the family Pelobatidae. It is found in various parts of Europe, including Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe common spadefoot toad is a medium-sized, stocky toad with a distinctive spade-like structure on its hind feet, which it uses for burrowing into the soil. Its skin is generally dull brown or grayish-brown in color, with darker blotches or warts. The eyes of the Pelobates fuscus are prominent and have vertical, cat-like pupils.\n\nThese toads are nocturnal and spend the majority of their time underground, emerging mainly during the breeding season to mate and lay eggs in temporary water bodies, such as ponds or puddles. Their diet consists of a variety of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and small vertebrates.\n\nPelobates fuscus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, and its burrowing behavior helps it conserve moisture and avoid predators. The species is considered vulnerable in some parts of its range due to habitat loss and fragmentation, but it remains relatively widespread and abundant in certain regions.",
