  "description": "Pelodytes ibericus, also known as the Iberian parsley frog, is a species of frog native to the Iberian Peninsula, primarily found in Portugal and Spain. It belongs to the family Pelodytidae, which includes a small group of unique frog species.\n\nThe Iberian parsley frog is a small-sized amphibian, typically measuring between 3 to 5 centimeters in length. It has a slender, elongated body with long hind limbs adapted for jumping. The skin is rough and warty, with a coloration that ranges from various shades of brown to gray, often with darker markings or spots. The species derives its common name from the parsley-like pattern on its back, which helps it camouflage in its natural habitat.\n\nPelodytes ibericus is primarily a terrestrial species, inhabiting damp and humid environments, such as meadows, forests, and scrublands. It is nocturnal and often found near water sources, where it breeds. The species reproduces through the deposition of eggs in temporary water bodies, and the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis to transform into fully developed frogs.\n\nThe Iberian parsley frog is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but its populations may be threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to factors such as urbanization, agriculture, and climate change.",
