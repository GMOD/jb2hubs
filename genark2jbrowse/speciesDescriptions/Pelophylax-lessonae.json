  "description": "Pelophylax lessonae, also known as the pool frog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Ranidae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, with a distribution ranging from France to Russia.\n\nPelophylax lessonae is a medium-sized frog, typically measuring between 5-8 cm in length. It has a slender, elongated body with a pointed snout and long, slender limbs. The skin is smooth and can vary in color from olive-green to brown, with darker spots or patches. The hind legs are long and muscular, adapted for jumping and swimming in the aquatic habitats it prefers.\n\nThis species is typically found in permanent and semi-permanent water bodies, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It is a versatile amphibian, capable of both terrestrial and aquatic locomotion. Pelophylax lessonae is primarily carnivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and other arthropods.\n\nReproduction in Pelophylax lessonae typically occurs during the spring and early summer months. Males engage in vocal displays to attract females, and mating takes place in the water. Females lay clusters of eggs, which hatch into aquatic tadpoles that eventually undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs.\n\nPelophylax lessonae is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is generally adaptable to a range of habitats. However, it may face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and introduced predatory species in some regions.",
