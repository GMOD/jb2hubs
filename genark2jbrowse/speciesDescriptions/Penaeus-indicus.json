  "description": "Penaeus indicus, commonly known as the Indian white prawn or white shrimp, is a species of marine crustacean belonging to the family Penaeidae. It is a commercially important species found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Indian white prawn is a medium-sized shrimp, typically reaching a length of around 15-20 centimeters (6-8 inches). It has a slender, elongated body with a distinctive rostrum (pointed beak-like structure on the head) that extends beyond the eyes. The body is generally white or light pink in color, with a slightly translucent appearance.\n\nPenaeus indicus is a benthic species, meaning it lives and feeds on the seafloor. It is found in shallow coastal waters, estuaries, and mangrove habitats, where it feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, algae, and detritus.\n\nThe species is an important target for commercial fisheries, particularly in countries such as India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It is widely consumed as a food source and is also used in aquaculture for its high nutritional value and rapid growth rate.\n\nPenaeus indicus plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystem, serving as a food source for larger predators and contributing to the overall productivity and biodiversity of the coastal environments it inhabits.",
