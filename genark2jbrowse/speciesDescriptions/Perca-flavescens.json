  "description": "Perca flavescens, commonly known as the yellow perch, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Percidae. It is native to the eastern and central regions of North America, found in lakes, rivers, and streams across Canada and the United States.\n\nThe yellow perch is a medium-sized fish, typically ranging from 15 to 30 cm in length. It has a distinctive yellow-green coloration with dark vertical bars along its sides, which help it blend in with its aquatic environment. The body is laterally compressed, and the fish has two separate dorsal fins, the first with spiny rays and the second with soft rays.\n\nYellow perch are opportunistic predators, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including zooplankton, aquatic insects, small crustaceans, and even small fish. They play an important role in the ecosystem, both as a prey species and as a predator, helping to maintain the balance of aquatic communities.\n\nPerca flavescens is a popular target for recreational anglers, known for its tasty flesh and sport fishing qualities. It is also commercially harvested, and its populations are managed by fisheries agencies to ensure sustainable exploitation. The species is generally considered to have a stable population status, although it may face threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species.",
