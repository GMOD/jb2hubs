  "description": "Perca fluviatilis, commonly known as the European perch or common perch, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Percidae. It is native to Europe and Western Asia, inhabiting a wide range of aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and brackish waters.\n\nThe European perch is a moderately-sized fish, typically reaching lengths between 20-40 cm (8-16 inches) and weighing up to 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs). It has a distinctive coloration, with a golden-olive or green-brown back, and dark vertical bars along its sides, which give it a striped appearance. The fins are reddish or orange, and the perch has a large, single dorsal fin with a spiny anterior portion and a soft-rayed posterior portion.\n\nPerca fluviatilis is an important prey species for larger predatory fish, as well as a target for recreational and commercial fisheries. It is an opportunistic carnivore, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including invertebrates, small fish, and even fish eggs and larvae. The species is known for its schooling behavior, particularly during the juvenile stage, and its ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions.\n\nConservation-wise, the European perch is generally considered a species of least concern, as it has a wide distribution and is not currently threatened with significant population declines. However, it can be impacted by habitat degradation, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species that may compete with or prey upon it.",
