  "description": "Perognathus longimembris pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific pocket mouse, is a subspecies of the little pocket mouse found in coastal areas of southern California, United States. It is a small, ground-dwelling rodent that belongs to the family Heteromyidae.\n\nThe Pacific pocket mouse is characterized by its small size, with a total length typically ranging from 12 to 15 centimeters. It has a stocky build, short, rounded ears, and a long, bicolored tail that is slightly shorter than the body. Its fur is soft and silky, typically grayish-brown in color on the back and white on the underside.\n\nThis subspecies is adapted to a desert and coastal scrub habitat, where it feeds on a variety of seeds, small plants, and insects. It is a nocturnal and burrowing animal, creating elaborate underground burrow systems for shelter and food storage.\n\nThe Pacific pocket mouse is considered an endangered subspecies due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its remaining populations in coastal Southern California.",
