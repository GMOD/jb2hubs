  "description": "Phaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1 is a single-celled marine diatom species that belongs to the class Bacillariophyceae. It is a widely studied model organism in the field of phycology, the study of algae.\n\nThe distinctive features of P. tricornutum CCAP 1055/1 include its unique tri-radiate or multipolar cell shape, which can vary from fusiform to triradiate or even cruciform. The cell walls are composed of silica, forming a characteristic frustule structure.\n\nThis diatom species is found in coastal and estuarine environments, where it plays an important role in the marine ecosystem as a primary producer. It is known for its ability to rapidly accumulate lipids, making it a promising candidate for biofuel production.\n\nPhaeodactylum tricornutum CCAP 1055/1 has been extensively studied for its metabolic versatility, genetic tractability, and potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of valuable compounds like lipids, pigments, and bioactive molecules.",
