  "description": "Phaethornis superciliosus, commonly known as the long-tailed hermit, is a small hummingbird species found in the tropical forests of Central and South America. This species belongs to the family Trochilidae, which comprises the majority of hummingbird species.\n\nThe long-tailed hermit is characterized by its distinctive long, slender bill and elongated tail feathers. It has a brownish-olive upper body and a pale, grayish-white underside. The most distinctive feature is the prominent white supercilium (eyebrow stripe) that extends from the bill to the back of the head.\n\nThis species is an important pollinator in its native habitat, feeding on the nectar of various flowering plants and trees. Its long, slender bill is adapted for reaching deep into flowers to extract nectar. The long-tailed hermit is known for its unique courtship behavior, where males perform elaborate displays and vocalizations to attract females.\n\nPhaethornis superciliosus is a resident species, meaning it does not engage in long-distance migrations. It is found in a variety of forest habitats, including primary and secondary forests, as well as forest edges and clearings. The species is considered to be of least concern on the IUCN Red List, with stable population numbers across its extensive range.",
