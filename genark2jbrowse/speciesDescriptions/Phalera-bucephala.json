  "description": "Phalera bucephala, commonly known as the Buff-tip moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Notodontidae. It is a medium-sized moth with a wingspan of around 50-65 millimeters.\n\nThe Buff-tip moth is characterized by its distinctive coloration, with a buff-colored body and wings that are largely brown with a pale buff or whitish tip, resembling the broken end of a twig. This camouflage helps the moth blend in with the bark of trees, where it typically rests during the day.\n\nThe larvae of the Buff-tip moth are also distinctive, being dark brown or black in color with yellow or white stripes along the body. They feed on the leaves of various deciduous trees, such as oak, birch, and hazel.\n\nThe Buff-tip moth is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, and it is a common sight in many parts of its range. It is an important part of the ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators and playing a role in the nutrient cycling of the forests it inhabits.",
