  "description": "Phallusia mammillata is a species of solitary sea squirt, also known as an ascidian, belonging to the phylum Chordata. It is a type of marine invertebrate that is sessile, meaning it is attached to a substrate and does not move freely.\n\nPhallusia mammillata is characterized by its barrel-shaped or cylindrical body, with a tough, leathery tunic covering the outer surface. The tunic is typically reddish-brown or gray in color, and may have small papillae or protrusions on the surface, giving it a mammillated or warty appearance, which is the origin of its species name \"mammillata.\"\n\nThe organism has two siphons, one for the intake of water (the incurrent siphon) and one for the expulsion of water and waste (the excurrent siphon). It uses these siphons to filter-feed, drawing in water and extracting suspended organic matter and plankton for sustenance.\n\nPhallusia mammillata is found in shallow marine environments, such as rocky coastlines and coral reefs, in the Mediterranean Sea and parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is an important component of benthic communities, contributing to the diversity and ecological balance of these marine ecosystems.",
