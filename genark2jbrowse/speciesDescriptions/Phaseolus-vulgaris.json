  "description": "Phaseolus vulgaris, commonly known as the common bean or kidney bean, is a species of bean that belongs to the legume family Fabaceae. It is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed legumes in the world.\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris is an annual herbaceous plant that can grow to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval-shaped and measuring 5-12 cm in length. The flowers are typically white, pink, or purple, and they produce long, green pods that contain the edible bean seeds.\n\nThe beans themselves are variable in size, shape, and color, ranging from small, round kidney beans to larger, flatter lima beans. They are a rich source of protein, dietary fiber, complex carbohydrates, and various vitamins and minerals, including iron, folate, and potassium.\n\nPhaseolus vulgaris is believed to have originated in the Americas, with evidence of its cultivation dating back to around 7,000 years ago. Today, it is grown in many parts of the world, with major producers including Brazil, India, the United States, and China.\n\nThe common bean is an important staple food in many cultures, and it is used in a wide variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and side dishes. It is also a valuable crop for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility and support sustainable agricultural practices.",
