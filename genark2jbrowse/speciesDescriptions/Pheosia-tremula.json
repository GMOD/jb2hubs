  "description": "Pheosia tremula, commonly known as the Aspen Prominent, is a species of moth belonging to the family Notodontidae. It is found in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nThe Aspen Prominent is a medium-sized moth with a wingspan of around 40-50 millimeters. The forewings are typically greyish-brown in color with darker mottling and markings, while the hindwings are pale grey. The species is named after its association with aspen trees (Populus tremula), which serve as the primary host plant for its caterpillars.\n\nThe larvae of Pheosia tremula are typically green or brown in color, with a distinctive hump on the thorax. They feed on the leaves of aspen trees, as well as other Populus species. The species undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the caterpillars pupating in the leaf litter or soil before emerging as adult moths.\n\nPheosia tremula is considered a common and widespread species throughout its range, and it plays a role in the ecosystem as a herbivore and a food source for various predators. The species is not currently classified as threatened or endangered.",
