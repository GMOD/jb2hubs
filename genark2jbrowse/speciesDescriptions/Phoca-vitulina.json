  "description": "Phoca vitulina, commonly known as the harbor seal, is a species of true seal that belongs to the family Phocidae. They are one of the most widely distributed pinnipeds, found along the coasts of the Northern Hemisphere, including the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Arctic Ocean, and the North Sea.\n\nHarbor seals are medium-sized, stocky seals with rounded heads and short snouts. They have a distinctive spotted or mottled coat, which can vary in color from light gray to dark brown. Their flippers are short and broad, and they use them to propel themselves through the water.\n\nThese seals are primarily aquatic and spend most of their time in the water, but they also haul out on land, often on rocks, sandbars, or isolated beaches, to rest, socialize, and give birth to their pups. They are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nHarbor seals are known for their adaptability and are found in a wide range of habitats, from estuaries and bays to open ocean environments. They play an important role in the marine ecosystem and are often used as indicators of the health of coastal environments.",
