  "description": "Pholis gunnellus, commonly known as the rock gunnel or butterfish, is a species of small, elongated fish that belongs to the family Pholidae. It is a benthic species, typically found in intertidal and subtidal zones of rocky and kelp-covered areas along the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.\n\nThe rock gunnel has a slender, eel-like body, with a long, continuous dorsal fin that runs along the length of its back. Its body is typically olive-green or brownish in color, with dark vertical bars or spots along its sides. This coloration provides camouflage, allowing the fish to blend in with its rocky and seaweed-covered habitat.\n\nThese fish are typically less than 20 centimeters in length and feed on a variety of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. They are known to be relatively sedentary, often found hiding in crevices or under rocks, and are an important part of the coastal ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predatory fish, birds, and marine mammals.\n\nPholis gunnellus is widely distributed across the North Atlantic and Arctic regions, and its populations are generally considered to be stable, with the species not facing any significant conservation concerns at this time.",
