  "description": "Phymastichus coffea is a species of parasitoid wasp that is known to attack the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), a major pest of coffee plantations. The species belongs to the family Eulophidae, which is a large family of small, mostly parasitic wasps.\n\nPhymastichus coffea is a tiny wasp, measuring around 1-2 millimeters in length. It has a black body and clear wings. The females of the species are responsible for parasitizing the coffee berry borer, which is the larval stage of the pest. The female wasp lays its eggs inside the body of the coffee berry borer larvae, and the wasp larvae then develop by feeding on the host, ultimately killing it.\n\nThis parasitoid wasp is considered an important biological control agent for the coffee berry borer, as it can help to reduce the populations of this destructive pest in coffee-growing regions. Research has shown that Phymastichus coffea can be an effective component of integrated pest management strategies for coffee production.",
