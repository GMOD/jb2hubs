  "description": "Physeter catodon, commonly known as the sperm whale, is a large, toothed whale species belonging to the order Cetacea. It is the largest of all toothed whales and one of the largest animals on Earth, with adult males reaching lengths of up to 20 meters (66 feet) and weighing up to 57 metric tons (63 short tons).\n\nThe sperm whale has a distinctive, large, box-shaped head and a single, S-shaped blowhole located on the left side of the head. Its body is dark gray in color, with a wrinkled appearance. Sperm whales are known for their deep-diving abilities, with some dives reaching depths of over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) in search of their primary prey, giant squid and other deep-sea cephalopods.\n\nSperm whales are found in all the world's major oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions. They are highly social animals, living in groups called \"pods\" and engaging in complex communication and social behaviors. Sperm whales play an important role in the marine ecosystem as top predators and as prey for orcas (killer whales).\n\nDue to historical over-hunting for their valuable spermaceti oil, sperm whales were once heavily depleted in population. However, with the implementation of international protection measures, their numbers have recovered to some extent, although they remain classified as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
