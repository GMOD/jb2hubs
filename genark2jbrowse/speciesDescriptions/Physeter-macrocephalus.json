  "description": "Physeter macrocephalus, commonly known as the sperm whale, is the largest of the toothed whales and one of the largest living mammals on Earth. This species is characterized by its massive, block-shaped head, which can make up to one-third of its total body length. The sperm whale has a distinctive, asymmetrical blowhole located on the left side of its head, which allows it to breathe while maintaining a streamlined shape during deep dives.\n\nSperm whales are known for their remarkable diving capabilities, with the ability to descend to depths of over 2,000 meters in search of their primary prey, deep-sea squid and fish. They use their large, conical teeth to capture and consume these prey items. Sperm whales are also renowned for their complex social structures and communication patterns, which include the production of a wide range of vocalizations, including the iconic \"click\" sounds used for echolocation.\n\nPhyseter macrocephalus is found in all of the world's major oceans, with a global population estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. Despite their large size and historical commercial whaling, sperm whales are now classified as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to ongoing threats, such as ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and the effects of climate change on their marine habitats.",
