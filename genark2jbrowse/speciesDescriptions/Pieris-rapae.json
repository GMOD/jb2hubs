  "description": "Pieris rapae, commonly known as the small white or cabbage white, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Pieridae. It is a small to medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of around 50-60 millimeters.\n\nThe upper wings of the male Pieris rapae are white with black tips, while the females have additional black spots on the upper wings. The underside of the wings is predominantly white with a slight yellow tint.\n\nThis species is native to Europe and Asia and has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Australia, where it has become a common and sometimes considered a pest species, particularly for its larvae that feed on cruciferous plants such as cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower.\n\nPieris rapae undergoes complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly) stages. The larvae are green with a faint yellow stripe along the sides and feed on the leaves of the host plants. The pupae are pale green or brown and attach themselves to various surfaces.\n\nThis species is known for its adaptability, ability to thrive in disturbed habitats, and its role as a model organism in various scientific studies, particularly in the fields of ecology, behavior, and developmental biology.",
