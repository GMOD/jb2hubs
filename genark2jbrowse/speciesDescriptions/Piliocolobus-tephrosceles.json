  "description": "Piliocolobus tephrosceles, also known as the Ugandan red colobus, is a species of primate belonging to the colobus monkey family. It is endemic to the central and western regions of Uganda.\n\nThe Ugandan red colobus is a medium-sized arboreal primate, with a distinctive reddish-brown coat and a long prehensile tail that aids in its movement through the forest canopy. The species has a specialized digestive system, with a large, multi-chambered stomach, which allows it to effectively digest the cellulose-rich leaves and unripe fruits that make up the majority of its diet.\n\nPiliocolobus tephrosceles lives in social groups, typically ranging from 10 to 30 individuals, and exhibits a complex social structure with well-defined dominance hierarchies. The species is known for its distinctive vocalizations, which include loud, resonant calls that are used for communication and territorial defense.\n\nDue to habitat loss and fragmentation, the Ugandan red colobus is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and the promotion of sustainable forestry practices, are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique primate species.",
