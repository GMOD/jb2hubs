  "description": "Pimephales promelas, commonly known as the fathead minnow, is a small freshwater fish species that belongs to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to North America, primarily found in the central and eastern parts of the United States and parts of Canada.\n\nThe fathead minnow is a small, stout-bodied fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 7.5 cm (3 inches). It has a rounded, blunt snout and a small, slightly upturned mouth. The body is generally olive-brown or dark brown in color, with a lighter belly and dark spots or bars along the sides.\n\nPimephales promelas is an important forage fish in its native range, serving as a food source for various predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife. It is also widely used as a model organism in ecotoxicological studies and environmental monitoring due to its sensitivity to pollutants and its ability to reproduce readily in laboratory settings.\n\nThe fathead minnow is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of aquatic habitats, including streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds. It is a hardy species that can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, such as temperature fluctuations, low oxygen levels, and turbid waters.\n\nPimephales promelas plays a crucial role in the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, contributing to the food web and serving as an indicator of environmental health. Its widespread distribution and adaptability have made it a valuable subject for research in the fields of ecology, toxicology, and evolutionary biology.",
