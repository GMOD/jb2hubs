  "description": "Piry virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Vesiculovirus within the family Rhabdoviridae. It is an enveloped virus with a bullet-shaped morphology, measuring approximately 180 nm in length and 75 nm in diameter.\n\nThe genome of Piry virus consists of approximately 11 kilobases and encodes five main structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L), which functions as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nPiry virus is primarily found in South America and has been isolated from various tick species, particularly those belonging to the genus Amblyomma. It is considered a zoonotic virus, as it can infect and cause disease in both animals and humans. In humans, Piry virus infection can lead to a febrile illness with symptoms similar to those of other arthropod-borne viral infections, such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances.\n\nThe transmission of Piry virus occurs primarily through the bite of infected ticks, although other routes of transmission, such as direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, have also been reported. The virus is capable of replicating in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, with ticks serving as the primary reservoir and vector for its maintenance and transmission in the environment.",
