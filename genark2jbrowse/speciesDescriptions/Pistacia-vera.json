  "description": "Pistacia vera, commonly known as the pistachio, is a species of tree native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the genus Pistacia, which is part of the cashew family, Anacardiaceae.\n\nPistacia vera is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall. The leaves are compound, with 3-7 oval-shaped leaflets. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, and the plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate trees.\n\nThe most well-known and economically important part of the Pistacia vera tree is its edible nuts, commonly referred to as pistachios. These nuts are produced in clusters and are initially green in color, but turn reddish-brown or beige as they mature and the shells split open. Pistachios are a rich source of nutrients, including protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals.\n\nPistacia vera is cultivated extensively in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as the United States, Iran, Turkey, and Italy, for the production of its highly valued nuts. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown as a landscape tree.",
