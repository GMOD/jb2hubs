  "description": "Plasmodium cynomolgi strain B is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Plasmodium, which is responsible for causing malaria in various host species, including non-human primates. Plasmodium cynomolgi is closely related to Plasmodium vivax, which is one of the primary human malaria parasites.\n\nPlasmodium cynomolgi strain B is specifically adapted to infect and replicate within the cells of the Crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the long-tailed macaque. This strain was originally isolated from a naturally infected Crab-eating macaque in Malaysia and has been extensively studied as a model for understanding the biology and life cycle of Plasmodium vivax in humans.\n\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium cynomolgi strain B involves the transmission of sporozoites from the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes to the host's bloodstream, where the parasites then invade and develop within the liver cells (hepatocytes). After a period of asexual replication in the liver, the parasites emerge and infect red blood cells, initiating the blood stage of the infection, which is responsible for the clinical symptoms of malaria.\n\nPlasmodium cynomolgi strain B serves as a valuable experimental model for studying various aspects of Plasmodium vivax biology, including the mechanisms of host cell invasion, drug susceptibility, and the development of potential vaccine candidates. The use of this non-human primate model has provided important insights into the complex interactions between the parasite and its host, contributing to our understanding of malaria pathogenesis and the development of improved prevention and treatment strategies.",
