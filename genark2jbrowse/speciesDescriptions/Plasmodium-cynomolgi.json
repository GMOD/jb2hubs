  "description": "Plasmodium cynomolgi is a species of malaria parasite that infects certain species of Old World monkeys, including the crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis). It is closely related to Plasmodium vivax, the causative agent of one of the most common forms of human malaria.\n\nPlasmodium cynomolgi has a complex life cycle that involves both the vertebrate host (the monkey) and the invertebrate vector (the Anopheles mosquito). The parasite is transmitted from one host to another through the bite of an infected mosquito. Once inside the monkey's body, the parasites undergo a series of developmental stages, including the invasion of liver cells (hepatic stage) and the invasion of red blood cells (erythrocytic stage).\n\nDuring the erythrocytic stage, the parasites can multiply rapidly, leading to the characteristic cycles of fever and other clinical symptoms associated with malaria. Plasmodium cynomolgi is also capable of forming dormant liver stage parasites (hypnozoites), which can reactivate and cause relapses of the infection at a later time.\n\nPlasmodium cynomolgi has been used as a model organism for studying the biology and treatment of malaria, particularly in the context of understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance and the development of new antimalarial drugs. However, it is not known to naturally infect humans, and its role in the epidemiology of human malaria is limited.",
