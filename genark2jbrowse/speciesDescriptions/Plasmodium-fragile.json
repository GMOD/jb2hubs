  "description": "Plasmodium fragile is a species of malaria parasite that infects non-human primates, primarily certain species of macaque monkeys. It is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Plasmodium, which is responsible for causing malaria in various vertebrate hosts.\n\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium fragile involves both sexual and asexual stages, similar to other Plasmodium species. The parasite is transmitted by the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, which act as the vector. Once inside the host's body, the parasites undergo a series of developmental stages, including the invasion of liver cells (hepatocytes) and red blood cells (erythrocytes), where they replicate and cause the characteristic symptoms of malaria.\n\nPlasmodium fragile is primarily found in Southeast Asia, particularly in areas where its natural hosts, such as the Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) and the Arunachal macaque (Macaca munzala), are present. It is considered a useful model organism for studying the mechanisms of malaria infection and the development of potential therapeutic interventions, as it shares many similarities with the Plasmodium species that infect humans.",
