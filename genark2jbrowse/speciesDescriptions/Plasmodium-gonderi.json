  "description": "Plasmodium gonderi is a species of malaria parasite that infects non-human primates, specifically the grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) in central Africa. It is a member of the genus Plasmodium, which comprises a group of unicellular, eukaryotic protozoan parasites that cause malaria in various vertebrate hosts, including humans, birds, and other mammals.\n\nPlasmodium gonderi, like other Plasmodium species, has a complex life cycle that involves both sexual and asexual stages, which occur in the mosquito vector and the vertebrate host, respectively. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito, which introduces the sporozoite stage of the parasite into the host's bloodstream.\n\nOnce inside the host, the sporozoites migrate to the liver, where they undergo asexual replication and develop into merozoites. The merozoites then invade red blood cells, where they continue to replicate asexually, leading to the release of more merozoites and the cyclic nature of the infection.\n\nPlasmodium gonderi is primarily studied as a model organism for understanding the biology and evolution of malaria parasites in non-human primates, which can provide insights into the broader context of malaria research and the development of potential interventions against the disease.",
