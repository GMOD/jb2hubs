  "description": "Plasmodium knowlesi is a species of malaria parasite that primarily infects long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, which are non-human primate species found in Southeast Asia. However, this parasite can also infect humans, causing a form of malaria known as \"zoonotic malaria\" or \"simian malaria.\"\n\nPlasmodium knowlesi is a single-celled eukaryotic organism that belongs to the Apicomplexa phylum and the Plasmodium genus. It has a complex life cycle that involves both a mosquito vector (the Anopheles mosquito) and a vertebrate host (the macaque or human).\n\nThe parasite is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito, which injects the parasite's sporozoite stage into the human host's bloodstream. The sporozoites then travel to the liver, where they multiply and develop into merozoites, which are released back into the bloodstream to infect red blood cells.\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the merozoites undergo further multiplication and development, ultimately leading to the production of new merozoites that can infect additional red blood cells. This cyclical process results in the characteristic high-fever episodes associated with malaria.\n\nPlasmodium knowlesi is considered an emerging public health concern, as it has been increasingly reported in various parts of Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia, where it has become the predominant cause of malaria in some regions. The accurate diagnosis and effective treatment of Plasmodium knowlesi infection are important, as the parasite can cause severe and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.",
