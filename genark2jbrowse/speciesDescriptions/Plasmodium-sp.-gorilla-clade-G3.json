  "description": "Plasmodium sp. gorilla clade G3 is a species of malaria parasite that infects western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) in Central Africa. It belongs to the genus Plasmodium, which includes a diverse group of protozoan parasites that cause malaria in various vertebrate hosts, including humans, non-human primates, and other mammals.\n\nThe Plasmodium sp. gorilla clade G3 is a member of the Laverania subgenus, which encompasses a group of closely related Plasmodium species that infect African great apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas. Genetic analyses have revealed that this specific clade, designated as G3, is distinct from other Plasmodium species found in gorillas, such as Plasmodium praefalciparum and Plasmodium falciparum-like parasites.\n\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium sp. gorilla clade G3 involves a complex series of developmental stages, including the asexual replication within the host's red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the sexual reproduction in the mosquito vector, typically Anopheles species. The parasites are transmitted between gorillas through the bites of infected mosquitoes, which act as the definitive host and vector for the parasite.\n\nThe discovery and characterization of Plasmodium sp. gorilla clade G3 have provided insights into the evolutionary origins and host-parasite relationships of malaria parasites, particularly the potential cross-species transmission between non-human primates and humans. Ongoing research aims to further understand the epidemiology, genetic diversity, and potential implications of this parasite for the conservation of western lowland gorillas and the broader ecosystem.",
