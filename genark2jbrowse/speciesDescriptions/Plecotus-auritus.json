  "description": "Plecotus auritus, commonly known as the brown long-eared bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. It is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, ranging from the British Isles to central Asia.\n\nThe brown long-eared bat is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of around 4-5 inches and a wingspan of approximately 9-11 inches. Its most distinctive feature is its large, rounded ears, which can be as long as its body. The fur is typically brown or reddish-brown in color, with a paler underside.\n\nThese bats are highly adapted to a life in the air, with their long, slender wings and agile flight. They are skilled at maneuvering in tight spaces, making them adept at hunting insects in forested environments. Their diet consists primarily of small moths, beetles, and other flying insects.\n\nPlecotus auritus is a social species, often roosting in large colonies in buildings, caves, and tree cavities. They are known to hibernate during the winter months, typically in underground sites such as caves or abandoned mines.\n\nThe brown long-eared bat is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats. However, like many bat species, it can be sensitive to disturbances in its roosting and foraging habitats, and conservation efforts are important to maintain healthy populations.",
