  "description": "Plenodomus lingam is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a plant pathogen that primarily infects members of the Brassicaceae family, which includes important crops such as cabbage, broccoli, and canola.\n\nThe fungus produces small, black, flask-shaped fruiting bodies called perithecia on the infected plant tissues. These perithecia contain asci, which are sac-like structures that house the fungal spores called ascospores. The ascospores are the primary means of dispersal and infection for this fungus.\n\nPlenodomus lingam can cause a disease known as blackleg or phoma stem canker in its host plants. The symptoms of this disease include the formation of dark, sunken lesions on the stems, leaves, and pods of the infected plants. These lesions can lead to the wilting and eventual death of the plant.\n\nThe fungus is known to survive in infected plant debris and can also be transmitted through contaminated seeds. Effective management strategies for this disease involve the use of disease-resistant cultivars, crop rotation, and the proper disposal of infected plant materials.\n\nOverall, Plenodomus lingam is an important agricultural pathogen that can have significant impacts on the production of Brassica crops if not properly managed.",
