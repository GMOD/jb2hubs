  "description": "Pleurobrachia bachei is a species of ctenophore, commonly known as a comb jelly or sea gooseberry. It is a small, spherical marine invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Ctenophora.\n\nPleurobrachia bachei has a transparent, gelatinous body that typically ranges from 1 to 3 centimeters in diameter. It possesses eight rows of beating cilia, known as comb rows, which create the appearance of moving \"combs\" and propel the animal through the water. The comb jelly has two long, retractable tentacles that are used for capturing prey, such as small crustaceans and other plankton.\n\nThis species is found in coastal and offshore waters throughout the northern Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Pleurobrachia bachei plays an important role in marine ecosystems, serving as a prey item for larger predators and contributing to the cycling of nutrients and energy within the food web.",
