  "description": "Poeciliopsis prolifica is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Poeciliidae, commonly known as the prolific livebearer. It is native to the coastal regions of northwestern Mexico, primarily in the states of Sinaloa and Sonora.\n\nPoeciliopsis prolifica is a small, live-bearing fish, with the females typically larger than the males. The species is characterized by a slender, laterally compressed body shape and a slightly upturned mouth. The coloration of the fish can vary, but generally, they exhibit shades of brown, olive, or greenish hues along their sides, with the ventral region being lighter in color.\n\nOne of the notable features of Poeciliopsis prolifica is its high reproductive capacity, as suggested by its species name \"prolifica,\" meaning \"prolific\" or \"producing many offspring.\" The females of this species give birth to live young, with the gestation period typically ranging from 4 to 6 weeks. The number of offspring produced in a single brood can vary, but it is not uncommon for a female to give birth to over 50 young at a time.\n\nPoeciliopsis prolifica is a hardy species that can adapt to a range of aquatic environments, including slow-moving streams, rivers, and even brackish waters. They play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity of their native habitats.",
