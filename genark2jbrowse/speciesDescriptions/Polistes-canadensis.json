  "description": "Polistes canadensis is a species of paper wasp native to North and South America. It is a social insect that lives in colonies and is known for its distinctive paper-like nest. \n\nThe Polistes canadensis wasp is relatively small, with a body length typically ranging from 15-20 millimeters. It has a slender, elongated body with a distinct waist connecting the thorax and abdomen. The coloration of Polistes canadensis can vary, but it is commonly yellow and black or reddish-brown and black.\n\nThese wasps are eusocial, meaning they live in colonies with a reproductive queen and non-reproductive workers. The nests are constructed from paper-like material made by chewing wood or plant fibers. The nests are often found attached to sheltered areas like the eaves of buildings or under tree branches.\n\nPolistes canadensis plays an important ecological role as a predator, feeding on other insects and caterpillars. They also contribute to plant pollination as they visit flowers in search of nectar. Overall, this species is a fascinating example of social insect behavior and nesting adaptations.",
