  "description": "Pollicipes pollicipes, commonly known as the goose barnacle or stalked barnacle, is a species of crustacean that belongs to the order Pedunculata. It is a marine organism that lives attached to rocky surfaces in the intertidal and subtidal zones of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the coasts of Europe and northwestern Africa.\n\nPollicipes pollicipes is characterized by its elongated, fleshy stalk or peduncle, which can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The stalk supports a series of overlapping plates or valves, typically five to eight in number, that form the barnacle's hard outer shell. These valves are typically white or greyish in color and can grow up to 5 centimeters in length.\n\nThe barnacle uses its feathery, cirri-bearing appendages to filter-feed on plankton and other suspended organic matter from the surrounding seawater. Pollicipes pollicipes is an important commercial species, particularly in Spain and Portugal, where it is harvested for human consumption.",
