  "description": "Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus that can cause a rare but potentially severe neurological disease in humans. It is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus serocomplex, which includes several other encephalitic viruses transmitted by ticks.\n\nThe virus is primarily maintained in nature through a cycle involving small rodents and ticks, particularly the groundhog tick (Ixodes cookei) and the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). Humans can become infected through the bite of an infected tick, although person-to-person transmission has not been reported.\n\nInfection with Powassan virus can lead to Powassan encephalitis, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Symptoms may include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, and seizures. In severe cases, the infection can progress to coma and death.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Powassan virus infection, and management typically involves supportive care. Efforts to prevent infection focus on avoiding tick bites, using insect repellent, and checking for ticks after spending time in areas where the virus is known to be present.\n\nOverall, Powassan virus is considered an emerging public health concern, particularly in areas where the virus and its tick vectors are expanding their geographic range. Continued research and surveillance are important to better understand the epidemiology and potential impact of this rare but serious tick-borne disease.",
