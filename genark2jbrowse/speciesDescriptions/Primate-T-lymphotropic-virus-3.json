  "description": "Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3 (PTLV-3) is a retrovirus that belongs to the genus Deltapapillomavirus within the family Retroviridae. It is a member of the primate T-lymphotropic virus (PTLV) group, which also includes the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types 1 and 2.\n\nPTLV-3 is primarily found in non-human primates, such as certain species of Old World monkeys and apes. The virus primarily infects and replicates within CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to the proliferation and transformation of these cells. This can result in the development of various hematological and neurological disorders in the infected host.\n\nThe genome of PTLV-3 is composed of single-stranded positive-sense RNA and encodes the typical retroviral genes, such as gag, pol, and env, as well as regulatory and accessory genes. The virus is transmitted through various routes, including direct contact with infected bodily fluids, vertical transmission from mother to offspring, and potentially through insect vectors.\n\nPTLV-3 infection has been associated with the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and various neurological disorders in infected non-human primates. However, the full extent of its pathogenic potential and distribution in primate populations is still an area of ongoing research and investigation.",
