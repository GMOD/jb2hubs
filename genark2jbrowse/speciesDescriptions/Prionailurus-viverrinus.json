  "description": "Prionailurus viverrinus, commonly known as the fishing cat, is a small wild cat species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive features, including a stocky build, short legs, and a long, thick tail that helps it maintain balance while hunting in water.\n\nFishing cats are primarily nocturnal and semiaquatic, with adaptations that enable them to thrive in wetland habitats, such as marshes, swamps, and mangrove forests. They are excellent swimmers and can dive to catch fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic prey. Their partially webbed toes and water-repellent fur help them navigate in the water efficiently.\n\nThese cats have a grayish-brown or tawny coat with dark spots or rosettes, which helps them blend in with their surroundings. They use their sensitive whiskers and keen eyesight to locate and pursue their prey, often stalking silently along the banks of water bodies before pouncing.\n\nFishing cats play an important role in the ecosystem, contributing to the balance of aquatic and terrestrial food webs. They are classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts aim to protect this unique species and its wetland habitats across its range.",
