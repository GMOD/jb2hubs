  "description": "Pristis pectinata, commonly known as the smalltooth sawfish, is a species of sawfish that belongs to the family Pristidae. It is a large, ray-like fish that is characterized by its distinctive elongated, toothed rostrum, or \"saw,\" which it uses to stun and catch its prey.\n\nThe smalltooth sawfish is found in tropical and subtropical coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the northeastern United States to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. It typically inhabits shallow, warm waters, such as estuaries, lagoons, and river mouths, where it feeds on a variety of small fishes and crustaceans.\n\nThe smalltooth sawfish is considered a critically endangered species due to a combination of factors, including overfishing, habitat loss, and low reproductive rates. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and threatened species, including the establishment of protected areas and the regulation of fishing activities.",
