  "description": "Prorops nasuta is a species of parasitic wasp that belongs to the family Bethylidae. It is a small insect, typically measuring around 3-4 millimeters in length.\n\nProrops nasuta is an important biological control agent, as it is known to parasitize the larvae of various wood-boring beetles, including the coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei), a major pest of coffee plantations. The female wasp lays its eggs inside the host larva, and the developing wasp larvae feed on the host, eventually killing it.\n\nThe species is found in various parts of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, where it plays a significant role in controlling the coffee berry borer population. Prorops nasuta has been the subject of extensive research and has been used in successful biological control programs to manage the coffee berry borer in coffee-producing regions.",
