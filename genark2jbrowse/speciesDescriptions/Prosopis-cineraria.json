  "description": "Prosopis cineraria, commonly known as the Ghaf tree or Shevri tree, is a drought-tolerant, evergreen tree species native to the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, and parts of South Asia. It belongs to the genus Prosopis, which is part of the legume family Fabaceae.\n\nThe Ghaf tree is well-adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its deep root system and ability to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall. It has a characteristic grey-green, finely divided, bipinnately compound leaves that provide shade and help conserve moisture. The tree produces yellow, globe-shaped flower clusters that develop into edible, bean-like pods.\n\nProsopis cineraria is an important species in its native regions, providing valuable ecosystem services such as soil stabilization, erosion control, and the provision of fodder, fuel, and timber. The tree's deep roots and nitrogen-fixing capabilities also make it an important component of agroforestry systems. Additionally, the species holds cultural and religious significance in many communities across its range.",
