  "description": "Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a fungal species that is the causative agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats. It is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus that thrives in the cold, humid environments typical of bat hibernacula.\n\nThe strain 20631-21 is a specific isolate of P. destructans that has been studied extensively. This strain was isolated from a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) affected by WNS in New York, United States.\n\nP. destructans 20631-21 is known to produce characteristic white fungal growth on the muzzle, wings, and other exposed skin of infected bats during hibernation. This fungal infection can lead to disruption of the bats' hibernation patterns, depletion of fat reserves, and ultimately, high mortality rates in affected bat populations.\n\nGenomic analysis of this strain has provided insights into the molecular mechanisms and virulence factors that enable P. destructans to infect and harm bats. The study of this specific isolate has contributed to the understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of white-nose syndrome, which has had devastating impacts on bat populations in North America.",
