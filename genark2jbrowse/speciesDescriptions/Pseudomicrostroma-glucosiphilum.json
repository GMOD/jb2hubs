  "description": "Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum is a species of unicellular, non-filamentous, aerobic bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan.\n\nThe cells of Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum are typically round or oval-shaped, with a diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 micrometers. They reproduce through binary fission and do not form any spores or other resistant structures.\n\nThis species is known to be chemoorganotrophic, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It can utilize a variety of monosaccharides, including glucose, as its primary carbon and energy sources. The optimal growth temperature for Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0.\n\nGenomic analysis has revealed that Pseudomicrostroma glucosiphilum possesses genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, as well as genes responsible for stress response and adaptation to various environmental conditions. Its ecological role in soil ecosystems is still under investigation, but it is believed to play a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients.",
