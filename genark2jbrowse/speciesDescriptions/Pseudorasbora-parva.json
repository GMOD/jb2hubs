  "description": "Pseudorasbora parva, also known as the topmouth gudgeon or stone moroko, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to East Asia, originating from the Amur River basin in China, Korea, and Japan.\n\nThe topmouth gudgeon is a small, laterally compressed fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 10 centimeters (4 inches). It has a rounded, blunt snout and a small, subterminal mouth. Its body is generally olive-green or brown in color, with a silvery-white underside. The fins are transparent, and the tail fin is slightly forked.\n\nThis species is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it has been introduced, either intentionally or accidentally, through the aquarium trade or the release of live bait. It is known to be a prolific breeder, with the ability to outcompete native fish species for resources, and can have a significant impact on local ecosystems.\n\nPseudorasbora parva is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including algae, plankton, and small invertebrates. It is also known to be a potential vector for the transmission of certain parasites and diseases, which can further threaten native fish populations.",
