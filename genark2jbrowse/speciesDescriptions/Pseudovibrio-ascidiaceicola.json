  "description": "Pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the inner tunic of an ascidian (sea squirt) collected from the coast of Japan. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Pseudovibrio within the family Pseudovibrionaceae.\n\nThe cells of P. ascidiaceicola are curved rods, typically measuring around 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. They are capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. The bacterium is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids as carbon and energy sources.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that P. ascidiaceicola is closely related to other Pseudovibrio species, which are commonly found associated with marine invertebrates, such as sponges and corals. The species is thought to play a role in the microbial community within the ascidian host, potentially contributing to the host's health and ecological interactions.",
