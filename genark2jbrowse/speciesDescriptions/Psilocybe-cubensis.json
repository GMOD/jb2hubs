  "description": "Psilocybe cubensis is a species of psilocybin-containing mushroom that belongs to the Psilocybe genus. It is commonly known as the \"magic mushroom\" or \"golden cap.\" This mushroom is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, and it is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of the hallucinogenic compounds psilocybin and psilocin.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Psilocybe cubensis typically have a cap that ranges from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown in color, and a stipe (stem) that is whitish in color. The spore print is dark purple-brown. The mushroom grows in areas with high humidity, such as on dung, decaying wood, or other organic matter.\n\nPsilocybe cubensis is considered a Schedule I controlled substance in many countries due to its psychoactive effects, which can include altered sensory perception, changes in mood and cognition, and, in some cases, visual hallucinations. The use of this mushroom for recreational or spiritual purposes is illegal in most jurisdictions.",
