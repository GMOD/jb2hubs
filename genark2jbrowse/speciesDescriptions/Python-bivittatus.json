  "description": "Python bivittatus, commonly known as the Burmese python, is a large, non-venomous snake species native to tropical Southeast Asia. This semi-arboreal python is found in various habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, swamps, and grasslands.\n\nThe Burmese python is a robust, heavy-bodied snake that can grow up to 6 meters (19.7 feet) in length, making it one of the largest snake species in the world. Its coloration is typically a dark brown or black background with irregular, light-colored blotches or \"saddles\" along its body, which help camouflage the snake in its natural environment.\n\nThese pythons are known for their ambush-style hunting strategy, where they use their powerful constrictor muscles to coil around and suffocate their prey, which typically includes small to medium-sized mammals, birds, and even young deer or pigs. Burmese pythons are ectothermic, meaning they regulate their body temperature by behavioral means, such as basking in the sun or seeking out warm areas.\n\nThe species is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation, as well as poaching for the international pet trade. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and manage wild populations of the Burmese python across its native range.",
