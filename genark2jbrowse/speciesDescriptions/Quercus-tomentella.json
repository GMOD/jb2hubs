  "description": "Quercus tomentella, commonly known as the island oak or woolly island oak, is a species of oak tree native to the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California, United States. It is an evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters (66 feet) tall.\n\nThe leaves of Quercus tomentella are oblong to oval in shape, 5-15 cm (2-6 inches) long, and have a distinctive woolly or tomentose texture on the underside. The upper leaf surface is dark green and shiny, while the lower surface is densely covered with soft, gray-white hairs.\n\nThe acorns produced by Quercus tomentella are ovoid or ellipsoid in shape, 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 inches) long, and have a scaly, pubescent (hairy) cap that covers about half the length of the nut.\n\nThis species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the Channel Islands, with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is an important component of the island's oak woodland and chaparral ecosystems, providing food and habitat for a variety of wildlife.\n\nQuercus tomentella is considered vulnerable due to its limited geographic range and threats from invasive species, climate change, and human development on the islands. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important oak species.",
