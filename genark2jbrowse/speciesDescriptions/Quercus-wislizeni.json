  "description": "Quercus wislizeni, commonly known as the interior live oak or Wislizenus oak, is a species of evergreen oak tree native to the western United States. It is a member of the white oak group (Quercus section Quercus) and is characterized by its leathery, dark green, oblong-elliptic leaves with wavy or spiny margins.\n\nThe interior live oak is a medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 10-20 meters (33-66 feet) tall. Its bark is dark gray and deeply fissured. The acorns produced by this species are oval-shaped, with a shallow, scaly cup that covers about a quarter to a third of the nut.\n\nQuercus wislizeni is adapted to the dry, hot conditions of the interior regions of the western United States, including parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. It is an important component of the oak woodlands and chaparral plant communities in these areas, providing food and habitat for a variety of wildlife species.\n\nThe interior live oak is known for its drought tolerance, fire resistance, and ability to thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is a significant ecological and cultural resource for the indigenous peoples of the region and is also valued for its timber, landscaping, and wildlife conservation purposes.",
