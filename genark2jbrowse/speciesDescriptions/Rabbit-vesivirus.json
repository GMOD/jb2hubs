  "description": "Rabbit vesivirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The rabbit vesivirus is specifically classified within the Vesivirus genus of the Caliciviridae family.\n\nThe virus particles of rabbit vesivirus are approximately 35-40 nanometers in diameter and have a characteristic icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is approximately 8 kilobases in length and encodes for several structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nRabbit vesivirus is known to infect and cause disease in rabbits, resulting in a condition known as rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease (RVHD). The virus can be transmitted between rabbits through various routes, including direct contact, contaminated environments, and insect vectors. Infection with rabbit vesivirus can lead to severe clinical symptoms, such as fever, lethargy, internal bleeding, and high mortality rates in affected rabbit populations.\n\nRabbit vesivirus is an important pathogen in the rabbit industry and has significant economic and ecological implications for rabbit farming and wildlife management. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of this virus is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies to mitigate its impact on rabbit populations.",
