  "description": "Reston ebolavirus is a member of the Ebolavirus genus within the Filoviridae family. It is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is closely related to the more well-known Ebola virus species.\n\nReston ebolavirus was first identified in 1989 during an outbreak among a group of research monkeys in Reston, Virginia, United States. Unlike the other Ebola virus species, Reston ebolavirus is not known to cause disease in humans, although it can infect and be lethal to certain non-human primates.\n\nThe virus is believed to be primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Reston ebolavirus has a similar genetic structure and morphology to other Ebola viruses, but it exhibits some distinct genomic and phenotypic characteristics that differentiate it from the more pathogenic Ebola virus species found in Africa.\n\nWhile Reston ebolavirus does not pose a significant threat to human health, it remains an important subject of scientific study to better understand the evolution, ecology, and zoonotic potential of filoviruses in general.",
