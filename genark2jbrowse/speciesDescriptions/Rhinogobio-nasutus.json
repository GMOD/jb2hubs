  "description": "Rhinogobio nasutus, commonly known as the long-snout gudgeon, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Gobionidae. It is native to the Amur River basin, which spans across northeastern China, the Russian Far East, and North Korea.\n\nThe long-snout gudgeon is a small, elongated fish with a distinctive pointed snout, which is the source of its scientific name. It typically grows to a maximum length of around 15 centimeters (6 inches). The body is covered in small, cycloid scales, and the fins are relatively small. The coloration is generally olive-brown on the back, fading to a lighter, silvery-white on the belly.\n\nThis species inhabits slow-moving rivers, streams, and lakes, often preferring areas with sandy or gravel substrates. It is a benthic fish, feeding primarily on small invertebrates, such as insect larvae and crustaceans, that it forages for on the bottom of the water body.\n\nRhinogobio nasutus is an important component of the local freshwater ecosystems within its native range, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity and functional dynamics of the aquatic communities it inhabits.",
