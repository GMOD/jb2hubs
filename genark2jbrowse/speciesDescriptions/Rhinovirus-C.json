  "description": "Rhinovirus C (RV-C) is a species of human rhinovirus, a type of picornavirus, that causes common cold symptoms in humans. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid structure.\n\nRV-C is genetically distinct from the more well-known Rhinovirus A and Rhinovirus B species, with unique genetic and structural features. It was first identified in 2006 and is now recognized as a significant cause of respiratory illnesses, particularly in children and individuals with underlying respiratory conditions.\n\nRV-C utilizes a different cellular receptor, cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3), for host cell entry compared to the receptors used by RV-A and RV-B. This allows RV-C to infect a broader range of host cells and potentially contribute to its pathogenicity.\n\nInfection with RV-C can lead to symptoms such as nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, and fever, similar to other common cold-causing rhinoviruses. However, RV-C has been associated with more severe respiratory illnesses, including exacerbations of asthma and increased risk of hospitalization, particularly in young children.\n\nUnderstanding the molecular biology, epidemiology, and clinical implications of RV-C is an active area of research, as it provides insights into the diversity and adaptability of human rhinoviruses and their impact on public health.",
