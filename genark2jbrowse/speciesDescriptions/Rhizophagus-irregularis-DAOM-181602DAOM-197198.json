  "description": "Rhizophagus irregularis (formerly known as Glomus intraradices) is a species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) that forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of various plant species. This mycorrhizal fungus is widely distributed globally and plays a crucial role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nRhizophagus irregularis is an obligate biotroph, meaning it relies on the living host plant for its survival and nutrient acquisition. The fungus colonizes the roots of the plant, forming specialized structures called arbuscules, which facilitate the exchange of nutrients between the plant and the fungus. The plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates, while the fungus enhances the plant's access to water and mineral nutrients, particularly phosphorus, from the soil.\n\nThe strain DAOM 181602 (also known as DAOM 197198) is a well-studied isolate of Rhizophagus irregularis, which has been widely used in scientific research and as a commercial inoculant for agricultural and horticultural applications. This strain has been found to exhibit genetic and functional diversity, with the potential to adapt to different environmental conditions and host plant species.\n\nOverall, Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 181602 is an important component of the soil microbiome, contributing to the overall health and productivity of plant communities through its symbiotic interactions.",
