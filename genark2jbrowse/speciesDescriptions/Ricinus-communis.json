  "description": "Ricinus communis, commonly known as the castor bean or castor oil plant, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is a fast-growing, annual or perennial, shrub-like plant that can reach up to 12 meters in height.\n\nThe plant is native to the southeastern Mediterranean region and Eastern Africa, but it is now widely cultivated and naturalized in many tropical and temperate regions around the world. Ricinus communis is known for its large, palmate leaves that can be green, reddish, or purplish in color, and its distinctive, spiny seed pods that contain the castor beans.\n\nCastor beans contain a potent toxin called ricin, which can be harmful to humans and animals if ingested. However, the oil extracted from the beans, known as castor oil, has a wide range of industrial and medicinal applications, including as a laxative, a lubricant, and a fuel source.\n\nRicinus communis is an important crop plant, and its cultivation and processing have significant economic and industrial importance in many regions of the world. The plant's adaptability, rapid growth, and versatile uses make it a valuable and widely-studied species in the fields of agriculture, botany, and industrial chemistry.",
