  "description": "Rickenella mellea is a species of fungus belonging to the genus Rickenella, which is a group of small, inconspicuous mushrooms found growing on the ground or on decaying wood. The species name \"mellea\" refers to the honey-colored cap of the mushroom.\n\nR. mellea is a small, delicate mushroom with a convex to flat cap that typically measures between 1-3 cm in diameter. The cap is smooth and honey-colored, sometimes with a slightly darker center. The thin, fragile stem is usually a pale shade of yellow or white, and the gills are closely spaced and decurrent, meaning they extend down the length of the stem.\n\nMicroscopically, R. mellea features smooth, elliptical spores that measure approximately 6-8 Î¼m in length. The fungus is considered a saprotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from decomposing organic matter in the environment.\n\nR. mellea is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where it can be found growing solitarily or in small clusters on the forest floor or on decaying wood. While not considered a highly prized edible species, it is sometimes collected and consumed by mycophilic individuals.",
