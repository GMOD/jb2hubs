  "description": "Rickettsia felis is a species of Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that belongs to the genus Rickettsia. It is the causative agent of flea-borne spotted fever, also known as cat flea typhus or cat flea rickettsiosis.\n\nRickettsia felis is a small, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium that measures approximately 0.5-2 micrometers in length. It is an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning it can only replicate and survive within the living cells of its host organisms, which include various species of fleas, primarily the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis).\n\nThe bacteria are transmitted primarily through the bite of infected fleas, as well as through contact with flea feces or contaminated environments. Once inside the host cells, Rickettsia felis can spread to various tissues and organs, including the skin, lymph nodes, and the vascular endothelium.\n\nInfection with Rickettsia felis can lead to a range of clinical symptoms in humans, including fever, headache, rash, and lymphadenopathy. The disease is generally considered to be milder than other spotted fever group rickettsioses, but it can still cause significant morbidity if left untreated.\n\nDiagnosis of Rickettsia felis infection typically involves serological tests, such as indirect immunofluorescence assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, to detect the presence of specific antibodies. Treatment often includes the use of antibiotics, such as doxycycline or chloramphenicol, which are effective in clearing the infection.",
