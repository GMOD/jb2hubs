  "description": "Rickettsia tamurae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Rickettsia. It is an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning it can only replicate and survive within the cells of its host organism.\n\nRickettsia tamurae is a Gram-negative, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium that is typically 0.5-2 Î¼m in size. It is a member of the spotted fever group of Rickettsia, which are known to cause various tick-borne diseases in humans.\n\nThe primary reservoir and vector for Rickettsia tamurae are ticks, specifically the Amblyomma testudinarium tick. The bacterium is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick, and it can cause a disease known as Japanese spotted fever, which is characterized by fever, rash, and eschar (a type of skin lesion).\n\nRickettsia tamurae is found primarily in Japan, where it was first isolated and identified in 2002. It is considered an emerging pathogen, and further research is needed to fully understand its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and potential public health impact.",
