  "description": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic virus that belongs to the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is primarily transmitted by infected mosquitoes, particularly from the Aedes and Culex species, and can infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, and camels.\n\nRVFV is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a tripartite genome. The virus can cause severe disease in both humans and animals, leading to a range of clinical manifestations, such as acute febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and retinitis.\n\nIn humans, RVFV infection can result in a flu-like illness, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, and weakness. In severe cases, the virus can cause liver damage, resulting in hemorrhagic fever, and in some instances, can lead to neurological complications, such as encephalitis.\n\nThe virus is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the Rift Valley region, but outbreaks have also been reported in other parts of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Middle East. RVFV is considered a significant public health concern due to its potential for epidemic spread and the severe consequences it can have on both human and animal health.\n\nEffective prevention and control of RVFV rely on integrated approaches, including vector control, animal vaccination, and public health surveillance, as well as the development of effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions.",
