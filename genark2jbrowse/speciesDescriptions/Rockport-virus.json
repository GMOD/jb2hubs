  "description": "Rockport virus is a species of bunyavirus that belongs to the Orthobunyavirus genus. It was first isolated from ticks (Ixodes scapularis) collected in Rockport, Massachusetts, United States in the 1980s.\n\nRockport virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The viral genome consists of three segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L). The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nRockport virus is primarily maintained in nature through a tick-rodent transmission cycle, with small mammals such as white-footed mice serving as the primary reservoir hosts. Humans can become infected through the bite of infected ticks, but Rockport virus is not known to cause significant disease in humans.\n\nThe ecological and epidemiological characteristics of Rockport virus are still not fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential public health impact and role in tick-borne disease dynamics.",
