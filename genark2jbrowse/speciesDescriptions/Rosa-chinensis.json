  "description": "Rosa chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese rose or China rose, is a species of rose native to China. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. The leaves are compound, with 3-7 leaflets, and the flowers are typically single, with five petals, and range in color from pink to red.\n\nThe Rosa chinensis species is known for its ability to bloom throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscaping. It is also a parent species to many modern rose cultivars, contributing its repeat-flowering and disease-resistance traits.\n\nBotanically, the species is characterized by its small, globular hips (the fruit of the rose plant) and its tendency to produce both prickles and glandular hairs on the stems and leaves. The flowers of Rosa chinensis have a delicate, slightly spicy fragrance, which has contributed to its popularity in perfume and aromatherapy applications.\n\nOverall, the Rosa chinensis is an important and widely cultivated rose species that has played a significant role in the development of modern rose horticulture and breeding.",
