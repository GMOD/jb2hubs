  "description": "Ross River virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that is endemic to Australia and the surrounding regions. It is the causative agent of Ross River fever, a non-fatal but debilitating disease characterized by joint pain, muscle aches, fever, and rash.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted by various Aedes and Culex mosquito species, with marsupial mammals such as kangaroos and wallabies serving as the primary reservoir hosts. Humans become infected when bitten by a virus-carrying mosquito.\n\nUpon infection, the virus replicates within the host's cells, particularly in the joints, muscles, and skin, leading to the development of the characteristic symptoms. The disease is generally self-limiting, with most patients recovering within a few weeks, though some may experience prolonged joint and muscle pain.\n\nDiagnosis of Ross River virus infection is typically done through serological tests that detect the presence of specific antibodies. Treatment is primarily supportive, focusing on managing the symptoms and preventing complications. Preventive measures involve mosquito control and personal protection against mosquito bites in endemic areas.",
