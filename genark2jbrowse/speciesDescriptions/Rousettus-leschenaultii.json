  "description": "Rousettus leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's rousette or the Indian flying fox, is a species of megabat native to South and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the genus Rousettus, which are known as fruit bats or flying foxes.\n\nThe Leschenault's rousette is a medium-sized bat with a wingspan that can reach up to 1 meter. It has a robust, stocky build with a large head and prominent eyes. The fur is generally reddish-brown to dark brown in color, and the wings are black or dark brown. These bats are known to roost in large colonies, often in caves, old buildings, or dense tree foliages.\n\nAs a fruit bat, Rousettus leschenaultii plays an important role in the ecosystem by acting as a seed disperser and pollinator for various plant species. They feed primarily on fruits, nectar, and pollen, and are known to travel long distances in search of food resources.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, and parts of Southeast Asia. While they are not currently considered threatened, their populations may be affected by habitat loss, hunting, and disturbance of their roosting sites.",
