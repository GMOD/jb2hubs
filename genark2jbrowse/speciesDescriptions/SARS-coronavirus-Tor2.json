  "description": "SARS-CoV-Tor2 is a strain of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is the causative agent of the SARS disease outbreak that occurred in 2003. The Tor2 strain was isolated from a patient in Toronto, Canada, during the SARS epidemic.\n\nSARS-CoV-Tor2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae. The virus has a spherical shape and is approximately 80-120 nanometers in diameter. Its genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides, encoding for various structural and non-structural proteins that are essential for the virus's replication and pathogenesis.\n\nThe Tor2 strain of SARS-CoV shares a high degree of genetic similarity with other SARS-CoV isolates, but it also possesses some unique genetic signatures that may have influenced its transmission and virulence characteristics during the 2003 outbreak. Researchers continue to study the Tor2 strain and other SARS-CoV variants to better understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential future outbreaks of this important human pathogen.",
