  "description": "SFTS virus HB29 is a member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is a tick-borne virus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a serious and potentially fatal infectious disease in humans.\n\nThe SFTS virus HB29 strain was first isolated from a patient in Hubei province, China, in 2010. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a tripartite genome consisting of small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments.\n\nGenetically, the SFTS virus HB29 strain is closely related to other SFTS virus isolates found in China, but it possesses unique genetic signatures that distinguish it from other strains. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks, and it can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their body fluids.\n\nSFTS caused by the HB29 strain is characterized by high fever, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and multi-organ dysfunction. The disease can lead to severe complications, including hemorrhage, organ failure, and a high case-fatality rate, making it a significant public health concern in affected regions.",
