  "description": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C is a widely used laboratory strain of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strain is a haploid derivative of the S288C reference genome, which was the first eukaryotic organism to have its complete genome sequenced.\n\nS. cerevisiae S288C is a unicellular, eukaryotic microorganism that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum of fungi. It is a non-pathogenic, aerobic organism that can reproduce asexually through a process called budding, where a new cell, or \"bud,\" forms from the parent cell.\n\nThe S288C strain is particularly useful in scientific research due to its well-characterized genome, extensive genetic and molecular tools available, and its ability to grow rapidly and robustly in laboratory conditions. It has been extensively studied as a model organism for understanding fundamental cellular processes, such as cell division, gene expression, and metabolic pathways, which have broad relevance to other eukaryotic organisms, including humans.\n\nOverall, the S288C strain of S. cerevisiae is a valuable tool in the field of molecular biology, genetics, and biochemistry, contributing to our understanding of eukaryotic cell biology and the development of various biotechnological applications.",
