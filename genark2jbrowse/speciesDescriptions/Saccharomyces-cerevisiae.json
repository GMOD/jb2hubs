  "description": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as baker's yeast or brewer's yeast, is a species of unicellular fungus belonging to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a eukaryotic organism, characterized by a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.\n\nS. cerevisiae is a widely studied model organism due to its simple cellular structure, rapid growth, and ease of genetic manipulation. It is a facultative anaerobe, capable of both aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation, the latter of which is responsible for its use in the production of bread, beer, and wine.\n\nThe cells of S. cerevisiae are typically spherical or oval-shaped, ranging from 5 to 10 micrometers in diameter. They reproduce asexually through a process called budding, where a new cell emerges as a small protrusion from the parent cell and gradually expands in size.\n\nS. cerevisiae is known for its high ethanol tolerance and ability to thrive in a variety of environments, making it a valuable industrial microorganism. Its genome has been extensively studied, and it serves as a model organism for understanding fundamental cellular processes, such as cell division, signal transduction, and gene regulation.",
