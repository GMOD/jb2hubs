  "description": "Saccharomyces mikatae IFO 1815 is a species of yeast that belongs to the Saccharomyces genus. It was first isolated in Japan from a soil sample.\n\nSaccharomyces mikatae is a unicellular, eukaryotic microorganism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically oval or spherical in shape, with a diameter ranging from 3 to 6 micrometers.\n\nThis yeast species is classified as a Crabtree-positive organism, meaning it can produce ethanol as a byproduct of glucose fermentation, even in the presence of oxygen. Saccharomyces mikatae IFO 1815 is considered a wild-type yeast, and it has been used in various research studies to explore yeast genetics, evolution, and adaptations.\n\nThe genome of Saccharomyces mikatae IFO 1815 has been sequenced, providing insights into its evolutionary relationships with other Saccharomyces species and its potential applications in biotechnology or fermentation processes.",
