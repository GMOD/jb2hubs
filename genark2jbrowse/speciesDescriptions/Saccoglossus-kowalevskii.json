  "description": "Saccoglossus kowalevskii is a species of acorn worm, a type of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Hemichordata. It is a small, worm-like organism that lives burrowed in the sediment of coastal marine environments, typically in estuaries and tidal zones.\n\nSaccoglossus kowalevskii has a distinctive U-shaped digestive system, with a mouth and anus located at opposite ends of the body. It feeds by extending a proboscis-like structure from its mouth to collect detritus and microorganisms from the surrounding sediment. The body is divided into three main regions: the proboscis, the collar, and the trunk.\n\nThis species is an important model organism in developmental biology and evolutionary studies, as it shares some anatomical and genetic similarities with vertebrates, including the presence of a notochord-like structure during its larval stage. Saccoglossus kowalevskii has been used to investigate the evolution of chordates and the development of the central nervous system.",
