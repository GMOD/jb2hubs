  "description": "Saguarus midas, commonly known as the golden lion tamarin, is a small New World monkey species native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. It is a member of the Callitrichidae family, which includes marmosets and tamarins.\n\nThe golden lion tamarin is characterized by its distinctive golden-orange fur, which covers its body and long, bushy tail. It has a small, round head with large, expressive eyes and a pointed, upturned nose. The species is relatively small, with adults typically weighing between 500 and 750 grams.\n\nGolden lion tamarins are arboreal and primarily inhabit the upper canopy of the forest, where they forage for a variety of food sources, including insects, small vertebrates, and fruit. They are highly social animals, living in family groups of 2 to 8 individuals, and exhibit cooperative behaviors such as parental care and group foraging.\n\nThe species is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss and fragmentation in its native range. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding and reintroduction programs, have been critical in preventing the extinction of this charismatic primate.",
