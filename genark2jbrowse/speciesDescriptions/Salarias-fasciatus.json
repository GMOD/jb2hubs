It is native to the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian and Marquesan Islands.\n\nThe Salarias fasciatus is a small, elongated fish typically growing up to 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) in length. It is characterized by a distinct pattern of dark vertical bars or bands across its body, which give it a striking appearance. The fish has a small, pointed head and a single dorsal fin that runs along the length of its body.\n\nSalarias fasciatus is commonly found in shallow, coastal environments, such as coral reefs, rocky areas, and tide pools. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, algae, and detritus. The fish is known for its territorial behavior and can often be seen darting in and out of crevices and hiding spots.\n\nThis species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to the overall diversity and functioning of the marine ecosystems it inhabits. It is also of interest to aquarium enthusiasts and is sometimes kept in home aquariums.",
