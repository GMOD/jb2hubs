  "description": "Salivirus FHB is a virus that belongs to the genus Salivirus, which is part of the family Picornaviridae. Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nThe Salivirus FHB was first isolated from the saliva of a healthy human individual, hence the name \"Salivirus.\" It is a novel virus, and its specific host range and pathogenicity are not yet fully understood.\n\nStructurally, Salivirus FHB is believed to have an icosahedral capsid, typical of picornaviruses. The viral genome is composed of a single, positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes the necessary proteins for viral replication and assembly.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the epidemiology, prevalence, and potential clinical significance of Salivirus FHB in human populations. As a newly discovered virus, its impact on human health and its potential interactions with other pathogens are areas of ongoing scientific investigation.",
