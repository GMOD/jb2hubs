  "description": "Salmonella bongori NCTC 12419 is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Salmonella. It is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family and is known to cause salmonellosis, a common foodborne illness in humans and animals.\n\nSalmonella bongori NCTC 12419 is a non-typhoidal Salmonella serotype, meaning it is not associated with the more severe typhoid fever caused by Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhi. Instead, Salmonella bongori NCTC 12419 is typically associated with milder gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever.\n\nThe bacterium is known to be found in a variety of environments, including the intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals, and can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated food or water. It is an important public health concern, as it can lead to outbreaks of foodborne illness and is closely monitored by public health authorities.\n\nSalmonella bongori NCTC 12419 has been the subject of various scientific studies and is used as a model organism to understand the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and control of non-typhoidal Salmonella infections.",
