  "description": "Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Salmonella genus. It is a subtype of the Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, which is the most common and clinically relevant subspecies within the Salmonella genus.\n\nThe \"serovar Typhimurium\" designation indicates that this particular strain belongs to the Typhimurium serovar, which is one of the most prevalent and well-studied Salmonella serovars associated with human and animal infections. The \"str. 14028S\" refers to the specific strain designation, which is a widely used laboratory strain commonly employed in research and experimentation.\n\nSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It is motile, possessing peritrichous flagella, and can thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution and ability to infect a variety of hosts, including humans, animals, and plants.\n\nThis Salmonella strain is known to cause salmonellosis, a foodborne illness characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. It is commonly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, as well as through direct contact with infected animals or their environments.\n\nThe availability of the 14028S strain, along with its well-characterized genetic and phenotypic properties, has made it a valuable model organism for studying Salmonella pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, and the development of potential interventions and control strategies.",
