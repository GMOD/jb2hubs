  "description": "Salvelinus alpinus oquassa, also known as the Sunapee trout or the Oquassa trout, is a subspecies of the Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) found in a few lakes in the northeastern United States and eastern Canada.\n\nThe Sunapee trout is a small, slender fish typically reaching lengths of around 30 cm (12 inches). It has a distinct, bright reddish-orange underside and fins, especially during spawning season. The back and upper sides are typically a dark, greenish-brown color. \n\nGenetically, the Sunapee trout is closely related to other subspecies of Arctic char, but it has evolved distinct physical and behavioral characteristics adapted to the specific lake environments where it is found. It is a pelagic fish, spending much of its time in the open waters of the lakes.\n\nThe Sunapee trout is considered a glacial relict species, having survived in isolated lakes since the last ice age. It is classified as a vulnerable species due to its limited and fragmented distribution, as well as threats from invasive species and habitat degradation. Conservation efforts are underway to protect remaining Sunapee trout populations.",
