IW2-2015 is a small to medium-sized char, typically measuring between 20 to 40 centimeters in length. It has a streamlined, fusiform body shape, which is common among salmonid fishes. The species exhibits a distinctive coloration pattern, with a dark olive-green to brown back, silvery-white sides, and a bright red or orange-red belly during the spawning season.\n\nGenetic analysis and morphological characteristics have confirmed that Salvelinus sp. IW2-2015 is a distinct species within the Salvelinus genus, though its exact taxonomic relationship to other known char species is still under investigation. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecology, behavior, and evolutionary history of this newly discovered species.",
