  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species of virus called \"San Miguel sea lion virus 8\". This appears to be a made-up name, as there is no scientific literature or information available about a virus by this specific name.\n\nViruses are microscopic infectious agents that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. They are composed of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protective coat of protein. Viruses that infect marine mammals like sea lions would typically be described based on the specific virus family, genus, and species, rather than using a made-up name.\n\nWithout more details about the characteristics, host, or origin of this purported \"San Miguel sea lion virus 8\", I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Viruses are an active area of research, but any claims about a new or uncharacterized virus should be supported by evidence from peer-reviewed scientific publications before they can be considered factual.",
