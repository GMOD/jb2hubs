  "description": "Sapovirus C12 is a species of virus belonging to the Caliciviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Sapovirus C12 is known to infect humans and can cause acute gastroenteritis, often characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain.\n\nThe genome of Sapovirus C12 is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the viral non-structural proteins, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the viral capsid proteins. The viral capsid is composed of a single structural protein, which is responsible for the characteristic morphology of the virus particles.\n\nSapovirus C12 is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either through direct contact with infected individuals or by consuming contaminated food or water. The virus can also be transmitted through aerosolized droplets during vomiting episodes. Infection with Sapovirus C12 typically results in a self-limiting illness, and most individuals recover within a few days to a week.\n\nDiagnostic techniques for the detection of Sapovirus C12 include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Prevention and control measures focus on proper hygiene, hand washing, and safe food handling practices to reduce the risk of transmission.",
