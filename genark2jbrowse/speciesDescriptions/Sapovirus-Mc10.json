  "description": "Sapovirus Mc10 is a member of the genus Sapovirus, which belongs to the family Caliciviridae. Sapoviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals.\n\nSapovirus Mc10 is a specific strain or genotype of Sapovirus that was first identified in a human stool sample in Japan. Like other Sapoviruses, Mc10 is known to cause acute gastroenteritis, characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever.\n\nThe genome of Sapovirus Mc10 consists of approximately 7.5 kilobases and encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into several structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly. The virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, and outbreaks have been associated with contaminated food or water sources.\n\nSapovirus Mc10, along with other Sapovirus strains, continues to be an area of ongoing research to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential for development of diagnostic tests and treatment strategies to mitigate the impact of this important enteric viral pathogen.",
