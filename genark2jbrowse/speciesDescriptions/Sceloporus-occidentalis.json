  "description": "Sceloporus occidentalis, commonly known as the western fence lizard, is a species of lizard found in western North America. It is a member of the spiny lizard genus Sceloporus.\n\nThe western fence lizard is a medium-sized lizard, typically ranging from 5 to 8 inches (12 to 20 cm) in total length. It has a robust, flattened body and a long tail that can be as long as the body. The lizard's skin is covered in small, overlapping scales, some of which are pointed, giving it a spiny appearance.\n\nThe coloration of the western fence lizard can vary, but it is generally grayish, brown, or black on the upper body, with distinctive blue patches on the underside of the male's throat and belly. These blue patches can be used for social signaling and territorial display.\n\nThe western fence lizard is a diurnal species, meaning it is active during the day. It can often be seen basking on rocks, logs, or fences, where it uses its flattened body to absorb heat from the sun. These lizards are known for their ability to quickly run up and down vertical surfaces, which helps them escape predators.\n\nThe western fence lizard is an important part of the ecosystem, serving as a prey species for various predators, such as snakes, birds of prey, and small mammals. It also plays a role in the control of insect populations, as it feeds on a variety of insects and other small invertebrates.",
