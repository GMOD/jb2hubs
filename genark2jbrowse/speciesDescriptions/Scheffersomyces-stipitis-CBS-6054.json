  "description": "Scheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The yeast cells are typically ellipsoidal or cylindrical in shape, with a diameter ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 micrometers.\n\nScheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054 is known for its ability to ferment a wide range of sugars, including glucose, xylose, and arabinose, into ethanol. This property makes it a potential candidate for use in the production of biofuels and other industrial applications. The yeast is also able to grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which further enhances its versatility.\n\nTaxonomically, Scheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054 is classified within the genus Scheffersomyces, which is named after the German microbiologist Curt Scheffers. The species epithet \"stipitis\" refers to the yeast's ability to form sticky or adherent colonies.\n\nOverall, Scheffersomyces stipitis CBS 6054 is a well-studied and potentially valuable yeast species with applications in various biotechnological processes.",
