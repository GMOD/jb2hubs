  "description": "Schistosoma haematobium is a species of parasitic flatworm that causes the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia. It is the causative agent of urogenital schistosomiasis, a form of the disease that primarily affects the urinary tract.\n\nSchistosoma haematobium is a dioecious trematode, meaning it has separate male and female individuals. The adult worms live in the blood vessels surrounding the bladder and other pelvic organs of the human host. The female worms produce eggs that are released through the urine, and these eggs can cause inflammation, scarring, and damage to the urinary tract.\n\nThe life cycle of S. haematobium involves an intermediate snail host, typically from the Bulinus genus, in which the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction. The larval stages, known as cercariae, are released from the snail and can penetrate the skin of the human host, where they mature into adult worms.\n\nSchistosomiasis caused by S. haematobium is a significant public health problem in many parts of Africa and the Middle East, with an estimated 112 million people infected worldwide. The disease can lead to severe complications, including bladder cancer, kidney failure, and female genital schistosomiasis, which increases the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nControl and prevention of S. haematobium infection rely on a combination of mass drug administration, improved access to clean water and sanitation, and snail control measures.",
