  "description": "Schizophyllum commune H4-8 is a species of wood-rotting fungus that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is commonly known as the split-gill fungus or common split-gill.\n\nThis fungus is widely distributed globally and is found on decaying wood, such as fallen branches or tree stumps, in various forest ecosystems. The fungus plays an important role in the decomposition of woody materials, contributing to nutrient cycling in the environment.\n\nThe H4-8 strain of S. commune is a well-studied model organism in the field of fungal genetics and molecular biology. It has a haploid genome and a bipolar mating system, making it a suitable model for investigating fungal genetics, genomics, and developmental processes.\n\nResearchers have utilized the H4-8 strain to study various aspects of fungal biology, including the regulation of gene expression, the mechanisms of sexual reproduction, and the genetic basis of wood-decay capabilities. The genome of S. commune H4-8 has been sequenced, providing valuable insights into the genetic makeup and evolutionary relationships of this important fungal species.",
