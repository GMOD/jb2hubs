It is a pelagic, migratory fish found in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, including the seas around Europe and North America.\n\nThe Atlantic mackerel has a streamlined, fusiform body shape with a distinct forked tail. It typically ranges in length from 25 to 40 centimeters (10 to 16 inches) and can weigh up to 0.8 kilograms (1.8 pounds). The fish's dorsal side is a dark blue or greenish-blue color, with a silvery-white belly and flanks. It has a series of dark, wavy stripes along its back, which help in its camouflage and identification.\n\nAs a member of the Scombridae family, the Atlantic mackerel is known for its fast swimming capabilities, which are aided by its streamlined body and specialized fins. It is an important commercial and recreational fish, valued for its nutritious meat and oil. The species plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as a forage fish for larger predators, such as tuna, sharks, and seabirds.",
