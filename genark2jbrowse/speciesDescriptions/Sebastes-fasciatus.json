  "description": "Sebastes fasciatus, commonly known as the Acadian redfish or Atlantic redfish, is a species of rockfish belonging to the genus Sebastes. It is native to the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, found along the continental shelf from Newfoundland, Canada, to North Carolina, United States.\n\nSebastes fasciatus is a relatively small fish, typically reaching lengths of around 30-40 cm. It has a deep, laterally compressed body with a large, broad head. The fish's coloration is primarily red or reddish-orange, with dark vertical bars or bands along the sides of the body, which is the source of its common name \"Acadian redfish.\"\n\nThese rockfishes are found in cooler, deeper waters, typically at depths ranging from 100 to 700 meters. They are generally slow-growing and long-lived, with some individuals reaching ages of 50 years or more. Sebastes fasciatus is an important commercial and recreational species, particularly in the northern parts of its range, and has been subject to significant fishing pressure over the years.\n\nConservation efforts, including catch regulations and habitat protection, have been implemented to help maintain sustainable populations of the Acadian redfish. The species is currently listed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
