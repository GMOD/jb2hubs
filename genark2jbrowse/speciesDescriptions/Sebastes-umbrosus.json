The dusky rockfish is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal waters from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nThe dusky rockfish is a medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of around 40 centimeters (16 inches). It has a robust, compact body shape with a large, rounded head. The coloration of the dusky rockfish is generally dark brown or grayish-brown, with small darker spots or blotches scattered across its body and fins.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit rocky, reef-like environments, often in association with kelp forests or other complex underwater structures. Dusky rockfish are considered to be relatively sedentary, spending much of their time in a particular area or territory. They are predatory fish, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and other fish species.\n\nSebastes umbrosus is an important component of the Pacific Coast's marine ecosystem, serving as both a predator and prey within the food web. It is also of commercial and recreational importance, being targeted by fisheries in various regions of its distribution.",
