  "description": "Semnopithecus entellus, commonly known as the Hanuman langur or the common langur, is a species of Old World monkey found in the Indian subcontinent. It is a large, long-tailed primate with a distinctive black face, white ruff, and silver-gray fur.\n\nThe Hanuman langur is an arboreal species, primarily inhabiting dry and moist deciduous forests, as well as scrublands and urban areas. It is a highly social animal, living in multi-male, multi-female troops with a clear hierarchy. These troops can range in size from a few individuals to over a hundred.\n\nHanuman langurs are primarily folivorous, feeding on a variety of leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. They are known for their ability to adapt to a wide range of habitats and their role in the dispersal of seeds through their fecal matter.\n\nSemnopithecus entellus is an important species in Hindu mythology, where it is revered as the deity Hanuman, the monkey god. This cultural significance has contributed to the conservation of the species, although it still faces threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and human-wildlife conflict.",
