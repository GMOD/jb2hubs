  "description": "Serpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.3 is a fungal species that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a wood-decay fungus commonly known as the dry rot fungus or the house fungus. This variety, S7.3, is a specific genetic variant within the Serpula lacrymans species complex.\n\nSerpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.3 is a saprotrophic fungus, meaning it obtains its nutrients by decomposing and breaking down dead organic matter, particularly wood. It is known for its ability to cause significant damage to wooden structures, such as buildings and furniture, by rapidly colonizing and degrading the cellulose and lignin components of the wood.\n\nThe fungus typically forms a dense, brown or reddish-brown mycelium that can spread extensively through the wood, producing characteristic \"weeping\" or \"bleeding\" dripping patterns on the surface. Additionally, it can produce spore-bearing structures called basidiocarps, which release airborne spores to facilitate the dispersal and colonization of new substrates.\n\nSerpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.3 is a highly adaptable and resilient species, capable of thriving in a wide range of environmental conditions, including high humidity and low oxygen levels. Its ability to rapidly grow and spread, coupled with its destructive impact on wooden materials, makes it a significant concern in the field of building preservation and conservation.",
