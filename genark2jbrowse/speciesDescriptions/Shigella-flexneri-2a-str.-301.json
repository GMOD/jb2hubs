  "description": "Shigella flexneri 2a str. 301 is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Shigella. It is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen.\n\nShigella flexneri 2a str. 301 is a causative agent of shigellosis, a type of dysentery characterized by severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. It is capable of invading and replicating within the epithelial cells of the human intestine, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.\n\nThe genome of Shigella flexneri 2a str. 301 has been sequenced, revealing its genetic composition and providing insights into its virulence factors and adaptations to the human host. The strain 301 is a specific isolate that has been studied extensively to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Shigella flexneri.\n\nOverall, Shigella flexneri 2a str. 301 is a significant public health concern, particularly in developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation is limited, and it continues to be a subject of ongoing research to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
