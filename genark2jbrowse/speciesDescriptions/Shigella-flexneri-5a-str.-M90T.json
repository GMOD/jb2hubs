  "description": "Shigella flexneri 5a str. M90T is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Shigella genus. It is one of the causative agents of shigellosis, a severe form of bacillary dysentery, which is a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries.\n\nThis specific strain, M90T, is a widely studied laboratory model for Shigella flexneri serotype 5a, known for its virulence and ability to invade and replicate within the host's intestinal epithelial cells. The bacterium possesses a large virulence plasmid that encodes various effector proteins, which enable it to manipulate the host's cellular processes and evade the immune response.\n\nShigella flexneri 5a str. M90T has been extensively used in research to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Shigella pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, and the development of potential therapeutic interventions against shigellosis.",
