  "description": "Snowshoe Hare Virus (SSHV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family, specifically belonging to the Orthobunyavirus genus. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, particularly those of the Aedes and Culex genera.\n\nThe SSHV genome consists of three segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments, which encode the nucleocapsid protein, the glycoproteins, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively.\n\nSSHV is primarily found in North America, where it is known to infect a variety of mammalian hosts, including the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), as well as other small rodents and lagomorphs. The virus can cause mild to moderate illness in humans, with symptoms ranging from fever and headache to more severe neurological complications, such as encephalitis.\n\nGenetic and phylogenetic analyses have shown that SSHV is closely related to other Orthobunyaviruses, such as La Crosse virus and California encephalitis virus, which are also transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause similar health effects in humans.\n\nOverall, the Snowshoe Hare Virus is an important zoonotic pathogen that continues to be studied by researchers to better understand its ecology, epidemiology, and potential impacts on human and animal health.",
