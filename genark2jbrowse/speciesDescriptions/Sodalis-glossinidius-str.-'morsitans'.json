  "description": "Sodalis glossinidius str. 'morsitans' is a species of symbiotic bacteria that is found in the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.), a vector of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. This bacterium is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped microorganism.\n\nSodalis glossinidius str. 'morsitans' is an endosymbiont, meaning it lives within the cells of the tsetse fly. It is believed to play a role in the nutritional physiology and immune response of the tsetse fly, though the exact nature of its symbiotic relationship is still being studied.\n\nThis bacterial strain was initially isolated from the tsetse fly species Glossina morsitans, which is a major vector of African trypanosomiasis. The name 'morsitans' reflects the specific host association with this tsetse fly species.\n\nOngoing research aims to understand the genetic, metabolic, and ecological characteristics of Sodalis glossinidius str. 'morsitans' and its potential implications for the biology and control of tsetse flies and the diseases they transmit.",
