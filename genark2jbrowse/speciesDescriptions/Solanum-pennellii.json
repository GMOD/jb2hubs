  "description": "Solanum pennellii, also known as the wild tomato, is a species of plant in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to coastal regions of Peru and Ecuador, typically growing in arid and sandy environments.\n\nSolanum pennellii is a perennial, trailing or climbing vine that can reach several meters in length. The leaves are pinnately compound, with five to nine leaflets that are green in color and covered in small hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits that turn from green to yellow or orange when ripe.\n\nSolanum pennellii is closely related to the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and is considered a wild relative of the tomato. It is of interest to plant breeders and geneticists due to its resistance to various pests and diseases, as well as its potential to contribute beneficial traits, such as drought tolerance, to cultivated tomato varieties.",
