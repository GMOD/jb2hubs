  "description": "Solanum verrucosum, commonly known as the warty nightshade or Mexican potato, is a species of wild potato native to central Mexico. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows 30-60 cm tall.\n\nThe leaves of S. verrucosum are deeply lobed, measuring around 10-20 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that develop into small, round berries approximately 1-2 cm in diameter. The berries are green when immature and turn a yellowish-orange color when ripe.\n\nTaxonomically, S. verrucosum belongs to the Solanum genus, which is part of the Solanaceae or nightshade family. The species name \"verrucosum\" refers to the warty or verrucose appearance of the berries, which is a distinctive characteristic of this potato relative.\n\nSolanum verrucosum is considered a wild relative of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) and has potential value for potato breeding programs, as it may harbor genetic diversity and traits of interest for improving cultivated potato varieties.",
