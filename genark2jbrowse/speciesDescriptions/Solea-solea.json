  "description": "Solea solea, commonly known as the common sole or Dover sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Soleidae. It is a benthic marine fish, typically found in coastal waters and estuaries of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe common sole has a distinctive, oval-shaped body that is compressed laterally, with both eyes located on the right side of the head. Its upper side is typically brownish or grayish in color, blending with the seafloor to provide camouflage, while the underside is white. The fish's mouth is small and positioned on the blind side, with small teeth adapted for feeding on small invertebrates and crustaceans that live in the sediment.\n\nSolea solea is an important commercial species, valued for its delicate, white flesh and is widely sought after by both recreational and commercial fisheries. The species is known to exhibit complex reproductive behaviors, with adults migrating to specific spawning grounds during the spring and early summer months. The common sole is an important component of marine ecosystems, playing a key role in the transfer of energy and nutrients within the benthic food web.",
