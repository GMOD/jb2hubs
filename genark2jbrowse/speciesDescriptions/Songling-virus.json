  "description": "Songling virus is a recently discovered virus that belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus within the family Pneumoviridae. It was first isolated from a patient in Songling County, Hubei Province, China, in 2020.\n\nThe Songling virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 15.2 kilobases in length and encodes for nine major proteins, including the fusion (F) protein, attachment (G) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis suggests that the Songling virus is most closely related to other members of the Orthopneumovirus genus, such as the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV). However, it represents a distinct viral lineage, indicating that it is a novel species within the genus.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and can cause respiratory tract infections in humans, with symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract illness to severe pneumonia. Further research is ongoing to understand the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and potential public health impact of the Songling virus.",
