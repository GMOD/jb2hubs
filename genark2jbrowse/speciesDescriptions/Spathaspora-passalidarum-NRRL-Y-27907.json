  "description": "Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 is a species of yeast that was isolated from the gut of a passalid beetle (Odontotaenius disjunctus) in the United States. It belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, and the genus Spathaspora.\n\nThis yeast species is known for its ability to ferment a variety of sugars, including glucose, xylose, and cellobiose, making it a potential candidate for biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass. Spathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 is also capable of producing ethanol and other metabolites during the fermentation process.\n\nThe cells of this yeast species are typically ellipsoidal to elongated in shape, and they can reproduce both asexually, through budding, and sexually, through the formation of ascospores. The species is considered to be haploid, meaning it has a single set of chromosomes.\n\nSpathaspora passalidarum NRRL Y-27907 has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, particularly in the development of efficient bioconversion processes for the production of biofuels and other valuable products from renewable lignocellulosic feedstocks.",
