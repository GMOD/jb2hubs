  "description": "Spea bombifrons, commonly known as the Plains Spadefoot, is a species of burrowing frog found in the central and western regions of North America. This amphibian belongs to the family Scaphiopodidae, which includes spadefoot toads.\n\nThe Plains Spadefoot is a small to medium-sized frog, typically measuring between 4.5 to 7.5 centimeters in length. It has a distinctive appearance, with a rounded, \"chubby\" body and a short, pointed snout. Its skin is smooth and varies in color from olive-green to gray, often with darker spots or blotches.\n\nOne of the key features of the Plains Spadefoot is the presence of a hardened, keratinized \"spade\" on each of its hind feet, which it uses to burrow underground. This burrowing behavior is an adaptation to the arid and semi-arid environments it inhabits, allowing the frog to conserve moisture and avoid dehydration.\n\nThe Plains Spadefoot is primarily nocturnal and emerges from its underground burrows after heavy rains or during periods of high humidity. It is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and small rodents.\n\nReproduction in the Plains Spadefoot is closely tied to the availability of temporary, rain-filled pools or ponds. During the breeding season, males will gather at these aquatic sites and emit a distinctive, high-pitched call to attract females. The females lay their eggs in the water, and the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis to become fully developed frogs.\n\nThe Plains Spadefoot is widely distributed across the central and western United States, as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. It is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it may face threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change in certain regions.",
