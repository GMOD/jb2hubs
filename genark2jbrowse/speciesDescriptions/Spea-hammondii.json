  "description": "Spea hammondii, commonly known as the Western Spadefoot Toad, is a species of small amphibian belonging to the family Scaphiopodidae. This species is native to the western United States, primarily found in the southwestern regions, including parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico.\n\nThe Western Spadefoot Toad is characterized by its distinctive physical features, including a stocky body, short snout, and a large, spade-like projection on each hind foot, which it uses for burrowing. The species typically ranges in color from olive-green to brown, with darker spotting or blotching patterns on its back and sides.\n\nThese toads are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, where they burrow underground to avoid the harsh conditions on the surface. They emerge from their burrows during the rainy season, typically in the spring or summer, to breed and lay their eggs in temporary pools or puddles. The tadpoles then undergo a rapid metamorphosis, transforming into juvenile toads within a few weeks to avoid the drying of the water bodies.\n\nThe Western Spadefoot Toad plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a prey species for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the regions where it is found. However, the species faces threats from habitat loss, urban development, and the introduction of non-native predators, which can impact its population numbers in certain areas.",
