  "description": "Sphaeroforma arctica is a species of unicellular eukaryotic organism belonging to the phylum Ichthyosporea, a group of enigmatic protists closely related to fungi. It was first isolated from the Arctic Ocean near Svalbard, Norway.\n\nSphaeroforma arctica is a spherical or ovoid-shaped cell, typically measuring between 3-10 micrometers in diameter. The cell wall is made of chitin, a polysaccharide also found in the cell walls of fungi. The nucleus is large and centrally located within the cell.\n\nThis species reproduces asexually through the formation of multinucleate sporangia, which eventually release numerous small, flagellated zoospores. The zoospores can then settle and develop into new vegetative cells, completing the life cycle.\n\nSphaeroforma arctica is believed to play a role in the microbial food web of the Arctic marine ecosystem, potentially interacting with other microorganisms and serving as a food source for higher trophic levels. Its ability to thrive in the cold, nutrient-poor waters of the Arctic highlights its adaptations to the extreme environmental conditions of this region.",
