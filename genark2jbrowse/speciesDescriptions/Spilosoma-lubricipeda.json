It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nThe White Ermine moth has a wingspan of around 35-45 millimeters. Its wings are typically white in color, with dark spots or markings that can vary in size and distribution. The body of the moth is also white, with a hairy or fluffy appearance.\n\nThe larvae of the White Ermine moth, commonly called the \"woolly bear\" caterpillar, are covered in dense, black and orange-brown hairs. They feed on a variety of plants, including dandelions, plantains, and other herbaceous vegetation.\n\nThe species undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larvae pupate in a silken cocoon, and the adult moths emerge in the spring or early summer, where they can be seen flying at night or resting on vegetation during the day.\n\nThe White Ermine moth is considered a common and widespread species throughout its range, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem as a pollinator and as a food source for various predators.",
