  "description": "Spinachia spinachia, commonly known as the fifteen-spined stickleback, is a small marine fish species belonging to the family Spinachiidae. It is found in coastal waters of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and along the coasts of Europe and Scandinavia.\n\nThe fifteen-spined stickleback is characterized by its elongated, streamlined body and the presence of 15 dorsal spines, which are the highest number of spines among stickleback species. Its body is covered with bony plates, and it has a distinct, elongated snout. The fish typically ranges in length from 8 to 15 centimeters (3 to 6 inches).\n\nThis species inhabits a variety of marine habitats, including estuaries, harbors, and kelp beds, where it feeds primarily on small crustaceans, such as shrimp and copepods. The fifteen-spined stickleback is known for its elaborate courtship and nest-building behaviors, with males constructing intricate nests from plant material to attract and protect their mates during spawning.\n\nSpinachia spinachia plays a role in the broader marine ecosystem, serving as a prey item for larger predatory fish, birds, and other marine organisms. Its ecological importance lies in its contribution to the food web and its interactions with other species within its native habitat.",
