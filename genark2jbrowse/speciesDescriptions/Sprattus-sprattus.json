  "description": "Sprattus sprattus, commonly known as the European sprat, is a small, pelagic fish species belonging to the Clupeidae family. It is widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe European sprat is a small, slender fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 15 centimeters. It has a compressed, silvery-blue body with a prominent lower jaw and a deeply forked tail. The species is known for its schooling behavior, often found in large, dense aggregations.\n\nSprattus sprattus is an important forage fish, playing a crucial role in the marine food web. It feeds primarily on small crustaceans, such as copepods and mysids, and is a significant prey item for a variety of predators, including larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nCommercially, the European sprat is an important fishery resource, with catches used for human consumption, as well as for the production of fish meal and fish oil. Its population status is generally considered stable, although local declines have been observed in some areas due to factors such as overfishing and environmental changes.",
