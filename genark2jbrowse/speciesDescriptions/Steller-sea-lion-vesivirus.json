  "description": "Steller sea lion vesivirus is a member of the Vesivirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that primarily infects Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), a large species of sea lion found in the North Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Steller sea lion vesivirus is known to cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illness in Steller sea lions, and it has been detected in various populations of these marine mammals. The virus is believed to be transmitted through close contact, environmental contamination, or potentially through the food chain.\n\nGenetic analysis of the Steller sea lion vesivirus has revealed that it is closely related to other vesiviruses found in marine mammals, suggesting a common evolutionary origin and potential for cross-species transmission. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential impacts of this virus on Steller sea lion populations and their ecosystems.",
