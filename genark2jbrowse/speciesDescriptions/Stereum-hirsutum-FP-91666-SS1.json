  "description": "Stereum hirsutum FP-91666 SS1 is a species of wood-decaying fungus belonging to the Basidiomycota phylum. It is a member of the Stereaceae family and is commonly known as the Hairy Curtain Crust.\n\nThis fungus is a saprotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from the decomposition of dead or decaying wood. It typically colonizes the surface of fallen logs, branches, and stumps, forming thin, leathery, and hairy fruiting bodies that can range in color from yellow to reddish-brown.\n\nThe key distinguishing features of Stereum hirsutum FP-91666 SS1 include its hirsute (hairy) upper surface, which helps in its identification, and its ability to produce spores on the underside of the fruiting body. The spores are white in color and are released into the environment, contributing to the fungus's dispersal and reproduction.\n\nThis species is known to play a role in the decomposition of wood, contributing to the nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. It has also been studied for its potential medicinal properties, as some Stereum species have been found to possess antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.",
