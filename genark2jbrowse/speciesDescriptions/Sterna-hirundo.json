  "description": "Sterna hirundo, commonly known as the common tern, is a seabird species belonging to the family Sternidae. It is a medium-sized tern, measuring approximately 30-35 cm in length with a wingspan of 65-85 cm.\n\nThe common tern has a slender, streamlined body with a forked tail and long, pointed wings. Its plumage is predominantly white, with a gray back and wings, and a distinctive black cap on the head. The bill is narrow and sharp, and the legs are short and bright red.\n\nThese birds are migratory, breeding in temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America, and wintering in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. They are skilled aerial predators, diving into the water to catch small fish, crustaceans, and other marine prey.\n\nCommon terns are known for their social behavior, often nesting in large colonies along coastlines and on islands. They exhibit complex courtship rituals, including aerial displays and food-offering behaviors, and both parents share in the incubation of their eggs and the care of their chicks.\n\nThe common tern plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, serving as a predator and indicator species for the health of coastal environments. Conservation efforts are in place to protect this species, which has faced threats from habitat loss, pollution, and human disturbance.",
