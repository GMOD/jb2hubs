  "description": "Sternotherus odoratus, commonly known as the common musk turtle or stinkpot, is a small semi-aquatic turtle species native to the eastern United States and southern Canada. This species belongs to the family Kinosternidae, which are distinguished by their hinged plastron (lower shell) that allows them to partially enclose themselves for protection.\n\nThe common musk turtle has a domed, dark-colored carapace (upper shell) that can range from olive-brown to black in color. The plastron is typically yellowish or tan in color. These turtles are relatively small, with a carapace length typically ranging from 8 to 14 cm. One of the distinctive features of this species is the pair of musk glands located on the underside of the carapace, which can release a strong, musky odor when the turtle is disturbed, hence the common name \"stinkpot.\"\n\nSternotherus odoratus is a carnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and carrion. They are found in a variety of freshwater habitats, including ponds, lakes, slow-moving rivers, and wetlands, where they spend much of their time submerged or basking on logs or rocks.\n\nThis species is considered relatively common throughout its range and is not currently listed as threatened or endangered. However, like many other turtle species, they face challenges due to habitat loss, road mortality, and collection for the pet trade.",
