  "description": "Streptopelia turtur, commonly known as the European Turtle Dove, is a small migratory bird species belonging to the family Columbidae. This species is native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor, and is known for its distinctive plumage and characteristic cooing call.\n\nThe European Turtle Dove has a slender build, with a length of around 28-32 cm and a wingspan of 55-65 cm. Its plumage is characterized by a pinkish-brown head and neck, a purplish-brown back, and distinctive black-and-white markings on the wings. The bird's distinctive cooing call, often described as a \"tur-tur-tur\" sound, is a key feature that helps to identify this species.\n\nEcologically, the European Turtle Dove is a generalist species, feeding on a variety of seeds, grains, and small invertebrates. It is known to inhabit a range of habitats, including agricultural landscapes, woodlands, and urban areas. The species is a long-distance migrant, spending the breeding season in Europe and the winter months in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nDue to population declines in recent decades, the European Turtle Dove is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and conservation efforts are underway to protect its remaining populations.",
