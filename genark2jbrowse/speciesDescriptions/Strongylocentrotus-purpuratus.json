  "description": "Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, commonly known as the purple sea urchin, is a species of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. It is a herbivorous echinoid found along the western coast of North America, ranging from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nThe purple sea urchin has a spherical, radially symmetrical body covered in numerous movable spines, which can range in color from deep purple to reddish-brown. These spines serve multiple functions, including protection, locomotion, and the capture of food particles. The animal's mouth, known as the \"Aristotle's lantern,\" is located on the underside of the body and is used to graze on various types of algae and seaweed.\n\nStrongylocentrotus purpuratus plays a vital role in the marine ecosystem, as it helps maintain the balance between kelp forests and algal-dominated habitats. Its grazing activities can significantly impact the composition and structure of the local community. The species is also an important resource for various industries, including fisheries and the harvesting of its gonads, which are considered a culinary delicacy.",
