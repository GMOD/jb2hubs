  "description": "Sturnus vulgaris, commonly known as the common starling or European starling, is a species of passerine bird in the family Sturnidae. It is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring 19-22 cm in length and weighing between 60-90 grams.\n\nThe common starling is known for its distinctive black iridescent plumage, which can appear glossy green, purple, or blue, depending on the light. During the breeding season, the feathers are more pointed, giving the bird a speckled appearance. The beak is short, sharp, and pointed, and the legs are relatively short.\n\nSturnus vulgaris is a highly adaptable and opportunistic species, capable of thriving in a wide range of habitats, including urban and agricultural areas. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, larvae, and other invertebrates, but they also consume fruits, seeds, and grains.\n\nThese birds are known for their impressive flocking behavior, where they can form vast, swirling clouds of thousands of individuals, known as \"murmurations.\" This behavior is thought to serve various functions, such as predator avoidance, information sharing, and thermoregulation.\n\nSturnus vulgaris is a widespread and abundant species, with a large global population. It is considered a successful invasive species in many parts of the world, having been introduced to North America, Australia, and other regions, where it has had significant ecological and economic impacts.",
