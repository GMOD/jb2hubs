  "description": "Stylophora pistillata is a species of stony coral that belongs to the family Pocilloporidae. It is commonly known as the \"bottlebrush coral\" or \"bird's nest coral\" due to its distinctive branching morphology.\n\nStylophora pistillata is a widespread species found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in shallow, tropical and subtropical marine environments. It typically forms dense, bushy colonies with numerous slender, cylindrical branches that can grow up to several centimeters in length.\n\nThe coral's skeleton is composed of calcium carbonate, which is secreted by the individual polyps that make up the colony. These polyps are typically small, measuring only a few millimeters in diameter, and they are arranged in a radial pattern along the branches.\n\nStylophora pistillata is a zooxanthellate coral, meaning it lives in a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae reside within the coral's tissue and provide the coral with the majority of its energy through photosynthesis, in exchange for a protected environment and access to the coral's metabolic waste products.\n\nThis species is known to be relatively hardy and adaptable, capable of thriving in a wide range of environmental conditions, including varying levels of light, water temperature, and nutrient availability. However, like many other coral species, Stylophora pistillata is susceptible to the negative impacts of climate change, such as ocean warming and acidification, which can lead to coral bleaching and mortality.",
