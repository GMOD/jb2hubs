  "description": "Suhomyces tanzawaensis NRRL Y-17324 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in the Tanzawa Mountains, Japan.\n\nThis yeast species is characterized by its ability to ferment various sugars, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose. It can also assimilate a range of carbon and nitrogen sources, making it a versatile organism.\n\nSuhomyces tanzawaensis NRRL Y-17324 is a unicellular, haploid organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically round to oval in shape and can range in size from 3 to 6 micrometers in diameter.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of enzymes or other valuable compounds. Its adaptability to different environmental conditions and metabolic capabilities make it an interesting subject for further research and exploration.",
