  "description": "Suillus clintonianus is a species of fungus in the genus Suillus, commonly known as the Clinton's bolete. It is a mycorrhizal mushroom, forming symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain coniferous trees, primarily pines (Pinus spp.).\n\nThe cap of Suillus clintonianus is typically convex to flat, ranging from 5 to 15 cm in diameter, and can be yellow, olive, or brown in color. The pore surface is yellowish and bruises blue when handled. The stem is thick and bulbous, often with a ring or partial veil remnant near the cap. The spore print is olive-brown.\n\nSuillus clintonianus is found in North America, primarily in the eastern and central regions, where it grows in association with eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) and other pine species. It is considered an edible mushroom, though it may cause gastrointestinal discomfort in some individuals.\n\nThe species is named after former U.S. President Bill Clinton, as it was first described from a collection made near Clinton, Arkansas.",
