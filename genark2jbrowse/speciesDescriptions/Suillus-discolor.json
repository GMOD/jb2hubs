  "description": "Suillus discolor, commonly known as the variegated suillus or discolored suillus, is a species of edible fungus in the family Suillaceae. It is a bolete, characterized by its porous, spongy underside instead of gills.\n\nThe cap of Suillus discolor ranges from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and is typically convex in shape, becoming more flat with age. The cap surface is smooth and dry, and its color can vary from reddish-brown to yellowish-brown, often with patches of different shades. The pore surface on the underside of the cap is initially yellow, but it can stain blue or greenish when bruised or damaged.\n\nThe stipe (stem) is 5 to 15 cm long and 1 to 3 cm thick, and it is typically equal in width or slightly tapered towards the base. The stipe is usually the same color as the cap or slightly paler, and it may have a faint, membranous ring or skirt near the upper portion.\n\nSuillus discolor is found in coniferous forests, often in association with pines (Pinus spp.), and it is widely distributed across North America and parts of Europe. It is considered a desirable edible mushroom, although it should be cooked thoroughly before consumption to remove any potential toxins.",
