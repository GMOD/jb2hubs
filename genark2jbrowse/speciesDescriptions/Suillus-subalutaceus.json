  "description": "Suillus subalutaceus is a species of edible mushroom belonging to the genus Suillus, commonly known as the suede bolete or the yellow-brown bolete. It is a mycorrhizal fungus that forms symbiotic relationships with the roots of various coniferous trees, particularly pine trees.\n\nThe cap of Suillus subalutaceus is typically convex to flat, ranging in color from yellowish-brown to reddish-brown, with a smooth or slightly tacky texture. The pore surface is yellow to olive-yellow, and the tubes are adnate (attached to the stem) or slightly decurrent (running down the stem). The stem is often yellowish, cylindrical, and may have a membranous ring or partial veil remnants. The spore print is olive-brown.\n\nSuillus subalutaceus is found in North America, primarily in areas with pine forests. It is considered an edible mushroom, although caution should be taken as some individuals may have sensitivity or allergic reactions to it. The mushroom can be cooked and consumed, but it is recommended to avoid raw consumption.",
