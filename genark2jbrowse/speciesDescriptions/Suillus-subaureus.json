  "description": "Suillus subaureus is a species of mushroom belonging to the genus Suillus, which is commonly known as the \"slippery jacks\" or \"butter boletes.\" This species is typically found in coniferous forests, particularly in association with pine trees (Pinus spp.).\n\nSuillus subaureus has a convex to flat cap that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The cap surface is sticky or slimy when moist, and can vary in color from yellow to golden-brown. The pore surface beneath the cap is initially white or pale yellow, but can turn olive-brown to brown as the mushroom matures. The stipe (stem) is typically 5-15 cm long and 1-3 cm thick, and may be covered with a partial veil or ring of tissue.\n\nMicroscopically, Suillus subaureus has smooth, elliptical spores that measure 8-12 x 3-5 Î¼m. The spore print is olive-brown to brown. This species is considered edible, but it is not highly prized for its culinary qualities and is often overlooked in favor of other, more sought-after boletes.",
