  "description": "Sus scrofa, commonly known as the wild boar or Eurasian wild pig, is a species of even-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the Suidae family. It is native to much of Eurasia, from Western Europe to the Pacific Ocean, and is the wild ancestor of the domestic pig.\n\nWild boars are typically large, stocky animals with a thick, bristly coat of fur that ranges in color from black to reddish-brown. They have a large, wedge-shaped head, a long, flexible snout, and small, sharp tusks that can be used for defense and foraging. Their legs are relatively short, and they have cloven hooves that are well-adapted for traversing rough terrain.\n\nThese animals are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas. They are omnivorous, feeding on a wide range of plant materials, small animals, and carrion. Wild boars are known for their social behavior, often living in family groups led by a dominant female.\n\nDue to their adaptability and reproductive success, wild boars have become an invasive species in many parts of the world, where they can cause significant damage to agricultural crops and ecosystems. As a result, they are often the subject of conservation efforts and population management strategies.",
