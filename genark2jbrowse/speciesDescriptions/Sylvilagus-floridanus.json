  "description": "Sylvilagus floridanus, commonly known as the Eastern Cottontail, is a species of rabbit native to the eastern and central regions of North America. It is a member of the genus Sylvilagus, which includes several species of small rabbits and hares.\n\nThe Eastern Cottontail is a medium-sized rabbit, typically weighing between 2 to 4 pounds (0.9 to 1.8 kg). It has a distinctive white or grayish-white tail, which resembles a small cotton ball, hence the common name \"cottontail.\" The species' fur coloration ranges from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, with a lighter underside.\n\nThese rabbits are well-adapted to a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and suburban areas. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, forbs, and the bark and twigs of woody plants. The Eastern Cottontail is an important prey species for various predators, such as coyotes, foxes, hawks, and owls.\n\nSylvilagus floridanus is known for its prolific breeding capabilities, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year, each containing 3 to 8 young, known as kits or leverets. The species plays a significant role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for many predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its native range.",
