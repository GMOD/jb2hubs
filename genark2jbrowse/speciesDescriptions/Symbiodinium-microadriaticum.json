  "description": "Symbiodinium microadriaticum is a species of dinoflagellate, a unicellular eukaryotic microorganism, that lives in a symbiotic relationship with various marine invertebrates, such as corals, sea anemones, and some mollusks. This species is a crucial component of coral reef ecosystems, as it provides the host organism with essential nutrients through the process of photosynthesis.\n\nSymbiodinium microadriaticum is a microscopic, spherical or slightly elliptical cell, typically ranging in size from 5 to 15 micrometers in diameter. It possesses a distinct nucleus and chloroplasts, which contain the photosynthetic pigments necessary for its photosynthetic capabilities. The cell wall of S. microadriaticum is composed of cellulose-like material, and it has two flagella that allow for limited movement.\n\nThe symbiotic relationship between S. microadriaticum and its host organism is mutually beneficial. The dinoflagellate provides the host with carbohydrates and other organic compounds produced through photosynthesis, while the host provides the dinoflagellate with a stable, nutrient-rich environment and protection from predators. This symbiosis is essential for the survival and growth of coral reefs, as the dinoflagellates contribute significantly to the overall productivity and resilience of these ecosystems.",
