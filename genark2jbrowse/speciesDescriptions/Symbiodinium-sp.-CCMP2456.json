  "description": "Symbiodinium sp. CCMP2456 is a species of dinoflagellate algae that belongs to the genus Symbiodinium. Dinoflagellates are a group of unicellular eukaryotic organisms that play important roles in marine ecosystems, particularly as primary producers and as symbionts with various marine invertebrates.\n\nSymbiodinium sp. CCMP2456 is a strain of Symbiodinium that was isolated and maintained in culture at the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (CCMP) in the United States. This strain is commonly used in scientific research, particularly in the study of the symbiotic relationship between Symbiodinium and their host organisms, such as reef-building corals.\n\nThe cells of Symbiodinium sp. CCMP2456 are typically spherical or ovoid in shape, with a diameter of approximately 10-15 micrometers. Like other Symbiodinium species, CCMP2456 possesses a complex photosynthetic apparatus and can engage in photosynthesis, producing organic compounds that are essential for the growth and survival of their host organisms.\n\nThe genetic and physiological characteristics of Symbiodinium sp. CCMP2456 have been extensively studied, and this strain has contributed to our understanding of the diversity, ecology, and evolution of Symbiodinium and their role in the health and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.",
