  "description": "Symbiodinium sp. clade C Y103 is a species of single-celled dinoflagellate that commonly forms symbiotic relationships with various marine invertebrates, such as corals, sea anemones, and some mollusks. It is a member of the Symbiodinium genus, which is known for its crucial role in the survival and health of coral reef ecosystems.\n\nClade C is one of the major genetic lineages within the Symbiodinium genus, and the Y103 designation refers to a specific strain or subclade within this clade. Symbiodinium sp. clade C Y103 is typically found in association with various coral species, where it resides within the host's cells and provides essential nutrients and energy through photosynthesis.\n\nThe genetic and physiological characteristics of Symbiodinium sp. clade C Y103 may influence the host's resilience to environmental stressors, such as changes in temperature, light, and nutrient levels. Understanding the distribution, ecology, and functional role of this specific Symbiodinium strain can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of coral reef ecosystems and their response to environmental changes.",
