  "description": "Symsagittifera roscoffensis is a species of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes, which includes flatworms. It is a small, free-living, acoel worm that is found in the intertidal zone of coastal regions, particularly in the Roscoff area of France, from which it derives its specific epithet.\n\nSymsagittifera roscoffensis is unique among acoels in that it harbors a mutualistic relationship with unicellular green algae, which reside within its tissues. These algae, known as zoochlorellae, provide the worm with photosynthetically-derived nutrients, while the worm provides the algae with a protected environment and access to sunlight. This symbiotic relationship allows Symsagittifera roscoffensis to obtain a significant portion of its energy requirements through photosynthesis, rather than relying solely on heterotrophic feeding.\n\nThe worm's body is relatively simple, consisting of a flattened, elongated shape with a single opening that serves as both the mouth and anus. It lacks a defined digestive system, gut, or other complex internal structures, typical of the relatively simple acoel body plan. Symsagittifera roscoffensis exhibits a high degree of regenerative capacity, allowing it to readily repair or replace damaged or lost body parts.\n\nThis species plays a role in the ecology of the intertidal zone, contributing to the cycling of nutrients and energy within the coastal ecosystem. It is also of interest to researchers studying the evolution of symbiotic relationships and the biological mechanisms underlying the integration of different organisms into a functional whole.",
