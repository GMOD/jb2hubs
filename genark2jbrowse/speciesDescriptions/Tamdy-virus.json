  "description": "Tamdy virus is a member of the genus Orthonairoviruses, which belongs to the family Nairoviridae. It is a tick-borne virus that primarily infects rodents and can occasionally infect humans, causing a febrile illness known as Tamdy fever.\n\nThe Tamdy virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome is composed of three segmented RNA strands, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the glycoprotein precursor, and the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).\n\nTamdy virus is primarily transmitted by ticks of the genus Hyalomma, particularly Hyalomma asiaticum, which is the main vector in Central Asia. Rodents, such as gerbils and ground squirrels, serve as the natural reservoir hosts for the virus. Humans can become infected through tick bites or by handling infected animals.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Tamdy fever in humans include fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In severe cases, the infection can lead to complications such as hemorrhage, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure. Treatment is primarily supportive, and no specific antiviral therapy or vaccine is currently available for Tamdy virus infection.\n\nSurveillance, vector control, and public health education are essential for the prevention and management of Tamdy fever in regions where the virus is endemic.",
