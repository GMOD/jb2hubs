  "description": "Tautogolabrus adspersus, commonly known as the cunner, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Labridae (wrasses). It is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Newfoundland, Canada, to North Carolina, United States.\n\nThe cunner is a small, stout-bodied fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 25 centimeters (10 inches). It has a rounded, compressed body shape and a small, terminal mouth with a protruding lower jaw. The body is covered in scales and can vary in color, ranging from olive-green to brownish-red, with occasional blue or yellow markings.\n\nCunners are found in coastal habitats, such as rocky shores, breakwaters, and submerged structures, where they can seek shelter and feed on a variety of small invertebrates, including crustaceans, mollusks, and small fish. They are known to be relatively sedentary and territorial, often forming small social groups.\n\nReproduction in cunners occurs during the summer months, with females spawning multiple times throughout the season. The fertilized eggs hatch into pelagic larvae, which eventually settle to the seafloor and develop into juvenile and adult fish.\n\nCunners are an important component of the coastal ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. They are also of some commercial and recreational interest, though their small size and limited distribution make them a relatively minor fishery.",
