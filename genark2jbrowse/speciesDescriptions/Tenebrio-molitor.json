  "description": "Tenebrio molitor, commonly known as the mealworm, is a species of darkling beetle that belongs to the family Tenebrionidae. It is a widely distributed insect found in various parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nTenebrio molitor is an holometabolous insect, meaning it undergoes complete metamorphosis, transitioning through the stages of egg, larva, pupa, and finally, the adult beetle. The larval stage, often referred to as the mealworm, is the most well-known and commonly utilized form of this species.\n\nMealworms are cylindrical, elongated, and typically yellowish-brown in color. They have a segmented body and a hard exoskeleton. As they grow, they periodically shed their exoskeleton, a process known as molting, until they reach the pupal stage.\n\nTenebrio molitor is known for its adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a popular choice for various applications, including as a food source for pet reptiles, birds, and fish, as well as for use in biomedical research and as a potential source of sustainable protein for human consumption.",
