  "description": "Tetraodon nigroviridis, commonly known as the green-spotted pufferfish or the spotted green pufferfish, is a species of freshwater pufferfish native to Southeast Asia. This fish belongs to the family Tetraodontidae and the order Tetraodontiformes.\n\nThe Tetraodon nigroviridis is a small, disc-shaped fish that can grow up to 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) in length. It has a distinctive green and black mottled pattern on its back and sides, which helps it camouflage in its natural habitat. The fish's body is covered with small, bony plates that can puff up when the fish is threatened, making it appear larger and more intimidating.\n\nThe Tetraodon nigroviridis is a carnivorous fish that feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and mollusks. It has a powerful beak-like jaw that it uses to crush the shells of its prey. The fish is found in slow-moving rivers, lakes, and swamps throughout Southeast Asia, where it plays an important role in the local ecosystem.\n\nDue to its unique appearance and behavior, the Tetraodon nigroviridis is a popular aquarium fish, though it requires specialized care and handling due to its toxicity. The fish's internal organs and skin contain a powerful neurotoxin called tetrodontoxin, which can be dangerous to humans if ingested.",
