  "description": "Tetraselmis striata is a species of green microalgae belonging to the genus Tetraselmis. It is a single-celled, eukaryotic organism that typically measures between 10-20 micrometers in diameter.\n\nThe key features of Tetraselmis striata are:\n\n1. Cell Structure: It has a characteristic tetragonal or quadrangular shape, with four flagella emerging from the anterior end of the cell. The cell is surrounded by a distinct cell wall.\n\n2. Pigmentation: The cells contain chloroplasts, which give them a distinctive green coloration due to the presence of chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments.\n\n3. Striations: As the species name \"striata\" suggests, the cell surface exhibits distinct longitudinal striations or ridges, which is a distinctive morphological feature of this species.\n\n4. Motility: The four flagella allow the cells to swim in a characteristic spinning or rotating motion, enabling them to navigate their aquatic environments.\n\n5. Habitat and Ecology: Tetraselmis striata is commonly found in marine and brackish water environments, where it plays a role in primary production as a photosynthetic organism. It is often used in aquaculture and biotechnology applications due to its nutritional value and ability to thrive in various culture conditions.\n\nOverall, Tetraselmis striata is a well-studied green microalgal species with a unique cell morphology and important ecological and commercial applications.",
