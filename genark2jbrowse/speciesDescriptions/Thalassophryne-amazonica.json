  "description": "Thalassophryne amazonica is a species of venomous marine catfish found in the Amazon River basin and coastal regions of northern Brazil. It belongs to the family Thalassophryneidae, which are known for their unique venom delivery system.\n\nThe key features of Thalassophryne amazonica are:\n\n1. Morphology: It has a flattened, elongated body shape typical of bottom-dwelling catfish. The head is large and broad, with a terminal mouth and prominent bony ridges above the eyes.\n\n2. Venom apparatus: Like other members of its family, T. amazonica possesses hollow, venom-conducting spines on its dorsal and pectoral fins. These spines are connected to venom glands, allowing the fish to inject venom when threatened or disturbed.\n\n3. Habitat and distribution: This species is found in the Amazon River and its tributaries, as well as in coastal estuaries and lagoons of northern Brazil. It prefers calm, muddy or sandy bottom habitats.\n\n4. Ecology and behavior: T. amazonica is a nocturnal, bottom-dwelling predator that feeds on small fishes, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms. Its venom is considered potentially dangerous to humans, causing intense pain and other symptoms upon envenomation.\n\nThis species is an important component of the unique freshwater and estuarine ecosystems of the Amazon basin, highlighting the diversity and adaptations of the region's ichthyofauna.",
