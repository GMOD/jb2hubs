  "description": "Theileria equi strain WA is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Theileria and is responsible for causing equine piroplasmosis, a serious and potentially fatal disease in horses, donkeys, and mules. This particular strain was isolated from Western Australia.\n\nTheileria equi is a tick-borne parasite that is transmitted by various species of Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma ticks. The parasite infects and replicates within the red blood cells of the host, leading to the destruction of these cells and the manifestation of clinical signs such as fever, anemia, jaundice, and lethargy.\n\nThe Theileria equi strain WA is characterized by its genetic and phenotypic variations compared to other Theileria equi strains found in different geographical regions. These variations may influence the parasite's virulence, host specificity, and response to treatment, making it important to understand the specific characteristics of this strain for effective disease management and control.",
