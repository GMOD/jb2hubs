  "description": "Theropithecus gelada, commonly known as the gelada or the bleeding-heart monkey, is a species of Old World monkey found in the high-altitude grasslands of the Ethiopian Highlands. Belonging to the family Cercopithecidae, the gelada is the only living member of the genus Theropithecus.\n\nGeladas are medium-sized primates, with adults typically weighing between 10 to 20 kilograms. They are characterized by their distinctive reddish-pink chest patch, which is more prominent in males and is believed to play a role in social and reproductive behaviors. Geladas have a unique dental adaptation, with their large, protruding incisors used for grazing on grasses and other vegetation.\n\nThese primates are highly social, living in large troops that can number up to several hundred individuals. They exhibit a complex social structure, with hierarchical relationships and specialized roles within the group. Geladas are known for their unique vocalization, including loud barks and grunts, which are used for communication and social interaction.\n\nTheropithecus gelada is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but their populations have faced threats from habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities, such as agriculture and livestock grazing. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas, are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique and fascinating primate species.",
