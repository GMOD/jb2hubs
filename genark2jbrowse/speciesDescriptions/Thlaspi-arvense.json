  "description": "Thlaspi arvense, commonly known as field pennycress or stinkweed, is an annual herbaceous plant species belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is native to Europe and Asia, and has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America.\n\nThlaspi arvense is a winter annual or biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 15-60 cm. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and stem leaves that are oblong to lanceolate in shape, with a wavy or toothed margin. The flowers are small, with four white petals, and are arranged in terminal racemes.\n\nThe fruits of Thlaspi arvense are flattened, heart-shaped silicles (small, dry, dehiscent fruits) that contain several small, brown to black, rounded seeds. The seeds are known for their distinctive, pungent odor, which has contributed to the common name \"stinkweed.\"\n\nThlaspi arvense is considered a weed in many agricultural systems, as it can compete with crops for resources and reduce yields. However, the plant has also been used for various purposes, such as in traditional medicine and as a potential source of oil for biofuel production.",
