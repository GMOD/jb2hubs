  "description": "Thogotovirus dhoriense is a virus species classified within the genus Thogotovirus, which belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The genome of Thogotovirus dhoriense consists of six to eight segments of RNA, which encode the viral proteins necessary for its replication and assembly.\n\nThogotovirus dhoriense was first isolated from ticks collected in the Dhor region of Pakistan. It is known to be transmitted by tick vectors and has been found to infect a range of vertebrate hosts, including various mammalian species. The virus is considered to be a potential threat to public health, as it has been associated with occasional cases of human illness, such as febrile illness and neurological complications.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, host range, and pathogenic potential of Thogotovirus dhoriense. Ongoing surveillance and investigation of this virus species are crucial to assess its impact on human and animal health.",
