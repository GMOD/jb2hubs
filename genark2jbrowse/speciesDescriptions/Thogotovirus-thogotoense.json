  "description": "Thogotovirus thogotoense is a species of virus belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It is a segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks. The virus was first isolated from Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks collected in the Thogoto forest in Kenya.\n\nThogotovirus thogotoense has a genome consisting of six to eight RNA segments, which encode proteins essential for viral replication and assembly. The virus is capable of infecting a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, causing a disease known as Thogoto virus infection. Symptoms can range from mild febrile illness to more severe neurological complications.\n\nThe virus is classified within the Thogotovirus genus, which includes several other tick-borne orthomyxoviruses. Thogotovirus thogotoense is considered a zoonotic pathogen, as it can be transmitted from its natural tick reservoir to humans, posing a potential public health concern in areas where the virus is endemic.",
