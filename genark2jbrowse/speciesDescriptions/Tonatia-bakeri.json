  "description": "Tonatia bakeri, also known as Baker's round-eared bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in Central and South America, primarily in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n\nThe Tonatia bakeri is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of approximately 6-7 inches (15-18 cm) and a wingspan of around 13-15 inches (33-38 cm). It has a distinctive round-shaped head and large, round ears, which are characteristic of the genus Tonatia. The fur of the Tonatia bakeri is generally dark brown or reddish-brown in color, and its wings are membranous and hairless.\n\nThis species is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, including moths, beetles, and flies. They are known to roost in caves, hollow trees, and abandoned buildings, and they are often found in forested habitats.\n\nThe Tonatia bakeri is considered a relatively common species within its range, and it is not currently listed as threatened or endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, like many bat species, it may face threats from habitat loss, deforestation, and disturbance of its roosting sites.",
