  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 10 (TTMDVl0) is a member of the Anelloviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA viruses. The TTMDVl0 genome is approximately 3.2 kilobases in size and encodes for several proteins, including the viral capsid protein.\n\nAnelloviruses, including TTMDVl0, are commonly found in the human population and are thought to be relatively ubiquitous, with a high prevalence of infection. However, the exact mode of transmission and the potential clinical significance of TTMDVl0 infection are not yet fully understood.\n\nWhile the role of TTMDVl0 in human health and disease is still under investigation, the study of this and other anelloviruses continues to provide insights into the diversity and potential impact of these widespread viral agents.",
