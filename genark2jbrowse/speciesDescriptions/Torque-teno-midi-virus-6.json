  "description": "Torque teno midi virus 6 (TTMV6) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. Anelloviruses are a group of ubiquitous viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nTTMV6 is a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family. The viral genome of TTMV6 is approximately 3.2 kilobases in length and encodes three main open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of various viral proteins.\n\nLike other anelloviruses, TTMV6 is believed to be a commensal virus, meaning it is commonly found in the human population without causing any overt disease symptoms. However, the exact role and potential pathogenicity of TTMV6 in human health are still under investigation.\n\nThe prevalence and distribution of TTMV6 in the human population, as well as its potential interactions with the host immune system, are active areas of research. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of TTMV6 and other anelloviruses may provide insights into their potential impact on human health and disease.",
