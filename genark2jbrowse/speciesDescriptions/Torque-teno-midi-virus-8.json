  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 8 (TTMV8) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus is classified as a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family.\n\nTTMV8 has a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA genome that is approximately 3.2 to 3.4 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes for several open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of various viral proteins, including the viral capsid and non-structural proteins.\n\nThe Torque teno midi viruses, including TTMV8, are widely distributed in the human population and can be found in various human tissues and bodily fluids. These viruses are considered to be ubiquitous, with high prevalence rates in healthy individuals, suggesting that they may be part of the normal human virome.\n\nThe exact role and clinical significance of TTMV8 in human health and disease are not yet fully understood. Some studies have suggested potential associations between Torque teno midi virus infections and certain medical conditions, but further research is needed to elucidate the precise biological functions and potential pathogenic mechanisms of these viruses.",
