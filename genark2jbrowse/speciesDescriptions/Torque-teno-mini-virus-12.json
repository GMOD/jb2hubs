  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 12 (TTMiV-12) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Anelloviridae. It is classified as a member of the genus Betatorquevirus, which includes various species of Torque teno mini viruses.\n\nTTMiV-12 is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it lacks an outer lipid membrane. The viral genome is a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA molecule, approximately 2.8 kilobases in size. The genome encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of viral proteins, including those involved in viral replication and particle assembly.\n\nTorque teno mini viruses, including TTMiV-12, are widely distributed in the human population and can be found in various body fluids and tissues. The precise pathogenic role of these viruses in human health is still under investigation, as they are often detected in both healthy individuals and those with various medical conditions.\n\nThe ecological significance and potential implications of TTMiV-12 and other Torque teno mini viruses in human health and disease are the subject of ongoing research, as scientists continue to explore the diversity and interactions of these ubiquitous viral agents within the human virome.",
