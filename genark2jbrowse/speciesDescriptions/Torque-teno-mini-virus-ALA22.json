  "description": "Torque teno mini virus ALA22 is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. It is a member of the Betatorquevirus genus, which is known to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe Torque teno mini virus ALA22 has a circular genome, typically ranging from 2.6 to 3.8 kilobases in size. The viral genome encodes several proteins, including the viral capsid protein, which is responsible for the packaging and protection of the viral genetic material.\n\nThis virus is considered a small DNA virus due to its compact genome size, and it is known to have a high mutation rate, which allows it to adapt to different host environments. Torque teno mini virus ALA22 is believed to be a common and widespread virus, with a global distribution, and it is often found as a commensal or opportunistic pathogen in various human and animal populations.\n\nThe precise role and impact of Torque teno mini virus ALA22 on its host organisms are still being investigated, as the virus is not known to cause any specific diseases. However, it is an important subject of study in the field of virology and microbiology, as it provides insights into the diversity and evolution of viral species and their interactions with their hosts.",
