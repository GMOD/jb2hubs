  "description": "Torque teno mini virus ALH8 is a small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. It is classified as a Torque teno mini virus, a subgenus within the Anellovirus genus.\n\nThe Torque teno mini virus ALH8 has a genome size of approximately 2.9 kilobases and is known to infect various mammalian species, including humans. The virus is primarily found in the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal system of its hosts.\n\nStructurally, the Torque teno mini virus ALH8 is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral capsid. The viral genome encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to be involved in viral replication, assembly, and host interaction.\n\nThe prevalence and significance of Torque teno mini virus ALH8 in human and animal health are still under investigation. However, this virus is often detected in association with various clinical conditions, and its potential role in modulating the host immune response or contributing to disease progression is an active area of research.",
