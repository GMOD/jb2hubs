  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus SHA (TTMV SHA) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus is a member of the Betatorquevirus genus and is considered a type of Torque teno mini virus (TTMV).\n\nThe TTMV SHA genome is a single-stranded, circular DNA molecule that is approximately 2.8 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes a limited number of proteins, including those involved in viral replication and packaging.\n\nTTMV SHA is widely distributed in the human population and is thought to be a common, persistent infection. The virus is primarily detected in human blood and respiratory samples, suggesting it may establish latent infections in various tissues and cell types.\n\nThe clinical significance of TTMV SHA infection is not fully understood, as the virus is often found in healthy individuals without causing overt disease. However, some studies have suggested potential associations between TTMV infection and certain medical conditions, such as liver disease and immune system disorders, though more research is needed to clarify these relationships.\n\nOverall, the Torque teno mini virus SHA represents a member of the diverse Anelloviridae family, which continues to be an active area of research in the field of human virology.",
