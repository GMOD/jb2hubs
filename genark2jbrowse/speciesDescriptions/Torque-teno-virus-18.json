  "description": "Torque teno virus 18 (TTV-18) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Alphatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. The virus particle is approximately 30-50 nanometers in diameter and has a circular, negative-sense genomic DNA of around 3.8 kilobases in length.\n\nTTV-18 is classified as a member of the Torque teno virus (TTV) group, which is a diverse and ubiquitous group of viruses that have been detected in a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. TTV-18 is one of the numerous TTV genotypes that have been identified in the human population, with a global distribution.\n\nThe genome of TTV-18 encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to be involved in viral replication and potential interactions with the host's cellular machinery. However, the exact mechanisms of TTV-18 infection, replication, and potential pathogenic effects in humans are not fully understood, as the clinical significance of TTV-18 infection remains a topic of ongoing research and investigation.",
