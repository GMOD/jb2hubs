  "description": "Torque teno virus 21 (TTV21) is a small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Iotatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. This virus was first discovered in 2016 and is considered a member of the diverse Torque teno virus (TTV) group, which includes numerous virus species that are commonly found in the human population.\n\nTTV21 is non-enveloped, meaning it lacks an outer lipid membrane, and its genome is approximately 3.2 kilobases in size. The virus is believed to primarily infect human cells, particularly cells of the immune system, and can establish persistent, lifelong infections in the host.\n\nThe prevalence and clinical significance of TTV21 infection in humans are not yet fully understood. As with other TTV species, the infection is often asymptomatic, and the virus may be present in both healthy individuals and those with various underlying medical conditions. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of TTV21 in human health and disease.",
