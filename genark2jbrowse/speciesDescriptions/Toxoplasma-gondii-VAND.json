  "description": "Toxoplasma gondii VAND is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It is an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning it can only replicate within the cells of a host organism.\n\nThe VAND strain of T. gondii is a specific genetic lineage or genotype of the parasite. This particular strain was isolated from a human case of toxoplasmosis in the United States.\n\nT. gondii VAND is capable of infecting a wide range of warm-blooded animals, including humans, as its definitive host. The parasite can cause the disease toxoplasmosis, which can lead to various health problems, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems or during pregnancy.\n\nThe VAND strain of T. gondii exhibits genetic variations that may influence its pathogenicity, host preferences, and response to certain antiparasitic treatments compared to other genotypes of the parasite. Understanding the characteristics of this specific strain contributes to the overall knowledge of T. gondii's biology and the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis.",
