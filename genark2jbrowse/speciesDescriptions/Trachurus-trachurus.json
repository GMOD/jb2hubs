  "description": "Trachurus trachurus, commonly known as the Atlantic horse mackerel or scad, is a species of small migratory marine fish belonging to the family Carangidae. It is widely distributed in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Norway to South Africa, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.\n\nThe Atlantic horse mackerel is a pelagic, schooling fish that typically grows to a length of around 30 cm. It has a streamlined, fusiform body with a slender, silvery-grey coloration that helps camouflage it in the open ocean. The fish has a series of scutes (bony plates) along its lateral line, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Trachurus.\n\nThis species plays an important role in marine ecosystems, serving as a prey item for various predatory fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. It is also a commercially important species, with significant fisheries targeting the Atlantic horse mackerel for human consumption and use as bait.\n\nThe life cycle of Trachurus trachurus involves spawning in offshore waters, with the pelagic eggs and larvae eventually drifting towards coastal areas where the juveniles grow and mature. The species is known to undertake extensive migrations, often following the seasonal movements of their prey, such as small crustaceans and other small fish.",
