  "description": "Trachypithecus phayrei crepuscula is a subspecies of the Phayre's leaf monkey, a primate species belonging to the genus Trachypithecus. It is a medium-sized Old World monkey found in the forests of northeast India and Bangladesh.\n\nThe Trachypithecus phayrei crepuscula is characterized by its distinctive fur coloration, which ranges from grayish-brown to reddish-brown. It has a black face with white markings around the eyes and a long, prehensile tail that it uses for balance and movement through the arboreal environment.\n\nThese leaf monkeys are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of leaves, fruits, and flowers found in their forest habitat. They live in social groups and exhibit complex social behaviors, including vocalizations, grooming, and territoriality.\n\nThe subspecies Trachypithecus phayrei crepuscula is found in the eastern parts of the Trachypithecus phayrei range, specifically in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region of Bangladesh and the adjacent areas of northeast India. They are considered a threatened subspecies due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting pressures in some areas.",
