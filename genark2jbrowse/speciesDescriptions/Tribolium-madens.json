  "description": "Tribolium madens, also known as the dark mealworm beetle, is a species of beetle belonging to the family Tenebrionidae. It is a small, dark-colored insect that is commonly found in stored grain and cereal products.\n\nThe Tribolium madens beetle is about 4-6 millimeters in length and has a flattened, oval-shaped body. Its color varies from reddish-brown to dark brown or black. The antennae are relatively short, and the legs are adapted for crawling.\n\nTribolium madens is known to be a pest of stored products, where it can cause significant damage by feeding on grains, flour, and other dry, starchy foods. The larvae, or \"mealworms,\" are also capable of consuming these stored products, further contributing to the economic impact of this pest.\n\nThe life cycle of Tribolium madens typically involves egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The females lay their eggs in cracks and crevices near food sources, and the larvae hatch and begin feeding on the available resources. After the larval stage, the insects undergo a pupal transformation before emerging as adult beetles.\n\nTribolium madens is widely distributed across the world, particularly in areas with warm and humid climates. It is considered a cosmopolitan pest, found in many regions where stored food products are present.",
