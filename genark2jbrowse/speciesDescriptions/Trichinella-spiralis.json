  "description": "Trichinella spiralis is a parasitic nematode (roundworm) that infects both humans and animals. It is the causative agent of the disease known as trichinosis or trichinellosis.\n\nThe life cycle of T. spiralis involves two distinct stages: the intestinal stage and the muscle stage. The adult worms reside in the small intestine of the host, where they mate and release larvae that migrate through the body and encyst within skeletal muscle fibers. When the infected muscle tissue is consumed by another host, the larvae are released and mature into adult worms in the new host's intestine, completing the cycle.\n\nT. spiralis is primarily transmitted through the consumption of undercooked or raw meat, particularly pork and wild game, that contains encysted larvae. Upon ingestion, the larvae are released, mature into adults, and reproduce, leading to the subsequent release of new larvae that can infect the host's muscles.\n\nInfection with T. spiralis can cause a range of symptoms, including gastrointestinal issues, muscle pain, fever, and in severe cases, potentially life-threatening complications. Proper cooking of meat and thorough inspection of meat products are essential preventive measures against trichinosis.",
