  "description": "Trichoderma harzianum CBS 226.95 is a filamentous fungal species that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum and the Hypocreales order. It is a widely studied and used biocontrol agent due to its ability to inhibit the growth of various plant pathogens.\n\nThis particular strain, CBS 226.95, was isolated and deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection in the Netherlands. It is known for its efficient production of hydrolytic enzymes, such as cellulases and chitinases, which play a crucial role in its antagonistic activity against other fungi.\n\nTrichoderma harzianum CBS 226.95 is a fast-growing, green-colored fungus that produces abundant spores, known as conidia, which aid in its rapid dispersal and colonization of various substrates. It is commonly found in soil and is known for its ability to promote plant growth and enhance plant resistance to diseases.\n\nThe strain's versatility and effectiveness in controlling a wide range of plant pathogens have made it a valuable asset in sustainable agriculture and integrated pest management strategies.",
