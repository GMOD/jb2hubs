  "description": "Trichophyton equinum CBS 127.97 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Trichophyton. Trichophyton species are commonly known as dermatophytes, which are a group of fungi that can infect the skin, hair, and nails of humans and animals.\n\nTrichophyton equinum is a specific strain of the Trichophyton equinum species, and the CBS 127.97 designation indicates that it was isolated and deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection.\n\nTrichophyton equinum is primarily associated with causing infections in horses, but it can also infect other equine species, such as donkeys and mules. The fungus typically colonizes the skin and hair of the infected animal, leading to the development of circular, scaly lesions. In some cases, Trichophyton equinum infections can also occur in humans who have close contact with infected animals.\n\nTaxonomically, Trichophyton equinum belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Eurotiomycetes, and order Onygenales. The species is known to produce characteristic microscopic features, such as septate hyphae and microconidia, which are used for its identification and differentiation from other Trichophyton species.",
