It is a widely distributed pest found in various parts of the world, including North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe adult Trichoplusia ni moth has a wingspan of approximately 30-40 mm. The forewings are grayish-brown in color, with a distinct silver or white \"Y-shaped\" mark near the center. The hindwings are pale grayish-brown.\n\nThe larvae, or caterpillars, of Trichoplusia ni are called \"cabbage loopers\" due to their characteristic looping movement as they crawl. The larvae are green in color with a white stripe along each side of their body. They can cause significant damage to a variety of crops, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and other brassicas, by feeding on the leaves and foliage.\n\nTrichoplusia ni undergoes complete metamorphosis, with four distinct life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult moth. The species is known for its ability to migrate long distances, contributing to its widespread distribution and economic importance as an agricultural pest.",
