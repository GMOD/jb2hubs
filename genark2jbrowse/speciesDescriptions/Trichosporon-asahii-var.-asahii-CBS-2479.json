  "description": "Trichosporon asahii var. asahii CBS 2479 is a yeast-like fungal species that belongs to the genus Trichosporon. This variety was originally isolated from clinical samples and is known to be an opportunistic pathogen associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nMorphologically, Trichosporon asahii var. asahii CBS 2479 exhibits the following characteristics:\n\n1. Colonies: The colonies are typically white to cream-colored, smooth, and yeast-like in appearance.\n\n2. Cells: The cells are typically spherical to oval-shaped, and may form pseudohyphae or true hyphae.\n\n3. Reproduction: Trichosporon asahii var. asahii CBS 2479 reproduces asexually through the formation of arthroconidia (rectangular, thin-walled cells formed by the fragmentation of hyphae).\n\nPhysiologically, this variety is known to be able to assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources, and can grow at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 40°C.\n\nTrichosporon asahii var. asahii CBS 2479 has been associated with a range of clinical infections, including invasive trichosporonosis, disseminated infections, and fungemia, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematological malignancies, organ transplants, or underlying medical conditions.",
