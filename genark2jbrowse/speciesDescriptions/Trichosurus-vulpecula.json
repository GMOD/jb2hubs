  "description": "Trichosurus vulpecula, commonly known as the common brushtail possum, is a species of arboreal marsupial found in Australia and New Zealand. It is a member of the family Phalangeridae and is one of the most widespread and adaptable marsupial species in Australia.\n\nThe common brushtail possum is a medium-sized animal, typically weighing between 1.5 to 4 kilograms. It has a stocky build, a rounded head, and a long, prehensile tail that it uses for balance and climbing. The fur of the common brushtail possum is typically gray or reddish-brown, with a distinctive pointed snout and large, round ears.\n\nThese possums are primarily nocturnal and arboreal, spending much of their time in the canopy of trees, where they feed on a variety of plant matter, including leaves, flowers, fruits, and bark. They are also known to supplement their diet with small invertebrates, eggs, and even small birds.\n\nThe common brushtail possum is an adaptable species, capable of thriving in a wide range of habitats, including urban and suburban areas. They are known for their ability to exploit human-modified environments and can become a nuisance in some areas due to their tendency to raid gardens and enter homes in search of food.\n\nTrichosurus vulpecula plays an important role in the ecosystems it inhabits, acting as a seed disperser and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. However, the species has also been introduced to New Zealand, where it is considered an invasive pest due to its impact on native flora and fauna.",
