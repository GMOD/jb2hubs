It is one of the most widely cultivated cereal crops in the world, serving as a staple food for a significant portion of the global population.\n\nTriticum aestivum is a diploid organism with a chromosome count of 2n = 42. It is a member of the Triticeae tribe within the Pooideae subfamily, which includes other important cereal crops such as barley (Hordeum) and rye (Secale).\n\nThe plant is characterized by its erect, jointed stems that can reach heights of up to 1.2 meters. The leaves are linear, with a sheath that surrounds the stem. The inflorescence is a spike-like structure, known as a spike, which bears the spikelets that contain the individual florets and ultimately the grains.\n\nTriticum aestivum is widely adaptable to various climatic conditions and is cultivated in diverse regions, from temperate to subtropical areas. It is an important source of carbohydrates, proteins, and various essential nutrients, making it a crucial component of the human diet worldwide.",
