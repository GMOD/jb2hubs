  "description": "Trypanosoma brucei gambiense DAL972 is a subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. The DAL972 strain is a specific isolate of the Trypanosoma brucei gambiense subspecies, which is responsible for the chronic form of the disease found primarily in West and Central Africa.\n\nTrypanosoma brucei gambiense is a unicellular eukaryotic organism that belongs to the order Kinetoplastida. It has a complex life cycle, alternating between its mammalian host, typically humans, and its insect vector, the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.). The parasite's morphology is characterized by a single flagellum, which is used for motility, and a unique organelle called the kinetoplast, which contains the parasite's mitochondrial DNA.\n\nThe DAL972 strain of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense has been widely used in research to study the pathogenesis, host-parasite interactions, and potential treatments for human African trypanosomiasis. Understanding the specific characteristics and behaviors of this strain contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop effective strategies for the control and elimination of this neglected tropical disease.",
