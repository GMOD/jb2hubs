  "description": "Trypanosoma evansi is a species of single-celled parasitic protozoan that belongs to the genus Trypanosoma. It is the causative agent of a disease known as Surra, which primarily affects livestock such as camels, horses, cattle, and water buffaloes, although it can also infect humans.\n\nTrypanosoma evansi is a flagellated parasite that lives and multiplies in the bloodstream of its host. It has a long, slender, and undulating body shape, with a prominent flagellum that extends from the posterior end and aids in its motility. The parasite's surface is covered with a dense glycoprotein coat that helps it evade the host's immune system.\n\nThe life cycle of Trypanosoma evansi involves a biological transmission by various biting insects, such as horseflies, stable flies, and tabanids, which act as vectors. When an infected vector bites a susceptible host, the parasites are introduced into the host's bloodstream, where they can then multiply and cause the characteristic symptoms of Surra.\n\nSurra is a debilitating disease that can lead to significant economic losses in affected livestock populations due to reduced productivity, decreased fertility, and increased mortality rates. In humans, Trypanosoma evansi infections are rare but can occur, particularly in individuals who work closely with infected animals or in areas where the disease is endemic.",
