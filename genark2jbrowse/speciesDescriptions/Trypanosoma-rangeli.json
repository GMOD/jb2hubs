  "description": "Trypanosoma rangeli is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Trypanosoma. It is primarily found in Central and South America, where it infects various mammalian hosts, including humans, wild and domestic animals, and triatomine insects (also known as kissing bugs) that act as vectors.\n\nT. rangeli is a hemoflagellate, meaning it has a flagellum that extends from its cell body and is involved in its locomotion. Unlike the closely related Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the causative agent of Chagas disease, T. rangeli is not considered pathogenic to humans and is generally considered non-pathogenic. However, in some cases, it can cause mild and self-limiting symptoms in infected individuals.\n\nThe life cycle of T. rangeli involves both vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors. The parasite is transmitted to vertebrate hosts, including humans, through the bite of infected triatomine bugs. Inside the vertebrate host, T. rangeli can be found in the bloodstream and various tissues, where it undergoes different developmental stages.\n\nWhile T. rangeli infection is generally asymptomatic in humans, it can be of importance in the diagnosis of Chagas disease, as the two parasites share some serological and molecular similarities. Accurate identification and differentiation of T. rangeli from T. cruzi are crucial for proper disease management and epidemiological surveillance.",
