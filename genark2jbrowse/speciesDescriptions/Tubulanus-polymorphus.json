  "description": "Tubulanus polymorphus is a species of marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Nemertea, also known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms. It is a member of the class Palaeonemertea, which are characterized by a relatively simple body plan and the absence of a specialized proboscis.\n\nTubulanus polymorphus is a small, slender worm, typically ranging from a few centimeters to several decimeters in length. Its body is cylindrical and unsegmented, with a smooth, translucent or whitish appearance. The worm's mouth is located on the ventral (underside) surface, and it lacks a distinct head or eyes.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of T. polymorphus is its ability to undergo significant changes in body shape and size, hence the species name \"polymorphus,\" which means \"many forms.\" This species can contract and elongate its body, as well as display various coiling and burrowing behaviors, which are likely adaptations to its marine environment and predator-prey interactions.\n\nT. polymorphus is found in various marine habitats, such as rocky shores, sandy or muddy seafloors, and among seagrass beds. It plays a role in the local food web, serving as prey for larger predators, while also contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecological functioning of the coastal and shallow-water ecosystems it inhabits.",
