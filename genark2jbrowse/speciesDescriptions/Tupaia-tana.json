  "description": "Tupaia tana, commonly known as the large treeshrew, is a species of treeshrew native to the island of Borneo. Treeshrews are small, agile mammals that belong to the order Scandentia and are closely related to primates.\n\nThe large treeshrew is a medium-sized treeshrew, measuring approximately 30-35 cm in length, including the tail. It has a slender, elongated body, a pointed snout, and large, round eyes. The fur is soft and dense, typically reddish-brown or grayish-brown in color, with a paler underside.\n\nTupaia tana is an arboreal species, primarily inhabiting tropical rainforests and dense vegetation. It is an active, diurnal animal, known for its agility and ability to move quickly through the trees. The large treeshrew is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of insects, small vertebrates, fruits, and nectar.\n\nReproduction in the large treeshrew is relatively well-studied. Females typically give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of around 45-50 days. The young are born relatively underdeveloped and require parental care for several weeks before becoming independent.\n\nThe large treeshrew is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is generally adaptable to habitat changes. However, like many other species in Borneo, it faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities.",
