  "description": "Tyto alba alba, commonly known as the common barn owl or the western barn owl, is a subspecies of the barn owl (Tyto alba) that is found across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. This nocturnal raptor is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped facial disc, large dark eyes, and soft, pale plumage that can range from white to light brown.\n\nThe common barn owl is a medium-sized owl, typically measuring between 32-39 cm in length and weighing around 250-500 grams. It is an efficient hunter, relying on its acute hearing and vision to locate small rodents, such as voles, mice, and shrews, which make up the majority of its diet.\n\nTyto alba alba is known for its silent flight, which is facilitated by its specialized feathers that reduce noise during flight. This adaptation allows the owl to approach its prey without alerting it, increasing the chances of a successful hunt.\n\nThe common barn owl is a cavity-nesting species, often taking up residence in abandoned buildings, barns, or tree cavities. It is a monogamous species, with pairs typically forming long-term breeding relationships. The female lays a clutch of 2-6 eggs, which she incubates for approximately 30-34 days.\n\nThe common barn owl is widely distributed and considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, population declines have been observed in some regions due to factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and persecution.",
