  "description": "Ursus arctos horribilis, commonly known as the grizzly bear, is a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) found in North America. Some key scientific characteristics of this species include:\n\n1. Morphology: Grizzly bears are large, powerful mammals with a distinctive hump on their shoulders, a concave facial profile, and rounded ears. They have thick, shaggy fur that can range in color from blonde to nearly black, often with a distinctive \"grizzled\" appearance.\n\n2. Size: Grizzly bears are among the largest terrestrial carnivores in North America, with adult males typically weighing between 400 to 800 pounds (180 to 360 kg) and standing up to 3.5 feet (1.1 m) tall at the shoulder.\n\n3. Habitat and Distribution: Grizzly bears are found in western North America, primarily in Alaska, western Canada, and the northwestern United States, including parts of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Washington.\n\n4. Diet: Grizzly bears are omnivores, with a diet that includes a wide variety of plant matter, such as berries, roots, and grasses, as well as animal prey, including fish, small mammals, and carrion.\n\n5. Behavior and Ecology: Grizzly bears are known for their strength, intelligence, and adaptability. They are solitary animals, with male and female bears coming together primarily for mating. Grizzly bears are also known for their ability to hibernate during the winter months.\n\n6. Conservation Status: Grizzly bears were once widespread in North America, but their populations have declined due to habitat loss, hunting, and conflicts with humans. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service currently lists the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states, with ongoing efforts to protect and manage their populations.",
