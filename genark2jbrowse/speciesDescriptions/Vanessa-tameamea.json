  "description": "Vanessa tameamea, commonly known as the Kamehameha butterfly, is a species of brush-footed butterfly native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the genus Vanessa, which includes several species of butterflies commonly referred to as \"Admirals.\"\n\nThe Kamehameha butterfly is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 6-8 centimeters. Its wings are primarily dark brown or black in color, with distinctive orange-red patches and white spots. The hindwings often have a row of blue spots near the outer edge.\n\nThis species is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands and is found on several of the main islands, including Hawaii, Maui, and Oahu. It inhabits a variety of habitats, from coastal areas to montane forests, and can be observed feeding on the nectar of various native and introduced plant species.\n\nThe Kamehameha butterfly plays an important role in the Hawaiian ecosystem, serving as a pollinator and contributing to the diversity of the native flora and fauna. Its conservation status is currently classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it faces threats from habitat loss and the introduction of non-native predators and competitors.",
