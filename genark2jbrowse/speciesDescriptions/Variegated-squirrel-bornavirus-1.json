  "description": "The Variegated Squirrel Bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1) is a newly discovered member of the Bornaviridae family of viruses. It was first identified in 2015 after being isolated from the brains of variegated squirrels (Sciurus variegatoides) in Germany.\n\nVSBV-1 is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Orthobornavirus. It is closely related to the more well-known Borna disease virus, which is known to infect a variety of mammalian species, including horses, sheep, and humans.\n\nGenomic analysis has shown that VSBV-1 has a unique genetic profile that distinguishes it from other known bornaviruses. It is believed to have a natural reservoir in the variegated squirrel population, though the full extent of its host range and potential for zoonotic transmission to humans is still under investigation.\n\nInfection with VSBV-1 in humans has been associated with severe neurological disorders, including fatal encephalitis. However, more research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical implications of this newly emerging viral pathogen.",
