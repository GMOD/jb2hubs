  "description": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. It is a zoonotic virus, primarily maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving mosquitoes and rodents or equine species.\n\nVEEV is classified into several subtypes and variants, with the IC and ID subtypes being the most common and responsible for major outbreaks in humans and equines. The virus is capable of causing a severe, potentially fatal neurological disease known as Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) in both humans and horses.\n\nInfection with VEEV can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and in some cases, neurological complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, and long-term neurological sequelae. The virus can be transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes or by direct contact with infected animals.\n\nVEEV is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Venezuela, Colombia, Central America, and parts of the United States. It poses a significant public health concern due to its potential for outbreaks, the severity of the disease it can cause, and the lack of widely available effective vaccines or treatments.",
