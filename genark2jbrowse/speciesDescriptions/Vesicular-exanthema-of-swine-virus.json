  "description": "Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) is a member of the genus Calicivirus, which belongs to the family Caliciviridae. It is an RNA virus that primarily infects pigs and can cause a highly contagious disease known as vesicular exanthema of swine.\n\nThe VESV virion is non-enveloped and has an icosahedral capsid structure, with a diameter of approximately 35-40 nanometers. The viral genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes the necessary proteins for viral replication and assembly.\n\nInfection with VESV leads to the development of fluid-filled vesicles, or blisters, on the snout, lips, tongue, and feet of infected pigs. These vesicles can rupture, causing pain and discomfort, and can lead to lameness, reduced appetite, and fever in affected animals.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, as well as through contaminated food, water, or other materials. VESV can also be spread through the movement of people, equipment, or vehicles between infected and non-infected farms.\n\nEffective control and prevention of vesicular exanthema of swine rely on rapid detection, isolation of infected animals, and implementation of strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of the virus. Vaccination and the development of effective treatment strategies are also areas of ongoing research and development.",
