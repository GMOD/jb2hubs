  "description": "Vesicular stomatitis Alagoas virus (VSAV) is a member of the genus Vesiculovirus, which belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects cattle, horses, and other livestock.\n\nVSAV is named after the Alagoas state in Brazil, where it was first isolated in 1993. The virus is closely related to the more well-known Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is responsible for causing vesicular stomatitis, a viral disease characterized by the formation of vesicles (blisters) on the mouth, tongue, lips, and coronary bands of the hooves in affected animals.\n\nLike other Vesiculoviruses, VSAV is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected insects, such as sand flies and black flies. The virus can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated materials. Once inside the host, the virus targets and replicates in the epithelial cells, leading to the development of the characteristic vesicular lesions.\n\nVSAV is considered an emerging pathogen, and its distribution and impact on livestock health are still being studied. Proper biosecurity measures, vector control, and early detection are crucial for preventing and managing outbreaks of this virus in affected regions.",
