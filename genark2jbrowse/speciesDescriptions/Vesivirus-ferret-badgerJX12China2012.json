  "description": "Vesivirus ferret badger/JX12/China/2012 is a virus that was isolated from a ferret badger (Melogale moschata) in China in 2012. It belongs to the genus Vesivirus, which is a member of the family Caliciviridae.\n\nVesiviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The genome of Vesivirus ferret badger/JX12/China/2012 is approximately 8.2 kilobases in length and encodes for several structural and non-structural proteins necessary for its replication and assembly.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that this particular Vesivirus strain is closely related to other Vesivirus strains isolated from various animal species, suggesting a potential for cross-species transmission. However, the specific host range, pathogenicity, and epidemiological significance of this virus strain in ferret badgers and other wildlife populations are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.",
