  "description": "Vespa crabro, commonly known as the European hornet, is a species of large social wasp found throughout Europe and Asia. It belongs to the genus Vespa, which includes the largest species of hornets.\n\nThe European hornet is typically 25-35 mm in length, with a brown and yellow-banded abdomen. They have large, powerful mandibles and a stocky build compared to other wasp species. Vespa crabro nests in hollow trees, wall cavities, or other sheltered areas, constructing a paper-like nest made from chewed wood fibers.\n\nThese hornets are considered beneficial insects, as they prey on various pest species such as flies, caterpillars, and other insects. However, they can also be aggressive when their nest is threatened, and their sting is considered more painful than that of honeybees.\n\nThe European hornet plays an important ecological role as a predator and pollinator, contributing to the overall biodiversity of the regions where it is found. Its biology and behavior have been the subject of extensive research in the field of entomology.",
