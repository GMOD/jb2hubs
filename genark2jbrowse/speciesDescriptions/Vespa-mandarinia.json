  "description": "Vespa mandarinia, commonly known as the Asian giant hornet or the murder hornet, is a species of hornet native to the forests and mountains of East Asia. It is the largest known hornet species in the world, with workers measuring up to 45 millimeters (1.8 inches) in length and having a wingspan of up to 75 millimeters (3.0 inches).\n\nVespa mandarinia is a highly aggressive predator, known for its potent venom and the ability to attack in coordinated swarms. The venom contains a potent neurotoxin that can cause severe pain, swelling, and, in rare cases, even death in humans. The hornet's large mandibles are capable of tearing through the exoskeletons of other insects, including honey bees, which it preys upon to feed its larvae.\n\nThe Asian giant hornet is considered a significant threat to honey bee populations, as it can decimate entire hives in a matter of hours. Its introduction to North America has raised concerns about the potential impact on local bee populations and the challenges associated with controlling this invasive species.",
