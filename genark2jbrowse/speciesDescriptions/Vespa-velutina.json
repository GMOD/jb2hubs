Habitat and Distribution:\n   - Native to East Asia, including China, India, and Vietnam\n   - Introduced and invasive species in Europe, including France, Spain, and Portugal\n\n4. Behavior and Ecology:\n   - Social, living in colonies with a single queen and thousands of workers\n   - Predatory, feeding on a variety of insects, including honeybees, and small vertebrates\n   - Aggressive defense of the nest, capable of stinging humans\n   - Considered a threat to European honeybee populations and biodiversity\n\n5. Nesting and Reproduction:\n   - Constructs large, hanging nests in trees, shrubs, or man-made structures\n   - Queen establishes a new colony each spring, laying eggs that develop into workers, drones, and new queens\n\nVespa velutina is an invasive species that has spread rapidly in Europe, posing a threat to local ecosystems and beekeeping industries. Its aggressive behavior and predatory nature make it an important subject of ecological and entomological research.",
