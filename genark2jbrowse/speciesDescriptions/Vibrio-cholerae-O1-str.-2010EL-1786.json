  "description": "Vibrio cholerae O1 str. 2010EL-1786 is a bacterial strain of the species Vibrio cholerae, which is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease cholera. This particular strain was isolated during a cholera outbreak in Haiti in 2010.\n\nVibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the family Vibrionaceae. The O1 serogroup is one of the two main serogroups (O1 and O139) that are known to cause epidemic cholera. The strain 2010EL-1786 is a member of the El Tor biotype, which is the predominant biotype causing cholera epidemics worldwide.\n\nGenomic analysis of this strain has revealed the presence of virulence factors, such as the cholera toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus, which are essential for the pathogenicity of V. cholerae. The strain also carries genetic determinants for antibiotic resistance, which can complicate the treatment of cholera.\n\nUnderstanding the characteristics of this specific strain of V. cholerae is important for monitoring the evolution of the pathogen, developing effective diagnostic tools, and improving public health strategies to control and prevent cholera outbreaks.",
