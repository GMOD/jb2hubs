  "description": "Vicia villosa, commonly known as hairy vetch or winter vetch, is a legume species that belongs to the genus Vicia in the pea family, Fabaceae. It is a trailing or climbing annual or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and Asia.\n\nThe plant has a trailing or climbing growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The leaves are pinnately compound, with 8-12 pairs of leaflets that are oblong or linear in shape. The flowers are small, pea-like, and typically purple or white in color, occurring in axillary clusters.\n\nVicia villosa is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it a valuable cover crop and green manure plant, often used to improve soil fertility and structure in agricultural systems. It is also used as a forage crop for livestock and as a source of nectar for pollinators.\n\nThe plant's hairy, pubescent appearance and its ability to fix nitrogen have made it a widely cultivated and studied species, with applications in both agriculture and ecological restoration.",
