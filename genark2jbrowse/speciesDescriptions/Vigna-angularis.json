  "description": "Vigna angularis, commonly known as adzuki bean or red mung bean, is a species of legume native to East Asia. It is a small, round, reddish-brown bean that is widely cultivated and consumed as a food crop in many parts of Asia, particularly in Japan, China, and Korea.\n\nBotanically, Vigna angularis is an annual herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Fabaceae (legumes). It has a climbing or trailing growth habit, with small, trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that produce the characteristic bean pods. The pods contain a few small, ovoid seeds that are the edible portion of the plant.\n\nAdzuki beans are valued for their high protein content, complex carbohydrates, and various micronutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. They are commonly used in a variety of traditional dishes and desserts, as well as in health food products due to their nutritional profile and potential health benefits.\n\nAgronomically, Vigna angularis is adapted to a wide range of climates and soil conditions, making it a valuable crop for many regions. It is generally cultivated as a summer or autumn crop, with the beans harvested when mature and dried for storage and consumption.",
