  "description": "Vipera latastei, commonly known as the Lataste's viper or Iberian viper, is a venomous snake species found in the Iberian Peninsula and parts of northern Africa. It belongs to the genus Vipera, which includes various species of true vipers.\n\nThe Lataste's viper is a small to medium-sized snake, typically measuring between 40 and 70 centimeters in length. It has a stocky, robust body and a distinct triangular-shaped head, which is characteristic of vipers. The snake's coloration can vary, ranging from various shades of brown, gray, or reddish-brown, often with darker blotches or patterns along its back and sides.\n\nVipera latastei is a ground-dwelling species that primarily inhabits rocky, mountainous areas, scrublands, and grasslands. It is a nocturnal or crepuscular snake, meaning it is most active during the night or at dawn and dusk. The Lataste's viper uses its heat-sensing pits, located between its eyes and nostrils, to detect warm-blooded prey, such as small rodents, lizards, and birds.\n\nAs a venomous snake, the Lataste's viper possesses a pair of hollow, retractable fangs that it uses to inject venom into its prey. The venom is a complex mixture of proteins and enzymes that can cause severe pain, swelling, and potentially life-threatening symptoms in humans if bitten. However, the species is not considered to be highly aggressive towards humans and typically only bites in self-defense.\n\nThe Lataste's viper is an important part of the Iberian Peninsula's and North African ecosystems, playing a role in the regulation of small mammal and reptile populations. It is classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but its populations may be threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation in some regions.",
