  "description": "Vipera ursinii, also known as the Orsini's viper or the meadow viper, is a small venomous snake species belonging to the Viperidae family. It is native to various regions in Europe, including parts of France, Italy, Austria, and the Balkans.\n\nThe Orsini's viper is a relatively small snake, typically reaching lengths between 30 to 50 centimeters. It has a slender build and a distinct triangular-shaped head, which is a characteristic feature of most viper species. The coloration of Vipera ursinii can vary, ranging from shades of gray, brown, or reddish-brown, often with darker markings or patterns along the body.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit various types of grasslands, meadows, and alpine habitats, preferring areas with sparse vegetation and rocky outcrops. Orsini's vipers are predominantly terrestrial and rely on camouflage to avoid detection by both predators and prey.\n\nAs a venomous snake, Vipera ursinii possesses a potent hemotoxic venom that can be dangerous to humans. However, the species is generally not considered aggressive and will typically only strike in self-defense when threatened or handled.\n\nDue to habitat loss and fragmentation, the Orsini's viper is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Ongoing conservation efforts aim to protect and preserve the remaining populations of this unique European viper.",
