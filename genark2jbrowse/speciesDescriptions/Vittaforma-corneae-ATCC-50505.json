  "description": "Vittaforma corneae ATCC 50505 is a species of microsporidian, a group of obligate intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of hosts, including humans. This particular strain was isolated from the cornea of a patient with microsporidial keratitis, a rare but serious eye infection.\n\nVittaforma corneae is a small, spore-forming organism that belongs to the phylum Microsporidia. It is characterized by the presence of a unique organelle called the polar tube, which is used to inject the parasite's genetic material into the host cell during the infection process. The spores of V. corneae are oval-shaped and measure approximately 1-2 micrometers in size.\n\nThis species is known to primarily infect the corneal epithelial cells of the eye, leading to the development of microsporidial keratitis, a condition characterized by corneal inflammation, opacity, and vision impairment. Transmission of the infection can occur through direct contact with contaminated water or soil, or through the handling of infected animals.\n\nVittaforma corneae ATCC 50505 is an important model organism for the study of microsporidial infections, as it provides a well-characterized system for investigating the pathogenesis, host-parasite interactions, and potential treatment strategies for this type of opportunistic infection.",
