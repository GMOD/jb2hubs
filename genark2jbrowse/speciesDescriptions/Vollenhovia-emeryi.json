  "description": "Vollenhovia emeryi is a species of ant that belongs to the genus Vollenhovia, which is a part of the subfamily Myrmicinae. The species is native to various regions in Asia, including Japan, China, and Taiwan.\n\nVollenhovia emeryi is a small ant, with workers typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length. The species is characterized by its dark brown or black coloration, with the head, thorax, and abdomen being uniformly dark in appearance. The workers have a relatively large and robust body shape, with a well-developed thorax and a rounded, oval-shaped abdomen.\n\nThe ants live in small colonies, typically nesting in soil, under stones, or in rotten wood. They are known to be omnivorous, feeding on a variety of food sources, including other insects, honeydew, and plant matter.\n\nThe reproductive biology and colony structure of Vollenhovia emeryi are not well-studied, but it is believed that the species exhibits a typical Myrmicine ant colony organization, with a single queen and a division of labor among the workers.\n\nOverall, Vollenhovia emeryi is a common and widely distributed ant species in its native range, contributing to the diversity and ecology of the regions where it is found.",
