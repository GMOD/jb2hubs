  "description": "Vulpes vulpes, commonly known as the red fox, is a widespread and adaptable carnivorous mammal species belonging to the family Canidae. It is the largest of the true foxes and is native to the Northern Hemisphere, with a range that extends across Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nThe red fox is characterized by its distinctive reddish-orange fur, which provides camouflage in its natural habitats, and its bushy tail, known as a \"brush.\" These foxes are typically small to medium-sized, with a slender build and pointed snout. They are known for their remarkable intelligence, adaptability, and opportunistic feeding habits, preying on a wide range of small mammals, birds, insects, and even some plant matter.\n\nRed foxes are typically solitary animals, but they can form family groups during the breeding season. They are skilled hunters, using their keen senses of hearing and smell to locate prey, and their agility to capture it. Their adaptability has allowed them to thrive in a variety of environments, from rural areas to urban settings, making them one of the most widely distributed carnivores in the world.",
