  "description": "WU Polyomavirus (WUPyV) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Polyomaviridae family. It was first discovered in 2007 in respiratory samples collected from children with respiratory tract infections in St. Louis, Missouri, USA.\n\nThe WUPyV genome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule approximately 5 kilobases in size. The virus has a simple genome structure, encoding a small and a large T antigen, as well as the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.\n\nWUPyV is known to infect humans, primarily children, and can be detected in various clinical samples, including respiratory secretions, stool, and blood. The virus is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets or fomites, and it can establish asymptomatic, persistent infections in the host.\n\nThe clinical significance of WUPyV infection is still under investigation, as it has been detected in both healthy individuals and those with respiratory or other medical conditions. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of WUPyV in human health and disease.",
