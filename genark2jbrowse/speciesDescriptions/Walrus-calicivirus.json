  "description": "Walrus calicivirus is a type of virus that primarily infects walruses (Odobenus rosmarus), a large marine mammal found in the Arctic regions. Caliciviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family Caliciviridae.\n\nThe walrus calicivirus is believed to be responsible for causing outbreaks of illness and mortality in walrus populations in certain regions. The virus can potentially lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, in infected walruses. However, the full extent of the disease caused by this virus and its impact on walrus populations is still being studied by researchers.\n\nWalrus calicivirus is thought to be transmitted through contact with infected individuals, their bodily fluids, or contaminated environments. Understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and host-virus interactions of this virus is important for the conservation and management of walrus populations in their native habitats.",
