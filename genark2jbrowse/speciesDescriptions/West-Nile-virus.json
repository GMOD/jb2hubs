  "description": "West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded, enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae and the genus Flavivirus. It is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, with birds serving as the primary reservoir hosts.\n\nThe virus genome consists of approximately 11,000 nucleotides that encode a single polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into three structural (capsid, envelope, and membrane) and seven non-structural proteins. These proteins play essential roles in virus replication, assembly, and pathogenesis.\n\nWest Nile virus is primarily maintained in a bird-mosquito transmission cycle, with Culex mosquitoes serving as the primary vectors. Humans and other mammals can become incidental, dead-end hosts when bitten by infected mosquitoes. While most human infections are asymptomatic or result in mild, flu-like symptoms, the virus can occasionally cause more severe neurological manifestations, such as meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis, especially in the elderly or immunocompromised individuals.\n\nSince its first detection in the United States in 1999, West Nile virus has become endemic in many regions, leading to ongoing public health concerns and the need for continuous surveillance, prevention, and control measures to mitigate its impact on human and animal populations.",
