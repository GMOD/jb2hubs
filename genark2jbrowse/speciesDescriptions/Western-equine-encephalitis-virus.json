  "description": "Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. It is primarily transmitted by infected mosquitoes, primarily from the Culex species, and is found primarily in the western regions of North America.\n\nWEEV can infect both humans and horses, causing a potentially severe neurological disease known as Western equine encephalitis. In humans, the infection can range from asymptomatic to severe, with symptoms including fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and in some cases, neurological complications such as confusion, seizures, and coma.\n\nThe virus is maintained in nature through a cycle involving mosquitoes and wild birds or rodents, which serve as the primary reservoir hosts. Transmission to humans or horses typically occurs through the bite of an infected mosquito. WEEV can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected tissues or fluids, but this is less common.\n\nThere is no specific treatment for Western equine encephalitis, and management primarily involves supportive care. Prevention relies on mosquito control measures, personal protective equipment, and the use of effective mosquito repellents in areas where the virus is known to circulate.",
