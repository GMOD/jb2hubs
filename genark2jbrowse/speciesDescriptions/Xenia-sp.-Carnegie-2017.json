  "description": "Unfortunately, without more specific information about the organism or a reference to a scientific publication, I do not have enough details to provide a comprehensive scientific description for the species \"Xenia sp. Carnegie-2017\". \n\nXenia is a genus of soft corals, but there are many different species within this genus. The \"sp.\" designation indicates it is a specific species, but without further taxonomic information or a reference to a scientific source, I cannot confidently describe the characteristics, habitat, or other details about this particular species.\n\nIn general, soft corals in the genus Xenia are known to be colonial, with polyps that can sway in the water currents. They are commonly found in tropical marine environments. However, to provide a detailed scientific description for the \"Carnegie-2017\" designation would require access to the original scientific literature or other authoritative sources that document this specific species. Without that information, I cannot give a more specific scientific overview.",
