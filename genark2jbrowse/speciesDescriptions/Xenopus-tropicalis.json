  "description": "Xenopus tropicalis, commonly known as the western clawed frog or the African tropical clawed frog, is a small species of aquatic frog belonging to the genus Xenopus. It is native to western Africa, primarily found in regions including Liberia, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Ghana.\n\nXenopus tropicalis is a member of the family Pipidae, a group of fully aquatic frogs characterized by their flattened body shape, complete lack of tongue, and the presence of clawed digits on their hind limbs. This species is a relatively small frog, typically measuring between 4-6 cm in length from snout to vent.\n\nThe skin of Xenopus tropicalis is smooth and grayish-brown in color, with darker mottling or spots. They have a distinctive triangular head and small eyes positioned on the top of the head, which allows them to effectively see and hunt underwater. Their hind limbs are powerful and fully webbed, enabling them to swim swiftly in their aquatic environment.\n\nXenopus tropicalis is an important model organism in developmental biology and genetics research due to its rapid life cycle, ease of maintenance in laboratory settings, and the availability of genetic tools for manipulation. Its genome has been sequenced, making it a valuable tool for comparative genomic studies.\n\nOverall, Xenopus tropicalis is a fascinating amphibian species that has contributed significantly to our understanding of vertebrate development and evolution.",
