  "description": "Xiphophorus couchianus, commonly known as the Couch's swordtail, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the genus Xiphophorus, which are popularly known as swordtails. This species is native to the Rio Salado basin in the Mexican state of Nuevo Le√≥n.\n\nXiphophorus couchianus is characterized by a streamlined body shape and a distinct elongated lower caudal fin lobe, which resembles a sword-like structure. This unique feature gives the species its common name. The fish typically ranges in color from greenish-brown to reddish-brown, with some individuals displaying patterns of vertical bars or spots.\n\nThis species is a member of the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae, meaning that the females give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. Xiphophorus couchianus is known to be a peaceful and hardy fish, making it a popular choice for aquarium hobbyists.\n\nDue to its limited natural range and potential threats from habitat degradation and pollution, the Couch's swordtail is considered a species of conservation concern and is listed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
