  "description": "The Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) is a poxvirus that belongs to the genus Yatapoxvirus. It is an emerging zoonotic virus that primarily infects Old World monkeys, particularly the Yaba monkey (Cercopithecus sp.). YMTV is known to cause a unique form of skin tumors in infected monkeys, which can progress into large, disfiguring lesions.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids. Once the virus enters the host, it targets and infects the skin cells, leading to the development of the characteristic tumor-like growths. These lesions can be highly contagious and may spread to other individuals, both within the same primate species and potentially to humans through close contact.\n\nYMTV is considered a rare and emerging infectious disease, with limited occurrences reported in laboratory settings or in isolated areas where the Yaba monkey and other susceptible primate species are found. The virus's potential for zoonotic transmission and the severity of the disease in humans have made it a subject of interest for epidemiological surveillance and research efforts to better understand its biology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health implications.",
