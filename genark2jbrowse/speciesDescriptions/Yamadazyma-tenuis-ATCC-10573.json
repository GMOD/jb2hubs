  "description": "Yamadazyma tenuis ATCC 10573 is a species of yeast that belongs to the Yamadazyma genus. This yeast was originally isolated from soil and is classified under the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, and order Saccharomycetales.\n\nThe key features of Yamadazyma tenuis ATCC 10573 are as follows:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are generally oval to elongated in shape, and can reproduce by budding.\n\n2. Reproduction: This yeast reproduces asexually through budding, forming new cells as outgrowths from the parent cell.\n\n3. Physiology: Yamadazyma tenuis ATCC 10573 is able to assimilate and ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, as sources of energy and carbon.\n\n4. Habitat: This species is commonly found in soil environments and has been reported to have potential applications in biotechnology and bioremediation processes.\n\n5. Taxonomy: The species name \"tenuis\" refers to the thin or slender nature of the cells. ATCC 10573 is the strain designation for this particular isolate maintained in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).\n\nOverall, Yamadazyma tenuis ATCC 10573 is a well-studied yeast species with potential uses in various industrial and environmental applications due to its metabolic capabilities and adaptability to different ecological niches.",
