  "description": "Yamadazyma tenuis is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, order Saccharomycetales, and family Saccharomycetaceae. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic microorganism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nYamadazyma tenuis is known to be found in various environments, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tract of some animals. It is considered a non-pathogenic yeast species and is not typically associated with any known diseases.\n\nMorphologically, Yamadazyma tenuis cells are typically small, oval or round in shape, and measure around 3-6 micrometers in diameter. The cells have a thin cell wall and can reproduce by forming budding daughter cells.\n\nPhysiologically, Yamadazyma tenuis is known to be able to ferment various sugars, such as glucose, sucrose, and maltose, and can assimilate a range of carbon and nitrogen sources. It is also capable of growing in a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C and a pH range of 3.5 to 8.0.\n\nOverall, Yamadazyma tenuis is a relatively understudied yeast species, and its ecological roles and potential applications in biotechnology or industry remain largely unknown compared to more well-studied yeast species.",
