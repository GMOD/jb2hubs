  "description": "Zaire ebolavirus is a highly pathogenic filovirus that causes Ebola virus disease (EVD) in humans and other primates. It is the most virulent of the known Ebola virus species, with a case fatality rate ranging from 50% to 90% in past outbreaks.\n\nThe Zaire ebolavirus genome is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA molecule approximately 19 kilobases in length. The virus particle is filamentous and pleomorphic, with a diameter of about 80 nanometers and a length that can vary from less than 1 micrometer to over 10 micrometers.\n\nThe virus primarily targets and replicates within host macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to the dysregulation of the immune system and the impairment of vascular function. This results in severe hemorrhagic fever symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising.\n\nZaire ebolavirus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals. The virus can also spread through contaminated surfaces and medical equipment. Outbreaks have occurred primarily in Central and West Africa, with the largest recorded outbreak occurring in West Africa from 2014 to 2016.\n\nEarly detection, isolation of patients, and comprehensive contact tracing are crucial for controlling the spread of Zaire ebolavirus. The development of effective treatments and vaccines remains an important area of ongoing research and public health efforts.",
