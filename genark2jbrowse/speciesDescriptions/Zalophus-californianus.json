  "description": "Zalophus californianus, commonly known as the California sea lion, is a species of eared seal native to the western coast of North America. It belongs to the family Otariidae, which includes sea lions and fur seals.\n\nThe California sea lion is a medium-sized pinniped, with adult males reaching lengths of up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) and weighing up to 350 kilograms (770 pounds). Females are significantly smaller, typically reaching lengths of around 1.8 meters (6 feet) and weighing up to 113 kilograms (250 pounds).\n\nThese marine mammals are known for their distinct \"barking\" vocalizations, which they use for communication and social interactions. They have a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with small, rounded ears, and their front flippers are used for propulsion in the water, while their hind flippers are used for steering and maneuvering.\n\nCalifornia sea lions are highly adaptable and can be found in a variety of habitats, including rocky shores, sandy beaches, and even man-made structures such as docks and piers. They are opportunistic predators, feeding on a wide range of fish, squid, and other marine prey.\n\nThe species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, with a stable population that has recovered from historical declines due to hunting and other human activities. Conservation efforts, including the protection of their breeding and haul-out sites, have contributed to the species' recovery and ongoing survival.",
