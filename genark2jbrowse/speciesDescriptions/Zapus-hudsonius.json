  "description": "Zapus hudsonius, commonly known as the meadow jumping mouse, is a small rodent species native to North America. It belongs to the family Dipodidae, which includes jumping mice and jerboas.\n\nThe meadow jumping mouse is characterized by its elongated hind limbs, which enable it to make impressive leaps of up to 1 meter in length. This adaptation is an evolutionary response to avoid predators and move efficiently through dense vegetation. Its tail is also considerably longer than its body, contributing to its agile movements.\n\nThese mice are typically brownish-gray in color, with a white belly and a distinct dark stripe running along the middle of their back. They are nocturnal and primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of seeds, berries, and green vegetation.\n\nZapus hudsonius is widely distributed across the United States and Canada, inhabiting various habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and riparian areas. They are known for their ability to enter a state of torpor, a form of hibernation, during the winter months to conserve energy and survive the colder seasons.\n\nThe species plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for predators and contributing to the dispersal of plant seeds through their foraging activities.",
