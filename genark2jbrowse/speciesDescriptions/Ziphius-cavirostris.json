  "description": "Ziphius cavirostris, commonly known as the Cuvier's beaked whale, is a species of beaked whale belonging to the family Ziphiidae. It is one of the most widely distributed of the beaked whales, found in tropical and temperate waters throughout the world's oceans.\n\nCuvier's beaked whales are relatively large, with adult males typically reaching lengths of around 5.5-7 meters and weighing between 3-6 tons. They have a distinctive \"beak-like\" rostrum, which is shorter and more rounded compared to other beaked whale species. Their coloration is typically grey or brownish-grey, with a lighter underside.\n\nThese whales are known for their deep-diving capabilities, with recorded dives exceeding 2,000 meters in depth and lasting over 2 hours. They feed primarily on deep-sea squid and fish, using their specialized dentition and suction-feeding techniques to capture their prey.\n\nCuvier's beaked whales are considered one of the least studied of all cetacean species due to their elusive nature and deep-diving behavior. They are classified as \"Least Concern\" on the IUCN Red List, although some populations may be vulnerable to threats such as anthropogenic noise, entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes.",
