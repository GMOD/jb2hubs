  "description": "Zonotrichia albicollis, commonly known as the white-throated sparrow, is a small songbird species native to North America. It belongs to the genus Zonotrichia, which includes several species of sparrows.\n\nThe white-throated sparrow is characterized by its distinctive black and white striped head, with a prominent white throat and yellow lores (the area between the eye and bill). Its back is typically brown, and its underparts are gray. The species exhibits a polymorphic plumage, with both white-striped and tan-striped individuals occurring within the same population.\n\nThese sparrows are known for their clear, whistled song, which is often described as \"Oh-sweet-Canada-Canada-Canada.\" They are primarily ground-foraging birds, feeding on a variety of seeds, insects, and berries. During the breeding season, they typically inhabit coniferous and mixed forests, while in the non-breeding season, they can be found in a variety of habitats, including woodland edges, parks, and suburban areas.\n\nThe white-throated sparrow plays an important role in the ecosystem as a seed disperser and insect predator. It is a widespread and common species, with a large population size and a broad geographic distribution across North America.",
