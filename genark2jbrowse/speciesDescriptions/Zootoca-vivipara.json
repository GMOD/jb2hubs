  "description": "Zootoca vivipara, commonly known as the common lizard or viviparous lizard, is a small species of lizard native to Eurasia. It belongs to the family Lacertidae and is the only truly viviparous (live-bearing) species of lizard found in Europe.\n\nKey features of Zootoca vivipara:\n\n1. Size: The common lizard typically measures between 12-18 cm in total length, with a slender, elongated body and a relatively long tail.\n\n2. Coloration: The species exhibits a range of color variations, including brown, gray, reddish, or blackish hues. There may also be darker spots or stripes along the body.\n\n3. Reproduction: As a viviparous species, the common lizard gives birth to live young, unlike most other lizards that lay eggs. The female retains the eggs inside her body, and the young hatch and emerge fully formed.\n\n4. Habitat: Zootoca vivipara is found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, heathlands, rocky areas, and forests, typically in temperate regions of Europe and Asia.\n\n5. Behavior: The common lizard is relatively agile and can often be observed basking on rocks or logs to regulate its body temperature. It is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates.\n\n6. Conservation status: Zootoca vivipara is classified as a Least Concern species by the IUCN, as it has a wide distribution and is generally common throughout its range.\n\nThis species is an important component of many terrestrial ecosystems, serving as both a predator and prey, and providing insights into the evolution and adaptations of live-bearing reptiles.",
