This species belongs to the Zosteropidae family, a group of small birds characterized by the distinctive ring of feathers around their eyes, which gives them a \"spectacled\" appearance.\n\nThe Zosterops lateralis is a small, slender bird with a length of approximately 10-12 cm and a weight of around 7-12 grams. It has a distinctive gray-green plumage on the back and wings, with a white belly and a conspicuous white eye-ring. The bill is small and pointed, and the legs are typically pale in color.\n\nThis species is known for its highly social behavior, often seen foraging in small flocks and engaging in coordinated movements. They primarily feed on insects, nectar, and small fruits, playing an important role in the pollination and seed dispersal of various plant species.\n\nZosterops lateralis is widely distributed across its native range, with several recognized subspecies exhibiting slight variations in plumage and morphological characteristics. The species is known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in a wide range of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and urban areas.",
