  "description": "Zoysia japonica, commonly known as Japanese lawngrass or Korean lawngrass, is a perennial, warm-season turfgrass species native to East Asia, particularly Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, fine-textured foliage and its ability to form a thick, carpet-like lawn.\n\nThe leaves of Zoysia japonica are narrow, green, and have a distinct waxy appearance. The plant reproduces primarily through underground stems called rhizomes, which allow it to spread and form a dense, uniform ground cover. It is known for its exceptional drought tolerance, salt tolerance, and ability to thrive in a wide range of soil types.\n\nZoysia japonica is a popular choice for lawns, golf courses, and other landscaping applications in temperate and subtropical regions. It is valued for its low maintenance requirements, as it needs infrequent mowing and can tolerate low-to-moderate levels of foot traffic. The species is also known for its ability to suppress weed growth and provide a lush, green appearance throughout the growing season.",
