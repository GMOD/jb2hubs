  "description": "Zymoseptoria tritici IPO323 is a fungal pathogen that causes the disease known as Septoria tritici blotch (STB) in wheat plants. It is a filamentous ascomycete fungus that belongs to the genus Zymoseptoria.\n\nThe IPO323 strain is a well-studied laboratory reference strain of Z. tritici, which has been widely used in research due to its genetic tractability and the availability of its fully sequenced genome. This strain was originally isolated from a wheat field in the Netherlands.\n\nZ. tritici IPO323 is a hemibiotrophic fungus, meaning it exhibits both biotrophic and necrotrophic phases during its lifecycle. It infects wheat leaves and initially grows within the leaf tissue without causing visible symptoms, representing the biotrophic phase. As the infection progresses, the fungus switches to a necrotrophic phase, causing the formation of necrotic lesions on the leaf surface, which is the characteristic symptom of Septoria tritici blotch.\n\nThe genome of Z. tritici IPO323 is relatively large, comprising approximately 40 million base pairs and encoding around 10,000 genes. The availability of the genome sequence has facilitated extensive research into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity and host-pathogen interactions of this important wheat pathogen.",
