  "description": "Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Parvoviridae family and the Dependovirus genus. It is a replication-deficient virus, requiring the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus or herpes simplex virus, to replicate efficiently.\n\nThe AAV2 genome is approximately 4.7 kilobases in size and contains two open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the viral proteins. The first ORF encodes the Rep proteins, which are essential for viral DNA replication and integration, while the second ORF encodes the capsid proteins, which form the viral protein shell.\n\nAAV2 has a broad host range and can infect a variety of human and animal cells, including muscle, liver, and nervous system cells. However, it does not cause any known diseases in humans and is considered a safe and promising vector for gene therapy applications.\n\nThe unique features of AAV2, such as its ability to integrate into the host genome, its low immunogenicity, and its broad tropism, have made it a widely used vector in various gene therapy studies and clinical trials for the treatment of genetic disorders, cancer, and other diseases.",
