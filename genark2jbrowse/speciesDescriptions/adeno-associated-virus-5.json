  "description": "Adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5) is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus belonging to the Dependovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It is a small, single-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 4.7 kilobases.\n\nAAV5 is considered a \"helper-dependent\" virus, meaning that it requires the presence of a helper virus, such as an adenovirus or a herpes virus, to efficiently replicate and produce infectious particles. Without the helper virus, AAV5 can enter the host cell but remains in a latent, non-replicative state.\n\nThe viral capsid of AAV5 is composed of three viral proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) that assemble to form the icosahedral structure. The viral genome contains two main coding regions: the rep gene, which encodes proteins involved in viral replication and integration, and the cap gene, which encodes the structural proteins that make up the viral capsid.\n\nAAV5 has a broad tissue tropism, meaning it can infect a variety of cell types, including neuronal, muscle, and respiratory cells. This property, along with its relative safety and low immunogenicity, has made AAV5 a promising candidate for gene therapy applications, where it can be used as a vector to deliver therapeutic genes to target tissues.",
