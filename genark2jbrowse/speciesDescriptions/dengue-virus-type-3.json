  "description": "Dengue virus type 3 (DENV-3) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is one of the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), which are the causative agents of the mosquito-borne infectious disease known as dengue fever.\n\nDENV-3 is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are the primary vectors for dengue virus transmission. Upon infection, the virus replicates within the host's cells, particularly in dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells, leading to the development of dengue fever symptoms.\n\nThe genome of DENV-3 consists of approximately 10,700 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) that are essential for viral replication and assembly.\n\nDENV-3 is known to cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe, potentially life-threatening complications, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The severity of the disease is influenced by factors such as the infecting virus serotype, the host's immune response, and the presence of pre-existing immunity to other dengue virus serotypes.\n\nEffective prevention and control of DENV-3 infection rely on integrated strategies, including mosquito vector control, early diagnosis, and appropriate clinical management of dengue cases. Ongoing research is focused on the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapies to combat the global burden of dengue virus infections.",
