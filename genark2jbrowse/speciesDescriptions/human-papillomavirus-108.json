  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 108 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species. HPV-108 is a specific genotype within the HPV species, characterized by its unique DNA sequence and genomic organization.\n\nHPV-108 is primarily associated with the development of benign skin warts, known as cutaneous papillomas, in infected individuals. The virus targets the basal layer of the epidermis, where it can replicate and induce the proliferation of infected cells, leading to the formation of visible warts on the skin.\n\nThe HPV-108 genome consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the early (E) proteins involved in viral replication and the late (L) proteins that make up the viral capsid structure.\n\nTransmission of HPV-108 typically occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus can persist in the host for extended periods, sometimes remaining latent and asymptomatic before reactivating and causing the development of new warts.\n\nWhile HPV-108 infections are generally considered benign and self-limiting, they can be a cosmetic concern for affected individuals. In some cases, the warts may cause discomfort or interfere with daily activities. Treatment options for HPV-108 infections may include topical therapies, cryotherapy, or surgical removal of the affected lesions.",
