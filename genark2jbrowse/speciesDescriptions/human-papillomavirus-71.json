  "description": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) 71 is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HPV 71 is classified as a member of the Alpha-Papillomavirus genus and is considered a low-risk HPV type.\n\nHPV 71 primarily infects the mucosal and cutaneous epithelial cells of the human body, particularly in the anogenital region. The virus can cause the development of benign warts or papillomas, which are usually harmless and self-limiting. However, in some cases, persistent infection with HPV 71 has been associated with the development of low-grade cervical dysplasia, a precancerous condition that may progress to cervical cancer if left untreated.\n\nThe HPV 71 genome consists of approximately 8,000 base pairs and encodes for several viral proteins, including the early (E) proteins, which are involved in viral replication and transformation, and the late (L) proteins, which are the structural components of the viral capsid.\n\nEpidemiologically, HPV 71 is considered a relatively rare HPV type, with a lower prevalence compared to the more common high-risk HPV types, such as HPV 16 and HPV 18, which are the primary causative agents of cervical cancer. The transmission of HPV 71 is primarily through sexual contact, and the virus can persist in the host for extended periods, leading to the potential for reactivation and recurrent infections.",
