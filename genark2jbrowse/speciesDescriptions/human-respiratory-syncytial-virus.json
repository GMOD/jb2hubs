  "description": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a highly contagious, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Pneumoviridae family. It is a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections, particularly in infants and young children, and can also affect adults.\n\nThe hRSV virus primarily targets the upper and lower respiratory tract, causing conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The virus enters the host cells through the attachment of its surface glycoproteins to specific receptors on the cell membrane. Once inside, the viral genome is released, and the virus hijacks the host's cellular machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles.\n\nTransmission of hRSV occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces, as well as through aerosolized particles. The virus can cause severe illness, especially in high-risk populations, including premature infants, young children with underlying medical conditions, and older adults.\n\nDiagnosis of hRSV infection typically involves molecular testing, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rapid antigen detection tests. Treatment options are primarily supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and providing respiratory support when necessary. Ongoing research is aimed at developing effective vaccines and antiviral therapies to prevent and treat hRSV infections.",
