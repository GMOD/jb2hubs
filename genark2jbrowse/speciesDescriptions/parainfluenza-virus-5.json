  "description": "Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5), also known as simian virus 5 (SV5), is a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, genus Rubulavirus. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects animals, including canines, felines, and primates.\n\nThe virus genome consists of approximately 15,000 nucleotides and encodes at least seven structural proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and large (L) proteins. These proteins play crucial roles in the virus's replication, assembly, and host cell entry.\n\nPIV-5 is known to cause respiratory tract infections in various animal species, and it has been used as a model system for studying the pathogenesis and immune responses associated with paramyxovirus infections. While it can infect humans, it is not considered a major human pathogen and is not typically associated with severe disease in humans.\n\nThe virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces, and it can also be spread through aerosolized respiratory droplets. PIV-5 is capable of evading the host's immune response by interfering with the signaling pathways that regulate the production of antiviral cytokines, such as interferons.\n\nResearch on PIV-5 has contributed to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying paramyxovirus replication and pathogenesis, and it has potential applications in the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies targeting related human pathogens, such as the human parainfluenza viruses.",
