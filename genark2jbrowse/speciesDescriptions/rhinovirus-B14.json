  "description": "Rhinovirus B14 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Rhinovirus B14 is one of the causative agents of the common cold, a respiratory illness characterized by nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, and other upper respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe virus enters the host cells, primarily the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, through the interaction of its capsid proteins with specific cellular receptors. Once inside the host cell, the viral RNA is released and hijacks the cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles. The newly assembled virions are then released from the host cell, ready to infect other cells and continue the cycle of infection.\n\nRhinovirus B14 is known to exhibit genetic and antigenic diversity, which can lead to the development of new strains and contribute to the ability of the virus to evade the host's immune response. This genetic variability also poses challenges for the development of effective vaccines and antiviral treatments against rhinovirus infections.",
