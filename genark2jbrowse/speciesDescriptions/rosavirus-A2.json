  "description": "Rosavirus A2 is a member of the Rosavirus genus within the Reoviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects roses and other ornamental plants in the Rosaceae family.\n\nThe viral genome of Rosavirus A2 consists of 10 to 12 segmented RNA strands, which encode various structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly. The virus particles are icosahedral in shape and range in size from 60 to 80 nanometers in diameter.\n\nRosavirus A2 is known to cause a variety of symptoms in infected rose plants, including leaf discoloration, stunted growth, and reduced flower production. The virus is primarily transmitted through mechanical means, such as pruning tools or by plant-to-plant contact, and can also be spread by certain insect vectors.\n\nResearch on Rosavirus A2 is ongoing, as scientists continue to study its epidemiology, host range, and potential impact on the ornamental plant industry. Understanding the biology and characteristics of this virus is crucial for developing effective management strategies to minimize its spread and impact on rose cultivation.",
