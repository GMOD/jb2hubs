  "description": "Sandfly fever Turkey virus (SFTUV) is a species of virus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus, which is part of the family Phenuiviridae. SFTUV is an arbovirus, meaning it is transmitted by arthropod vectors, specifically sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus.\n\nThe SFTUV virion is spherical in shape and has a diameter of approximately 80-120 nanometers. The viral genome consists of three single-stranded RNA segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L). These RNA segments encode the various structural and non-structural proteins required for the virus's replication and assembly.\n\nSFTUV is primarily found in Turkey and other parts of the Middle East, where it is a causative agent of sandfly fever, also known as pappataci fever or three-day fever. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies, and it can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. In most cases, the illness is self-limiting and resolves within a few days, but severe cases can occur, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nDiagnostic methods for SFTUV infection typically involve serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or virus neutralization assays, to detect the presence of specific antibodies in the patient's blood. Treatment for sandfly fever is mostly supportive, focusing on symptom management, as there are no specific antiviral therapies available.",
