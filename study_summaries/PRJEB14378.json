Most varieties belong to the 2 main groups, indica and japonica, including tropical and temperate japonica, whereas others represent the aus, deep water, and aromatic rice groups. Here, we describe the discovery of high-quality, nonredundant SNPs distributed across the entire genomes of the OryzaSNPset.","taxonomyId":[4530],"speciesCommonName":"Rice","speciesScientificName":"Oryza sativa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"International Rice Research Institute","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"IRGSP-1.0","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001433935.1","platform":"unspecified","url":"www.oryzasnp.org","publications":["PubMed:19597147","Pubmed:19597147"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":20,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
