WGS from five individuals each of Djallonke and Sahelian sheep was sequenced on an Ion Proton. A total of approximately 404 million (97%) and 343 million (97%) sequence reads from the Djallonke and Sahelian genomes respectively were successfully mapped to the sheep reference genome  Oar_3.1/oviAri3. The mapped samples for each breed were then pooled. Variants were called/genotyped using a pipeline modified from GATK best practices.","taxonomyId":[9940],"speciesCommonName":"Sheep","speciesScientificName":"Ovis aries","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Curtin University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000298735.1","platform":"unspecified","url":"http://oasisapps.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/D.Groth","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":10,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
