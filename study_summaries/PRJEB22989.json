Nature Genetics 2017. Sample information can be found in Data S1 of the publication above. There is one VCF file per chromosome. Genotypes are not imputed and unphased. There is missing data. Note that there also is a imputed and phased dataset of biallelic SNPs available as a separate submission which might be more useful for many applications. Fixed differences between vervet and macaque have been added to the VCFs (mainly the sites with AC=0 and AF=0.000) so that variant effects are also annotated for divergent sites between vervet and macaque. Where available, the macaque state is given by the INFO tag 'AA'. Variant effects have been annotated.
