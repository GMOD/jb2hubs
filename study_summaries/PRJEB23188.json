The sunflower breeding program at the Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria (INTA) produced the first Argentinean varieties with the introduction of early materials from Russia, Canada, and Romania, as well as through introgression with wild Helianthus species. This project comprises the SNP variants used to build a custom oligo pool assay used in the frame of the sunflower breeding program for biotic and abiotic stress resistance.","taxonomyId":[4232],"speciesCommonName":"Sunflower","speciesScientificName":"Helianthus annuus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002127325.1","platform":"unspecified","url":"-","publications":["PubMed:29261806"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":110,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
