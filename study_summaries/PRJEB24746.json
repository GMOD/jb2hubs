Cattle have different expected proportions of Angus- Brahman breed composition. A total number of 800 animals were genotyped with the 250K Bovine SNP BeadChip (GeneSeek, Inc., Lincoln, NE). Ten additional SNPs and four indels were genotyped by High Resolution Melt (HRM) analysis on an Illuminaâ€™s Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina, USA).","taxonomyId":[9913],"speciesCommonName":"Cow","speciesScientificName":"Bos taurus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Florida, Department of Animal Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003055.3","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":800,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
