We performed genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to identify genetic variants underlying toxin tolerance, and gene knockouts and allele-swap experiments to validate the involvement of implicated genes. In the process of this work, we uncovered a surprising difference in genetic architecture depending on strain background: in all but one case, knockout of implicated genes had a significant effect on toxin tolerance in one strain, but no effect in another strain.","taxonomyId":[559292],"speciesCommonName":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae","speciesScientificName":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000146045.2","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":165,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
