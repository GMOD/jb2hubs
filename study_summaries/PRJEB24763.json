Hepatic DNA was sourced from 120 cattle presenting for postmortem examination at the University of Guelph. The animals were divided into pools of 5 animals each based on the similarity of postmortem diagnosis and all pools were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq. Variants were called using GATK and allele frequency analysis performed using Popoolation2.","taxonomyId":[9913],"speciesCommonName":"Cow","speciesScientificName":"Bos taurus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Guelph","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Curation","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Curation","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003055.3","platform":"Illumina MiSeq","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":24,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
