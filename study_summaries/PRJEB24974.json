Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is an efficient way to detect the regulatory elements of genes, especially the trans-eQTLs help to construct the regulatory networks of genes and contribute to a better understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms of biological processes. Till now, the 15 DAP (day after pollination) eQTL has been elucidated in maize kernel, but little is known about the early stage. Here, we analyzed the SNP and gene expression profiles and conducted eQTL analysis for 5 DAP maize kernel using 282 maize inbred lines. The results will provide insights into the genetic basis of early kernel development.","taxonomyId":[4577],"speciesCommonName":"Maize","speciesScientificName":"Zea mays","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Biotechnology Research Institute, CAAS","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000005005.5","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":282,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
