The reference genome sequence was used to discover high-quality and nonredundant SNPs, which helped to obtain a higher-resolution genetic map with 18 linkage groups. Additionally, this project provided a better undestanding of QTL associated with growth and drought.","taxonomyId":[3981],"speciesCommonName":"Rubber tree","speciesScientificName":"Hevea brasiliensis","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Center of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering (CBMEG), UNICAMP","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Curation","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Curation","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001654055.1","platform":"Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":145,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
