A bioinformatics pipeline was developed and allowed to detect 61,771 in silico SNPs distributed among 13,543 genes The true positive rate for this set of SNPs was estimated using a sample of 5571 predicted SNPs by genotyping 1130 P. abies trees using an Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP array. The true positive rate for the set of in silico SNPs was 84.2% and was comparable to the genotyping success rate of 85.4% for a set of 89 P. abies control SNPs successfully genotyped on previous Illumina GoldenGate genotyping arrays.
