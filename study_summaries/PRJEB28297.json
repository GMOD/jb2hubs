Starting from only ~1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries that retain long range information. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"10X Genomics","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing, Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS, ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina HiSeq X Ten, Illumina HiSeq 4000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":3,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
