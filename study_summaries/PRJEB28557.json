To determine the variety of ASIP expression in the Muchuan black-bone chicken, we examined genetic variation in the ASIP promoter region. A single nucleotide polymorphism (c. -1826 A &gt; T) was found to be associated with the skin color (dorsal and subalar) of black-bone chicken.","taxonomyId":[9031],"speciesCommonName":"Chicken","speciesScientificName":"Gallus gallus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Engineering Research Center of Sichuan Province Higher School of Local Chicken Breeds Industrialization in Southern Sichuan","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000002315.5","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
