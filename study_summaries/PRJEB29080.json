A final set of 57- SNP assays was successfully designed and validated using MassARRAY system. The SNP resources developed in this study should facilitate ongoing efforts in selective breeding and conservation of white bass.","taxonomyId":[46259],"speciesCommonName":"White bass","speciesScientificName":"Morone chrysops","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Auburn University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_003610055.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":166,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
