This approach, however, has been hampered by the lack of markers that can be used to track introduced chromosome segments. Here, we describe the identification of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphism-based markers that can be used to genotype hexaploid wheat and to identify and track introgression from a variety of sources representing its secondary and tertiary gene pools. We have validated our markers using a high density Axiom? genotyping array. Use of the ultra-high density platform to genotype a range of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat lines and wheat relatives has confirmed the utility of the markers across a range of species.","taxonomyId":[4565],"speciesCommonName":"Wheat","speciesScientificName":"Triticum aestivum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"NCBI","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_900519105.1","platform":"Illumina Genome Analyzer II","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":475,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
