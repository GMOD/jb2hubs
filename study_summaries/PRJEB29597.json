A total of 15 tumors did not harbor somatic non-synonymous mutations and were not included in this submission. All the tumors were procured prior to initiation of any of the three clinically efficacious CDK4/6i (palbociclib, ribociclib or abemaciclib; although the majority of patients received palbociclib in this cohort). We then performed an analysis to determine the association between somatic mutations and copy number alterations inferred to be biologically and therapeutically relevant with progression-free survival on CDK4/6i.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"MSKCC","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":333,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
