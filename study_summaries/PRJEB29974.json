All the PCR products were sequenced by ABI3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA, USA). Then, we aligned the sequences with the reference genome (UMD3.1.1) using the BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), and identified the novel SNP, g.10250120A/G.","taxonomyId":[9913],"speciesCommonName":"Cow","speciesScientificName":"Bos taurus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"China Agricultural University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003055.5","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
