Our results provide insights into the contemporary genetic structure and past demographic processes of wild boar populations under the effects of glaciations and possible human manipulations.","taxonomyId":[415978],"speciesCommonName":"Wild boar","speciesScientificName":"Sus scrofa scrofa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Yunnan Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Domestic Animals, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, China","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003025.6","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":77,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
