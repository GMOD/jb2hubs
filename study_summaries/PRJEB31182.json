SNP markers will be used in the project. A resistance-diversified wheat population was investigated. Wheat resistance to the fungus and other parameters, which are significant in the farming of the cultivar, ware determined in a field. The project included a characterization of the fungal population in terms of the occurrence of its races and biology. The goal of the project was an investigation of the wheat population in terms of its resistance to the fungus, finding the markers linkage to resistance, a characterization of the fungal population and the determination of some elements.","taxonomyId":[4565],"speciesCommonName":"Wheat","speciesScientificName":"Triticum aestivum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Poznan University of Life Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_900519105.1","platform":"Illumina MiSeq","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
