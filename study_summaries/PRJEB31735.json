We believe this will be a useful reference resource for those working on GRCh38, representing an improvement over the lift-overs of 1000 Genomes data that have been available to date and providing a resource necessary for the full adoption of GRCh38 by the community. This call set extends the call set available in ENA study PRJEB30460 containing only the SNVs and includes also the INDELs.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"EMBL-EBI","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.27","platform":"Illumina","url":"https://www.internationalgenome.org/","publications":["PubMed:32175479"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2548,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
