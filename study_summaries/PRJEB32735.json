We carried out linkage mapping using 148 recombinant inbred lines derived from IR29 and Pokkali. The extracted genomic DNA was subjected to genotyping with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using an Affymetrix Axiom Rice 56k SNP Genotyping Array.The manuscript related to the project is &quot;Identification of new QTL for salt tolerance from rice variety Pokkali&quot;.","taxonomyId":[4530],"speciesCommonName":"Rice","speciesScientificName":"Oryza sativa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"ICS, CAAS","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001433935.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":148,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
