We detected 4,336 large and rare CNVs events (size &gt; 100 kb, frequency &lt; 1%). CNV burden analysis revealed a significant association of CNVs with GSD, with the strongest effect observed in men with CNVs overlapping lipid metabolism genes.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Cologne Center for Genomics","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":3134,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
