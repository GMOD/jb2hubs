This mutation was mapped to a 4.9 Mb region of chromosome 11, and which is sequenced in this project in several individuals of the UCD cpp.003 line with the aim of assessing variation linked to the mutation, and ultimately determining the causative element.","taxonomyId":[9031],"speciesCommonName":"Chicken","speciesScientificName":"Gallus gallus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"UC Davis","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Curation","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Curation","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000002315.3","platform":"Illumina MiSeq","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":26,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
