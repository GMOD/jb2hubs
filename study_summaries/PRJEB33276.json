Clinical course may present as a mild or severe illness. The influence of genetic factors of the host in the different clinical courses is currently poorly understood. Our goal was to identify copy number variats (CNVs) associated with different clinical courses (mild or severe) in patients infected with ANDV. We recruited 195 patients (88 mild and 107 severe). Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0. We performed CNVs Genome Wide Association (GWAs) analisys.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Instituto de Ciencias e Innovacion en Medicina, Universidad del Desarrollo","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.15","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":195,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
