A genome-wide association study gave an indicative signal on canine chromosome 21. Although the signal was not of genome-wide significance due to the small number of cases, the SBF2 (also known as MTMR13) gene within the region of shared case homozygosity was a strong positional candidate, as 22 genetic variants in the gene have been associated with demyelinating forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in humans. Sequencing of SBF2 in cases revealed a splice donor site genetic variant, resulting in cryptic splicing and predicted early termination of the protein based on RNA sequencing results.","taxonomyId":[9615],"speciesCommonName":"Dog","speciesScientificName":"Canis lupus familiaris","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Royal Veterinary College","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000002285.2","platform":"Illumina CanineHD","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
