The Bruton?s tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib is one of the first-in-class molecules available for the treatment of B-CLL patients able to disrupt the microenvironment protection. However, the emerging mechanisms of resistance affecting patients? survival call for new therapeutic strategies. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the ability of ibrutinib plus the MDM2-inhibitor nutlin-3 to counteract the tumor microenvironment protective effect","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Ferrara","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Target Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"TS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Ion Torrent PGM","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":26,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
