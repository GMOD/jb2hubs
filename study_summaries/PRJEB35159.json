Overexpression of CNRIP1 because of this rare genomic duplication was dectected in all duplication carriers tested but not in noncarriers.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Otorhinolaryngology lab/LIM32 - Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de S?o Paulo","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["PubMed:32337552"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":47,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
