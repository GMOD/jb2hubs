Then, to avoid as false-positive variants as much possible, variant-quality-filtering and allele-frequency-filtering processes were conducted to the obtained variants. Finally, 9,650,073 bi-allelic SNP variants with minor allele frequency &gt; 1% were identified for the 245 soybean accessions and utilized to this project.","taxonomyId":[3847],"speciesCommonName":"Soybean","speciesScientificName":"Glycine max","sourceType":"Germline","center":"KRIBB","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000004515.4","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":245,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
