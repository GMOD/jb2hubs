(J. regia) was used as the reference sequence. As a result, the average percentage of sequence reads that mapped to the reference genome was 88.51%, and 7 360 659 putative SNPs were obtained. The number of clean reads for each individual drastically varied between 7 018 308 and 22 424 696. After applying successive filters, 160 309 (2.18%) SNPs were deemed adequate. The 160 309 SNPs were aligned against the genome of J. regia `Chandler?. All of the SNPs were mapped across 4 743 of the 105 811 contigs in `Chandler?. The highest representation was obtained for LIHL01055144 (1116 SNPs), and 629 contigs were detected with only 1 SNP.","taxonomyId":[51240],"speciesCommonName":"Common walnut","speciesScientificName":"Juglans regia","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Forestry, Sichuan Agricultural University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001411555.1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 4000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":44,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
