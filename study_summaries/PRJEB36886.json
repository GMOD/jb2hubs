Many single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified by genome-wide association studies and were found to be associated with PE; however, few studies have used whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify PE variants.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Beijing Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Capital Medical University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":6,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
