First, simplified genomic sequencing (RAD-sequencing) technology was used to screen SNPs with significant differences in allele frequencies between high and low growth performance groups, and the correlation between these SNPs and goose body weight was further analyzed through population verification. Based on this, the genes of SNPs were cloned. And study gene function. SNPs significantly related to growth performance were used as molecular markers in actual breeding of geese. The SNP from this project was originally reported in the 3-prime direction (C/T) (VCF G/A 5-prime).","taxonomyId":[8845],"speciesCommonName":"Swan goose","speciesScientificName":"Anser cygnoides","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Animal Science and Technology, Nanjing Agricultural University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000971095.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
