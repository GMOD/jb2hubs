Complex 3D models provide a challenging platform for the quantitative analysis of drug responses of therapies that have differential effects on tumour cell subpopulations. We demonstrated that morphometric analyses can capture subtle alterations in organoid responses to Wnt inhibitors that are consistent with activity against a cancer stem cell subpopulation, highlighting the value of phenotypic readouts as a quantitative method to assess drug-induced effects in a relevant preclinical model.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Cardiff University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 4000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":20,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
