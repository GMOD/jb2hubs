The DSD are usually responsible for sterility or infertility and thus their occurrence in domestic animals is considered as an important breeding problem. The aim of the project is searching for the causative mutations in  DSD dogs using whole genome sequencing, ddPCR and Sanger sequencing techniques.","taxonomyId":[9615],"speciesCommonName":"Dog","speciesScientificName":"Canis lupus familiaris","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poznan, Poland","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000002285.2","platform":"ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
