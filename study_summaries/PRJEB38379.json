DNA was processed and sequenced against a custom targeted array for genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and immediate early genes. SNP analyses were conducted and compared between sham and irradiated animals.","taxonomyId":[10090],"speciesCommonName":"Mouse","speciesScientificName":"Mus musculus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001635.1","platform":"Illumina MiniSeq","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":29,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
