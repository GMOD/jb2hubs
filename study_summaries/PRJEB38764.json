Genetic improvement programs and domestication process of Nile tilapia may have modified the genome through selective pressure, leaving signals that can be detected at the molecular level. In this work, signatures of selection were identified using whole-genome re-sequencing of 326 individuals from three strains (A, B and C) of farmed tilapia maintained in Brazil and Costa Rica was carried out using Illumina HiSeq 2500 technology. After applying conventional SNP-calling and quality-control pipelines, ~1.3M high-quality SNPs. We detected several candidate genes putatively subjected to selection in each strain. These candidate genes represent putative genomic landmarks that could contain functions of biological and commercial interest.","taxonomyId":[8128],"speciesCommonName":"Tilapia","speciesScientificName":"Oreochromis niloticus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Chile","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001858045.3","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":280,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
