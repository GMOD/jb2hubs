Three months following irradiation, animals were tested for hippocampus-dependent cognitive performance in the Y-Maze and Novel Object Recognition (NOR) paradigms. Upon sacrifice, brains were fixated and morphological assessments were conducted on hippocampal tissues.","taxonomyId":[10090],"speciesCommonName":"Mouse","speciesScientificName":"Mus musculus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001635.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":30,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
