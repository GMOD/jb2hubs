We combined CITE-seq with two levels of multiplexing (cell hashing and individuals? genotypes) to derive a reference database of immune cell gene/protein responses to different activation conditions. PBMCs from 10 healthy adults were profiled before and after stimulating i) T cells via anti-CD3/CD28 or ii) monocytes via LPS. By using a comprehensive antibody panel (n=39) of cell type (e.g., CD16, CD14) and cell state (e.g., CD69, CD25) markers, we discovered that all lymphocytes responded to anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, whereas LPS specifically induced inflammation in monocytes. Pseudo-temporal analyses further revealed cell- and condition-specific heterogeneity in responses to activation that were independent of individual-specific variation. Together, these data are shared within an interactive web application (https://czi-pbmc-cite-seq.jax.org/) and will serve as a resource to guide future studies of immune cell responses.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"The Jackson Laboratory","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":10,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
