While the wild-caught A. tigrinum was generally more polymorphic in a genome-wide sense, several multi-megabase regions were identified from A. mexicanum genomes that were actually more polymorphic than A. tigrinum. Analysis of polymorphism and repeat content reveals that these regions likely originated from the intentional hybridization of A. mexicanum and A. tigrinum that was used to introduce the albino mutation into laboratory stocks.","taxonomyId":[8296],"speciesCommonName":"Salamander","speciesScientificName":"Ambystoma mexicanum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Kentucky","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002915635.2","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500, Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":3,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
