A total of 414 accessions of 5 species, 25 subspecies from 71 countries were collected, including 91 diploid Triticum accessions (AA taxa), 30 diploid Ae. tauschii accessions (DD taxa), 121 tetraploid accessions (AABB taxa), and 172 hexaploid accessions (AABBDD taxa).","taxonomyId":[4565],"speciesCommonName":"Wheat","speciesScientificName":"Triticum aestivum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology Chinese Academy of Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_900519105.1","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":414,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
