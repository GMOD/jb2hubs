Here, a large population including 982 maize inbred lines which represent global tropical, subtropical, and temperate germplasm and 190 teosinte accessions from Mexico and Central America were genotyped using Illumina MaizeSNP50 BeadChip to (1) define the Zea genetic structure, (2) estimate the magnitude of introgression from parviglumis and mexicana into the domesticated maize gene pool, (3) identify the loci underwent selection during maize domestication and adaptation, and (4) associate the selected loci with the key domestication and adaptation traits.","taxonomyId":[4577],"speciesCommonName":"Maize","speciesScientificName":"Zea mays","sourceType":"Germline","center":"National Maize Improvement Center of China","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000005005.5","platform":"Illumina Genome Analyzer","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1172,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
