However, family-based genetic haplotyping (FBH) requires pedigrees, and molecular haplotyping remains a major challenge due to its high cost, long processing time, and complex procedure. Here, we propose a new approach termed population-based haplotyping NIPT (PBH-NIPT) using thalassemia as a prototype.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Tianjin Medical Laboratory, BGI-Tianjin","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Target Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"TS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"BGISEQ-500","url":"-","publications":["PubMed:33546747"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":236,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
