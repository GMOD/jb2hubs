Since the etiology of SH remains obscure, we aimed to identify the biological and genetic mechanisms involved in its occurrence through the whole transcriptome analysis of SH affected and unaffected pigs inguinal ring. Umbilical hernia (UH) is one of the most frequent defects affecting pig production, however, it also affects humans and other mammals. UH is characterized as an abnormal protrusion of the abdominal contents to the umbilical region, causing pain, discomfort and reduced performance in pigs. Some genomic regions associated to UH have already been identified, however, no study involving RNA sequencing was performed when umbilical tissue is considered. Therefore, here, we have sequenced the umbilical ring transcriptome of five normal and five UH-affected pigs to uncover genes and pathways involved with UH development.","taxonomyId":[9823],"speciesCommonName":"Pig","speciesScientificName":"Sus scrofa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"EMBRAPA Swine and Poultry","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Transcriptome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WTS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003025.6","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":18,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
