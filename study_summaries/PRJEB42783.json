The project aims to develop a resource to allow project partners to impute full genome sequence in bulls and cows that have been genotyped with SNP arrays. This could be used, for example, for improving the accuracy of genomic prediction, as well as in genome wide association studies interested in the identification of causal mutations.","taxonomyId":[9903],"speciesCommonName":"Cattle","speciesScientificName":"Bos","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Agriculture Victoria","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002263795.2","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1832,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
