This CRPM included specific patient characteristics, such as SNPs, gender, and factors like the participants being the only child of the respective families, to provide an estimate of the absolute risk of a specific caries outcome. We believe that our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because the newly constructed CRPM can accurately identify a high caries-risk population","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Guanghua School of Stomatology, Sun Yat-sen University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.28","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1055,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
