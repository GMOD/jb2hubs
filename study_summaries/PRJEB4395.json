Here we describe the whole-genome resequencing of eight tomato samples chosen to represent a large range of intra-specific variability and the identification and annotation of novel polymorphisms.Comparison of the sequences with the reference genome yielded more than 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and almost 128,000 InDels were detected.This study represents the first whole genome resequencing experiment in cultivated tomato.","taxonomyId":[4081],"speciesCommonName":"Tomato","speciesScientificName":"Solanum lycopersicum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique - France","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"SL2.40","assemblyAccession":"GCF_000188115.1","platform":"Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx","url":"http://www.tomatogenome.net/index.html","publications":["PubMed:24228636"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":8,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
