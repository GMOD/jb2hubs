The molecular basis of this disease has not been characterized at the genomic level. Here we characterized 41 clinical tumor samples (and related normal samples) from 30 YST patients, with distinct responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":71,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
