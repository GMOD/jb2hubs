Biliary tract intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN) is the common benign tumor that is suspected to be precancerous lesions. However, the genetic and evolutionary relationships between BilIN and carcinoma remain unclear. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing of coexisting low-grade BilIN (adenoma), high-grade BilIN, and carcinoma lesions, and normal tissues from the same patients.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":44,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
