We assessed a cohort of patients with MTLE+HS and healthy controls. We investigated the genetic association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL1B gene, including evaluation of population stratification using random genomic control SNPs on chromosome 2, where IL1B gene is located.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"UNICAMP","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Curation","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Curation","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"AB 3130 Genetic Analyzer","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":393,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
