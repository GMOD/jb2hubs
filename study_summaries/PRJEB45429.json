F2 crosses and advanced intercrosses of female C57BL/6J and male DBA/2J inbred mice have been inbred for many generations, producing RILs that are unique mosaics of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J haplotypes. Spleens from each mouse were whole-genome sequenced using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. FASTQ files were aligned to the mm10/GRCm38 reference genome, and VCF files were generated using the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK).","taxonomyId":[10090],"speciesCommonName":"Mouse","speciesScientificName":"Mus musculus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Department of Genetics, Genomics and Informatics","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001635.2","platform":"Illumina HiSeq X Ten","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":157,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
