Briefly, reads are mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, variants are called using LoFreq and annotated using SnpEff . VCFs associated with this project are unfiltered variant calls and as such may contain false positives calls and homopolymer errors. BAM files are provided as output by the analysis workflow along with a simple coverage information file. Users are advised to use these in association with the VCFs to perform any filtering tasks prior to using these VCFs for downstream analysis presentation or analysis.
