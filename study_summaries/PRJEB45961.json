Over the course of >140 generations, selection on the control line has given rise to two extremely fertile lines (>20 pups per litter each), two giant growth lines (one lean, one obese) and one long-distance running line. Genomic analysis revealed line-specific patterns of genetic variation among lines and high levels of homozygosity within lines as a result of long-term intensive selection, genetic drift and isolation. Detection of line-specific patterns of genetic differentiation and structural variation revealed multiple candidate genes behind the improvement of the selected traits. We conclude that the genomes of these lines are rich in beneficial alleles for the respective selected traits and represent an invaluable resource for unraveling the polygenic basis of fertility, obesity, muscle growth and endurance fitness.","taxonomyId":[10090],"speciesCommonName":"Mouse","speciesScientificName":"Mus musculus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN)","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001635.8","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000, Illumina HiSeq 4000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":156,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
