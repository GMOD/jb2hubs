UH is characterized as an abnormal protrusion of the abdominal contents to the umbilical region, causing pain, discomfort and reduced performance in pigs. To clarify the genetic basis of swine umbilical hernia, this study aimed to identify polymorphisms and genes associated with UH in pigs through the whole-exome sequencing and additional transcriptome data analyses","taxonomyId":[9823],"speciesCommonName":"Pig","speciesScientificName":"Sus scrofa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"EMBRAPA Swine and Poultry","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Transcriptome Sequencing, Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WTS, ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003025.6","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":20,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
