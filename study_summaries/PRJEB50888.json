As the disease is caused by mutations of CAVIN1, a molecule indispensable for lipid endocytosis and regulation, we complemented the vaccination cycle with a single dose of the Ad26.COV2 vaccine. Adenovirus-based vaccine entry is mediated by the interaction with adenovirus receptors and transport occurs in clathrin-coated pits. Ten days after Ad26.COV2 administration, S- and RBD-specific antibodies and high-affinity memory B cells increased significantly to values close to those observed in control Health Care Workers.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Bambino Gesu Children Hospital","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina NextSeq 500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
