By analysing population structure among individuals of different domestication status and geographic origin, we detected high levels of admixture, reflecting the reproductive biology of a self-incompatible, wind-pollinating  grass species. We then analysed patterns of recombination in overlapping subpopulations, which revealed substantial variation in the physical size of LR regions, with a tendency for larger LR regions in domesticated subpopulations.","taxonomyId":[4550],"speciesCommonName":"Rye","speciesScientificName":"Secale cereale","sourceType":"Germline","center":"IPK Gatersleben - Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_902687465.1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1397,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
