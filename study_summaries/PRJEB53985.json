The resultant hybrid forms appear as semi-domesticates and were somtimes considered as missing links between crops and their wild progenitors. Wild-growing barleys in Central and Asia, named Hordeum agriocrithon, show hallmark characters of both wild and domesticated forms.  77 wild barley accessions from the collection of the German Federal ex situ genebank hosted at IPK Gatersleben were chosen for genome-wide genotyping.
