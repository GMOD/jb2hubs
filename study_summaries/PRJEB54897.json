It can be implemented with any genome of choice. Users can modify different parameters to customise GBS setting, such as the choice of restriction enzyme and sequencing depth. By taking the gene-drop approach, users can also specify the demographic history and define population structure (by supplying a pedigree file). Like real sequencers, SimGBS will output data into FASTQ format.","taxonomyId":[9925],"speciesCommonName":"Goat","speciesScientificName":"Capra hircus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"AgResearch","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_001704415.1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":172,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
