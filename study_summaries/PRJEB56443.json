The factors driving the evolution of its virulence and adaptation in distinct geographic regions remain poorly characterized. Here, we utilize a long-read sequencing technology to develop a haplotype-resolved genome assembly of a US isolate of Pgt. A collection of haplotype-resolved Pgt assemblies is used as a reference genome representation to characterize the structural variation and single nucleotide polymorphisms in a diverse panel of re-sequenced Pgt isolates. Our study highlights the adaptive role of genomic variants and processes affecting the Pgt effector repertoire and creates a resource for detecting pathogen avirulence factors that might be exploited to prevent future epidemic outbreaks.","taxonomyId":[56615],"speciesCommonName":"Rust fungi","speciesScientificName":"Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Kansas State University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002762355.2","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":79,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
