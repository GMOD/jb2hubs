Musa balbisiana harbors many biotic and abiotic stress-tolerant characteristics and there is urgent need to integrate B-genomic regions into cultivars for various stress resistance, nutrition, and vigor characteristics in the new banana varieties. With the above objective GBS technology was applied to obtain SNPs on a unique population developed which was obtained crossing Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana. Here, in the current submission we deposit the SNPs identified in the mentioned population (AAxBB).","taxonomyId":[213592],"speciesCommonName":"Musa acuminata subsp. burmannicoides","speciesScientificName":"Musa acuminata subsp. burmannicoides","sourceType":"Germline","center":"ICAR - Indian Institute of Horticultural Research","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000313855.1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq X Ten","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":96,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
