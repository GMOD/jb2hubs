Sex was the key factor and the percentage of Tbet+CD11c+ IgD+CD27? activated naive B cells (aNAV) was higher in females compared to males.","taxonomyId":[10090],"speciesCommonName":"Mouse","speciesScientificName":"Mus musculus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"UTHSC","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001635.2","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":72,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
