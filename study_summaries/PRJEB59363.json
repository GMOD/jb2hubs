Six agronomic traits including natural plant height (nPH), natural leaf number (nLN), stem girth (SG), inter-node length (IL), length of the largest leaf (LL) and width of the largest leaf (LW) were measured in seven environments, spanning the period between 2018 and 2021. We firstly developed an integrated SNP-indel-SSR linkage map with 43,301 SNPs, 2,086 indels and 937 SSRs, which contained 7,107 bin markers mapped on 24 LGs and covered 3334.88 cM with an average genetic distance of 0.469cM. Based on this high-density genetic map, a total of 70 novel QTLs were detected for six agronomic traits by a full QTL model using the software QTLNetwork, of which 32 QTLs showed significant additive effects, 18 QTLs showed significant additive-by-environment interaction effects, 17 pairs showed significant additiveby-additive epistatic effects and 13 pairs showed significant epistasis-by-environment interaction effects. In addition to additive effect as a major contributor to genetic variation, both epistasis effects and genotype-by-environment interaction effects played an important role in explaining phenotypic variation for each trait. In particular, qnLN6-1 was detected with considerably large main effect and high heritability (h_a^2=34.80%). Finally, four genes including Nt16g00284.1, Nt16g00767.1, Nt16g00853.1, Nt16g00877.1 were predicted as pleiotropic candidate genes for five traits.","taxonomyId":[4097],"speciesCommonName":"Common tobacco","speciesScientificName":"Nicotiana tabacum","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002210045.1","platform":"BGISEQ-500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":274,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
