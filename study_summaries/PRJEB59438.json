Roots are the first organ to sense drought and adapt their growht to ensure minimum impact of drought on plant growht. We initiated the project to identify new QTL regulating root development in response to drought in barley seedlings. We carried out linkage mapping using 230 two-raw spring barley landraces whose origin covered Asia, Europe and Africa. The extracted genomic DNA was subjected to genotyping with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using the 50k Illumina Infinium iSelect SNP (Bayer et al. 2017; doi:10.3389/fpls.2017.01792). To identify new QTLs, three methods for genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used: GAPIT, BLINK and FarmCPU.","taxonomyId":[4513],"speciesCommonName":"Barley","speciesScientificName":"Hordeum vulgare","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Centre of Region Hana for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research, Czech Advanced Technology and Research Institute, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_904849725.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["PubMed:37077626"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":206,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
