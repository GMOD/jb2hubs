Thus the ordered combination or `phase? of alleles is known, making drones a valuable haplotype resource. We collated whole-genome sequence data for 1,407 drones, including 45 newly sequenced Scottish drones, collectively representing 19 countries, 8 subspecies and various hybrids. Following alignment to Amel_HAv3.1, variant calling and quality filtering, we retained 17.4 M high quality variants across 1,328 samples with a genotyping rate of 98.7%. We demonstrate the utility of this haplotype resource, AmelHap, for genotype imputation, returning >95% concordance when up to 64% of data is missing in haploids and up to 20% of data is missing in diploids. AmelHap will serve as a useful resource for the community for imputation from low-depth sequencing or SNP chip data, accurate phasing of diploids for association studies, and as a comprehensive reference panel for population genetic and evolutionary analyses.","taxonomyId":[7460],"speciesCommonName":"Honey bee","speciesScientificName":"Apis mellifera","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Roslin Institute","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_003254395.2","platform":"Illumina","url":"-","publications":["PubMed:37037860"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1328,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
