To identify the association between dietary retinol and CRC risk, we recruited 923 CRC patients and 1846 controls. Dietary retinol intake was assessed using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. For genetic analysis, genotype data were available for 1419 patients (600 cases and 819 controls) out of the total study population. Genomic DNA was extracted from participants? blood samples following the manufacturer?s instructions using the MagAttract DNA Blood M48 Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and BioRobot M48 automatic extraction equipment (Qiagen). SNP genotyping was performed using an Illumina MEGA-Expanded Array (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) including 123K SNPs.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"National Cancer Center Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.14","platform":"Illumina","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1464,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
