Here, it presented cold plasma contributed to the facilitated aldehyde inhibitors tolerance and ethanol fermentability of Zymomomnas mobilis. Genetic change was generated from cold plasma by genome resequencing assays. The key mutation would provide a robust strain biocatalyst for the production of biofuels and biochemicals.","taxonomyId":[264203],"speciesCommonName":"A-proteobacteria","speciesScientificName":"Zymomonas mobilis subsp. mobilis ZM4 = ATCC 31821","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Changzhou University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000007105.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":6,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
