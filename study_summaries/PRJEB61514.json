To understand the functional and prognostic impact of cancer-causing somatic mutations, we analysed the whole genomes and transcriptomes of 1,063 primary colorectal cancers in a population-based cohort with long-term follow-up. High quality transcriptome sequences from 1,063 tumours and 120 tissue normals enabled integration analyses of gene mutations and gene expression levels.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Somatic","center":"Uppsala University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.29","platform":"BGISEQ-500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1063,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
