Five of the individuals were tolerant to H.lataniae, and one was not tolerant to H. lataniae. Variants of interest were identified by calculating those that were the same in the five resistant variants and not in the susceptible variant. The regions of the genome analysed correspond to the capture sequence bait landing sites. these Capture-Seq baits were also ran across the avaliable germplasm collection atThe New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research.","taxonomyId":[3625],"speciesCommonName":"Golden kiwifruit","speciesScientificName":"Actinidia chinensis","sourceType":"Germline","center":"The New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_003024255.1","platform":"Illumina","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":6,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
