The population is representative of pan-European breeding progress across the years from 1830 to 2014. The dataset comprises gene expression data generated by RNA-sequencing data of six different tissues across a range of developmental stages with shallow whole genome shotgun sequencing to complement the RNA-sequencing data for variant calling.","taxonomyId":[4513],"speciesCommonName":"Barley","speciesScientificName":"Hordeum vulgare","sourceType":"Germline","center":"JHI","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing, Whole Transcriptome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS, WTS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_903970675.1","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1376,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
