This part of the PREPARE4VBD project aims to predict diseases susceptibilities of cattle with a different genetic background (Bos indicus versus Bos taurus) employing a blood-based ex vivo platform. Such a platform will be useful and in line with the 3R values to investigate and compare susceptibilities of defined cattle breeds.","taxonomyId":[9913],"speciesCommonName":"Cow","speciesScientificName":"Bos taurus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"University of Bern and Agroscope","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002263795.3","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":21,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
