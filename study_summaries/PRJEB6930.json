The missing data on chromosome 12 are being patched up and will be submitted at a later time together with the sex chromosomes. This data set is based on 20130502 sequence freeze and alignments; which were collected from 2504 unrelated individuals from 26 populations. The analysis was run using only Illumina platform sequence and only considered sequence with read lengths of 70bp or greater.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"EBI","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing, Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES, WGS","assembly":"GRCh37.p4","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.5","platform":"Illumina","url":"http://www.1000genomes.org/","publications":["PubMed:26432245"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2504,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
