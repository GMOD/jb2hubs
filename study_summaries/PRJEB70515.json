This abnormality is responsible for sterility or infertility, as well as increased risk of malignancy and thus is considered as important breeding and health issues. The aim of this project is comparative analysis of: (1) expression of genes encoding proteins or non-coding RNAs in the descended and undescended testes of unilateral cryptorchid dogs, (2) methylation status of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in descended and undescended testes and (3) frequency of DNA variants in coding sequence of the DEGs.","taxonomyId":[9615],"speciesCommonName":"Dog","speciesScientificName":"Canis lupus familiaris","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Poznan University of Life Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Department of Genetics and Animal Breeding, Poznan, Poland","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000002285.2","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
