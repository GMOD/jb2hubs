The structural variants uncovered by these datasets are a boon to genetic analysis in crop plants. The analysis comprises a core set of 1,000 genotypes selected from a universe of  22,626 barleys of the german ex-site genebank IPK and a total of 315 elite cultivars of European ancestry. Our findings support the notion that rapid evolution at structurally complex loci may have helped crop plants adapt to new selective regimes in agricultural ecosystems.","taxonomyId":[4513],"speciesCommonName":"Barley","speciesScientificName":"Hordeum vulgare","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_904849725.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1315,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
