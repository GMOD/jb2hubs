These will be based on obtaining the genome-wide sequence of 4000 samples from the Department of Twin Research and Genetic Epidemiology (TwinsUK) and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohorts (at 6x sequence coverage), and the exome sequence (protein-coding regions and related conserved sequence) of 6000 samples selected for extreme phenotypes. This project describes the variants identified from the ALSPAC study.
