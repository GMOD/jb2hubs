We called close to 5M sequence variants (SNPs, MNPs and indels) and noticed that the number of unique haplotypes had plateaued within this set of germplasm (1.7M tag SNPs). This data set proved highly accurate (98.6%) based on a comparison of called genotypes at loci shared with aSNP array.  We used this catalogue of SNPs as a reference panel to impute missing genotypes at untyped loci in data sets derived from lower density genotyping tools (150 K GBS-derived SNPs/530 samples). After imputation, 96.4% of the missing genotypes imputed in this fashion proved to be accurate. Using a combination of three bioinformatics pipelines, we uncovered ~92 K SVs (deletions, insertions, inversions, duplications, CNVs and translocations) and estimated that over 90% of these were accurate.","taxonomyId":[3847],"speciesCommonName":"Soybean","speciesScientificName":"Glycine max","sourceType":"Germline","center":"USDA-ARS, CICGRU","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000004515.4","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2500","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":102,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
