Surgically resected PDAC tumors and their paired PDOs from 21 patients were examined. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor tissue, organoids, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed to identify somatic mutations.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Erasmus University Medical Center","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.28","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":42,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
