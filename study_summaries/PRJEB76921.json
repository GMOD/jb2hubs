Tumor occurrences like this case are extremely rare, and being from a single case, the genetic information in all eight samples was identical, enabling the comparison of somatic mutations among histopathologically distinct tumors.","taxonomyId":[9615],"speciesCommonName":"Dog","speciesScientificName":"Canis lupus familiaris","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Veterinary Medicine, Chonnam National University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_011100685.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":8,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
