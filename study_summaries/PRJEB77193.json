SNPs. The collection is composed of wild, landraces and elite cultivars of soybean that were grown in East Asia or major soybean cultivating areas around the world.  comprehensive analysis of publicly available large-scale genome sequencing data of diverse cultivated accessions and the newly in-house sequenced wild accessions greatly increased the soybean genome-wide variation resolution. This could facilitate a variety of genetic and molecular-level analyses in soybean.","taxonomyId":[3847],"speciesCommonName":"Soybean","speciesScientificName":"Glycine max","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Donald Danforth Center, St. Louis, MO.","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000004515.4","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1511,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
