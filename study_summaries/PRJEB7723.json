Maize has a combination of life history, economic and societal value, and genetic tools that make it uniquely suited to studying genetic architecture. Additionally, the ability of molecular and population genetic polymorphism descriptors to aid identifcation of functional rare alleles is also a key outcome of this project as is the prediction of phenotype from genotype in diverse maize cultivars.","taxonomyId":[4577],"speciesCommonName":"Maize","speciesScientificName":"Zea mays","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Cornell University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Curation","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Curation","assembly":"B73 RefGen_v3","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000005005.5","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"http://panzea.org/","publications":["PubMed:24514905","PubMed:24587335","PubMed:23759205"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":17280,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
