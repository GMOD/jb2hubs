Here we report all genetic variants (SNPs) detected from whole genome sequencing of 96 Bangladeshi chickens ? 48 local village chickens (unimproved) and 48 improved chickens (improved by Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute, BLRI) belonging to the same indigenous breeds-Common Deshi, Hilly and Naked Neck.","taxonomyId":[9031],"speciesCommonName":"Chicken","speciesScientificName":"Gallus gallus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"The Roslin Institute,Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI)","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_016699485.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":96,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
