Here, it presented adaptive laboratory evolution with furan aldehydes contributed to the facilitated ethanol fermentability for Zymomomnas mobili. Genetic change was generated from adaptive laboratory evolution by genome resequencing assays. The key mutation would provide a robust strain biocatalyst for the production of biofuels and biochemicals.","taxonomyId":[542],"speciesCommonName":"A-proteobacteria","speciesScientificName":"Zymomonas mobilis","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Changzhou University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000007105.1","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
