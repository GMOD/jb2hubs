Therefore, it is particularly important to deeply analyze the genetic mechanism of teat number traits in pigs. In this study, we detected Single Nucleotide Ploymorphism(SNP), Insertion-Deletion(InDel) and Structural variant(SV) by whole-genome resequencing data, and selected teat number at birth and functional teat number as two types of teat number traits for genome-wide association study(GWAS) to reveal candidate genes associated with pig teat number traits.","taxonomyId":[9823],"speciesCommonName":"Pig","speciesScientificName":"Sus scrofa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Northwest A&F University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003025.6","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":560,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
