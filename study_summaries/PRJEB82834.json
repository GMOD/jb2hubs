Low read depth sites (<5), RNA edit sites, and low complexity regions (LCRs) were excluded. Common variants were filtered using 1000 genomes, gnomAD, and dbSNP data. Starting from hundred thousands of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (InDels), a thousand variants remained after filtering for each sample.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"DSMZ","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Transcriptome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WTS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.29","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":29,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
