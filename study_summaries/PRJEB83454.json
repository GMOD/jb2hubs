By leveraging genomic data, we seek to uncover genetic factors that influence key characteristics in this breed, enhancing breeding strategies and improving overall productivity. The findings from this study are expected to contribute valuable insights into the genetic basis of traits critical for livestock improvement.","taxonomyId":[9823],"speciesCommonName":"Pig","speciesScientificName":"Sus scrofa","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Array","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"Array","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000003025.6","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":2764,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
