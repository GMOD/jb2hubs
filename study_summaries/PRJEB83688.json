Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common genetic variants with small effects associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), the role of rare variants with large effects in MS etiology remains underexplored. We hypothesized that rare variants in MS-associated genes from GWAS studies (GWAS-associated genes) are more likely to contribute to familial MS (FMS) risk than to sporadic MS (SMS). Therefore, we aimed to assess the burden of rare, predicted pathogenic (RPP) variants in GWAS-associated genes in FMS and sporadic MS (SMS) patients compared to controls. Rare genetic variants in 111 GWAS-associated genes were assessed in 87 FMS, 89 SMS and 3866 control cases. We demonstrate that RPP variants were significantly overrepresented in the FMS cohort whereas their frequency was not increased in the SMS cohort compared to controls (p-values 5.27?10-74 and 1.00, respectively). Six genes (ALPK2, ANKRD55, INTS8, IQCB1, JADE2, and MALT1) significantly contributed to the burden of RPP in the FMS group. We conclude that rare variants in genes identified by GWAS might contribute to the genetic predisposition of familial MS patients.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Clinical institute of genomic medicine","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Exome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"ES","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.29","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":1,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
