Similar to most breeds, Duolang sheep typically produce one lamb per ewe per lambing, and genetic studies of this trait have largely relied on candidate gene approaches. To expand the genomic resources for this breed, we sequenced 299 genomes, generating approximately 11.3 trillion bases with an average coverage of 13.66X. Through high-quality alignments, with a mapping rate exceeding 99%, we identified 47,047,965 SNPs and 7,155,597 InDels. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 92 variants associated with litter size, including interesting genes such as DENND5B, ADGRB3, CCDC91, AGBL1, and MAGIX. This dataset provides a valuable genomic resource for studying genetic variants associated with litter size and serves as a foundation for genetic improvement efforts in Duolang sheep. Furthermore, the dataset supports broader research applications, including investigations into genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and breed-specific adaptations.","taxonomyId":[9940],"speciesCommonName":"Sheep","speciesScientificName":"Ovis aries","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Faculte de Medecine Veterinaire, Universite de Liege","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_016772045.2","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":297,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
