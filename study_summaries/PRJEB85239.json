Participants underwent high-intensity intermittent Wingate tests, with DNA samples collected for SNP analysis. Results showed that the MCT2 TAC haplotype was more prevalent in sprinters, correlating with increased lactate concentration differences and altered lactate clearance. The study highlights potential genetic biomarkers for sprinting performance while emphasizing the need for further research to explore underlying mechanisms and the complex influences on athletic performance.","taxonomyId":[9606],"speciesCommonName":"Human","speciesScientificName":"Homo sapiens","sourceType":"Germline","center":"European Variation Archive (EVA)","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Genotyping By Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"GBS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_000001405.15","platform":"-","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":337,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
