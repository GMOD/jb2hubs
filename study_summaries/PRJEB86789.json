By developing whole-genome molecular markers and functional molecular markers, designing liquid breeding chips, constructing databases for livestock and poultry genotypes, and developing algorithms and models for whole-genome selection, the project aims to build a high-throughput genotyping identification, analysis, and testing technology system. This system will support the creation of superior germplasm, breeding design, and cultivation, and enhance the application efficiency of core germplasm resources in breeding.","taxonomyId":[9925],"speciesCommonName":"Goat","speciesScientificName":"Capra hircus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"College of Animal Sciences","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_042835985.1","platform":"unspecified","url":"-","publications":["PUBMED:39279509","PUBMED:40157930"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":298,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
