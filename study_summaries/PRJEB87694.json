Although the study of genomes has progressed greatly, little is known about the genomes of the Butuo Black Sheep. In this study, we generated a high-quality chromosome-level genome yielded to be 2.95Gb with a contig N50 size of 71.45 Mb and scaffold N50 size of 92.26 Mb. The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog (BUSCO) analysis indicated the genome assembly to be 95.9% complete. The de novo genome prediction revealed that repetitive sequences constitute 47.74% of the entire genome, and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) constituted the largest portion. In addition, we report 50 sheep genomes generated by sequencing DNA samples on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, with a mean depth of 10.36X and 150 bp paired-end reads. In total, ~1.2 terabytes of raw data were generated, and 99.9% of the clean reads mapped successfully against the sheep reference genome assembly at a coverage of 99.6%. This BBS genome dataset provides valuable resources for studying genetic diversity and evolutionary pattern of BBS.","taxonomyId":[9940],"speciesCommonName":"Sheep","speciesScientificName":"Ovis aries","sourceType":"Germline","center":"Key Laboratory of Livestock Biology","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_016772045.1","platform":"Illumina HiSeq 2000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":50,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
