A total of 6 samples were collected for three different location of each breed, resulting 108 samples (6 breeds x 6 samples x 3 locations) and these samples were pooled into 18 samples (6 breeds x 1 pooled sample x 3 locations) based on locations for whole genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina short-read platform NovoSeq 6000, with quality assessment and preprocessing conducted using FASTQC and Trimmomatic. Reads were mapped to the Bos taurus reference genome (ARS-UCD2.0) using BWA-Mem, and variants were identified using DELLY (structural variants) and FreeBayes (SNPs, MNPs, and indels). The study focuses on detecting common immune-related genomic variations across breeds.","taxonomyId":[9903],"speciesCommonName":"Cattle","speciesScientificName":"Bos","sourceType":"Germline","center":"SASTRA Deemed University","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_002263795.4","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":24,"browsable":false,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
