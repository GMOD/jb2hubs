To ensure the timely development of forage cultivars adapted to specific agroclimatic conditions in a changing environment, we propose to shorten the breeding cycle using state-of-the-art analysis of the natural genetic variation in the species. Specifically, we propose to capture the maximal range of polymorphisms by whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of accessions of Napier grass with the project focus on the identification of molecular markers associated with drought tolerance, crude protein content, water soluble carbohydrates, self-incompatibility, disease resistance and frost tolerance traits. The generated data will be essential to spearhead and expand phenotype-genotype association studies by the scientific community at all levels.","taxonomyId":[154765],"speciesCommonName":"Cenchrus purpureus","speciesScientificName":"Cenchrus purpureus","sourceType":"Germline","center":"ILRI","material":"DNA","scope":"multi-isolate","type":"CONTROL","experimentType":"Whole Genome Sequencing","experimentTypeAbbreviation":"WGS","assembly":"-","assemblyAccession":"GCA_028749085.1","platform":"Illumina NovaSeq 6000","url":"-","publications":["-"],"numVariants":0,"numSamples":450,"browsable":true,"typeName":"Control Set"}]}]}
