Following that effort, a few other projects that focused at variant discovery of a particular breed or two. In this project we aim to identify and annotate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (INDELs), copy number variations (CNVs) and structural variations (SVs) in the genomes six horses of diverse genetic background using next generation sequencing.
