  "description": "Neisseria meningitidis Z2491 is a strain of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, which is a Gram-negative diplococcus that can cause meningococcal disease, a serious and potentially life-threatening illness. The Z2491 strain was isolated from a patient with meningococcal disease and has been extensively studied due to its importance in understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of meningococcal infections.\n\nNeisseria meningitidis is known for its ability to colonize the human nasopharynx, and in some cases, it can invade the bloodstream and cause meningitis or other severe manifestations of meningococcal disease. The Z2491 strain has been found to possess various virulence factors, such as the capsular polysaccharide, which helps the bacterium evade the host's immune response, and the Opa and Opc proteins, which facilitate adherence to and invasion of host cells.\n\nGenomic analysis of the Z2491 strain has revealed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity, providing valuable information for the development of diagnostic tools, preventive measures, and treatment strategies against meningococcal disease.",
