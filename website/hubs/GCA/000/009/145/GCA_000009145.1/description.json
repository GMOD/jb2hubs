  "description": "Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 is a species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that belongs to the genus Nitrosomonas. It is a gram-negative, obligate aerobic bacterium found in various environments, including soil, water, and wastewater treatment systems.\n\nNitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 is known for its ability to carry out the first step of nitrification, which is the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2−). This process is of great importance in the nitrogen cycle and is vital for the removal of ammonia from various ecosystems.\n\nThe cells of Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They possess a single polar flagellum, which enables them to move in their environment.\n\nNitrosomonas europaea ATCC 19718 is an obligate chemolithoautotroph, meaning it derives its energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, specifically ammonia, and uses carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source for growth and cell synthesis.\n\nThis species has been extensively studied for its role in nitrification processes, and it has been employed in various biotechnological applications, such as wastewater treatment and bioremediation of environments contaminated with ammonia.",
