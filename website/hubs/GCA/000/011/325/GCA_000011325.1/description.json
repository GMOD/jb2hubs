  "description": "Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is a widely used industrial microorganism known for its ability to produce large quantities of the amino acid L-glutamic acid, which is an important ingredient in various food and pharmaceutical products.\n\nThis strain, ATCC 13032, is the type strain of the species and has been extensively studied and used in industrial fermentation processes. Corynebacterium glutamicum is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It has an optimal growth temperature of around 30-34Â°C and can thrive in a variety of media and conditions.\n\nGenetically, C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 has a circular chromosome with a high GC content, typically around 53-54%. The genome of this strain has been sequenced and extensively studied, providing insights into its metabolic pathways, biosynthetic capabilities, and potential applications in biotechnology.\n\nDue to its ability to efficiently produce L-glutamic acid, C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 has become a model organism for the study of amino acid production and regulation. It is widely used in the industrial-scale production of various amino acids, organic acids, and other valuable compounds, making it an important microorganism in the field of biotechnology and industrial microbiology.",
