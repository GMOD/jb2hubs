  "description": "Methylorubrum extorquens CM4 is a species of pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophic bacteria. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium that can utilize one-carbon (C1) compounds, such as methanol and methylamine, as sole carbon and energy sources.\n\nMethylorubrum extorquens CM4 is characterized by its ability to grow on a variety of C1 compounds, including methanol, formaldehyde, and formate. It is known to possess a complex metabolic pathway for the oxidation of these C1 compounds, which involves a series of enzymatic reactions and the generation of energy through the process of oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from soil samples and has been found to be widely distributed in various environments, including aquatic habitats, plant surfaces, and soil. It is known to play a role in the global carbon cycle by contributing to the turnover of C1 compounds in the environment.\n\nMethylorubrum extorquens CM4 has been the subject of extensive research, particularly in the field of biotechnology, as it has the potential to be used in the production of various value-added chemicals and biofuels from renewable resources.",
