  "description": "Leuconostoc citreum KM20 is a lactic acid bacterium species that belongs to the Leuconostoc genus. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic coccus-shaped bacterium.\n\nLeuconostoc citreum KM20 is known to be associated with various food fermentation processes, particularly in the production of fermented vegetables, dairy products, and other fermented foods. It plays a crucial role in the development of flavor, texture, and preservation of these food products.\n\nThis species is capable of producing exopolysaccharides, which can contribute to the rheological properties and texture of fermented foods. Additionally, Leuconostoc citreum KM20 is known to be tolerant to various environmental stresses, such as low pH, high salt concentrations, and low temperatures, which enables it to thrive in diverse food production environments.\n\nThe genome of Leuconostoc citreum KM20 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, stress response mechanisms, and potential applications in the food industry and biotechnology.",
