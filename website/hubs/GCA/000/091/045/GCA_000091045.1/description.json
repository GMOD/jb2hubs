  "description": "Cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans JEC21 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a serious infectious disease called cryptococcosis, primarily in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nC. neoformans var. neoformans JEC21 is a basidiomycetous yeast that can reproduce both asexually, through budding, and sexually, through the formation of basidia and basidiospores. It is known to have two mating types, MATa and MATα, and the JEC21 strain is of the MATα mating type.\n\nThe cells of C. neoformans var. neoformans JEC21 are typically spherical or oval-shaped, with a characteristic polysaccharide capsule that is an important virulence factor, protecting the fungus from host immune responses. The strain JEC21 has been widely used in research to study the molecular mechanisms of cryptococcal pathogenesis, as well as the host-pathogen interactions involved in the development of cryptococcosis.",
