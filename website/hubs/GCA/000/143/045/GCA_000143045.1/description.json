  "description": "Globisporangium ultimum DAOM BR144 is a species of oomycete, a type of water mold that belongs to the family Pythiaceae. Oomycetes are a group of fungus-like organisms that are phylogenetically distinct from true fungi.\n\nGlobisporangium ultimum DAOM BR144 is a pathogenic organism that can infect a wide range of plant species, causing various diseases such as damping-off, root rot, and seed rot. It is considered an important plant pathogen and has been the subject of extensive research due to its economic impact on agriculture.\n\nThe species is characterized by the formation of globose (spherical) sporangia, which are the reproductive structures that release zoospores, the motile, asexual spores responsible for the dispersal and infection of the pathogen. Globisporangium ultimum DAOM BR144 can also produce sexual structures, such as oospores, which allow it to survive in the soil for extended periods.\n\nThis species is widely distributed and has been reported from various regions around the world, where it can persist in the soil and infect a diverse range of host plants, including agricultural crops, ornamental plants, and natural vegetation.",
