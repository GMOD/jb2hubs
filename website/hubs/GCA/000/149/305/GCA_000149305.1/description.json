  "description": "Rhizopus delemar RA 99-880 is a species of filamentous fungi belonging to the Mucorales order. It is a zygomycete fungus, known for its ability to produce various organic acids, including citric, fumaric, and malic acids.\n\nThis particular strain, Rhizopus delemar RA 99-880, has been studied extensively for its potential in industrial biotechnology applications, particularly in the production of these valuable organic acids. The strain is known to have a high citric acid yield and productivity, making it a promising candidate for large-scale fermentation processes.\n\nRhizopus delemar RA 99-880 exhibits a typical Rhizopus morphology, with a fast-growing, cottony, and fluffy mycelium. It produces sporangiophores, which are specialized reproductive structures that bear sporangia, containing the fungal spores. This species is often found in soil, decaying organic matter, and various food substrates.\n\nThe genomic and metabolic characteristics of Rhizopus delemar RA 99-880 have been extensively studied, providing insights into the genetic and biochemical pathways underlying its ability to produce organic acids efficiently. This knowledge can be leveraged to further optimize the strain's performance and enable its use in industrial-scale fermentation processes.",
