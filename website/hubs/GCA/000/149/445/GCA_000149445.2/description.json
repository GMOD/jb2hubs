  "description": "Candida albicans WO-1 is a species of yeast that is part of the Candida genus. It is a common commensal microorganism found in the human gut, oral cavity, and vaginal tract. Candida albicans WO-1 is known to be an opportunistic pathogen, capable of causing various types of candidiasis, such as oral thrush, vaginal yeast infections, and systemic candidiasis in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThis particular strain, WO-1, has been widely studied as a model organism for Candida albicans due to its ability to undergo phenotypic switching, a process that allows the yeast to adapt to different environmental conditions and host niches. The WO-1 strain has been observed to switch between a white, smooth colony morphology and an opaque, more elongated colony morphology, which is thought to be associated with different virulence factors and pathogenic potential.\n\nGenomic studies have revealed that the Candida albicans WO-1 strain has a diploid genome and exhibits a high degree of genetic and phenotypic diversity, which contributes to its adaptability and ability to colonize diverse host environments. Understanding the biology and pathogenesis of this strain has important implications for the development of effective antifungal therapies and the management of Candida-related infections.",
