  "description": "Coccidioides immitis H538.4 is a dimorphic fungus that belongs to the genus Coccidioides. It is a causative agent of a respiratory disease called coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever.\n\nCoccidioides immitis H538.4 is a soil-dwelling fungus that exists in two forms: a mycelial form in the environment and a spherical, endospore-producing form within the host. The mycelial form produces specialized reproductive structures called arthroconidia, which are small, airborne spores that can be inhaled by humans and animals, leading to the development of the disease.\n\nUpon inhalation, the arthroconidia transform into the spherical, endospore-producing form within the host's lungs. These spherules, or spherical structures, undergo internal division and eventually rupture, releasing hundreds of infectious endospores that can infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of infection.\n\nCoccidioides immitis H538.4 is primarily found in the southwestern United States, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley of California, as well as parts of Mexico and Central America. The infection caused by this fungus can range from mild, self-limiting respiratory symptoms to severe, disseminated disease, depending on the host's immune response and the inoculum size.",
