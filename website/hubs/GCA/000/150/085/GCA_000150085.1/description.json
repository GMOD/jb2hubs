  "description": "Coccidioides immitis RMSCC 3703 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Coccidioides. It is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it can exist in two different forms: a mycelial form and a spherical form called a spherule.\n\nThe mycelial form of Coccidioides immitis RMSCC 3703 grows in the soil and produces spores called arthroconidia, which can be easily dispersed by wind and cause infection in humans and animals. Once the arthroconidia are inhaled, they transform into the spherical form, the spherule, which is the parasitic form of the fungus.\n\nThe spherules grow inside the host's cells, eventually rupturing and releasing endospores, which can then infect other host cells. This cycle of growth and reproduction within the host is what causes the disease known as coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, in individuals who are exposed to this fungus.\n\nCoccidioides immitis RMSCC 3703 is primarily found in the southwestern United States, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley of California, as well as in parts of Mexico and Central and South America. It is an important pathogen that can cause significant health problems in susceptible individuals.",
