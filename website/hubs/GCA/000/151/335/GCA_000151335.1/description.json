  "description": "Coccidioides posadasii C735 delta SOWgp is a strain of the fungus Coccidioides posadasii, which is the causative agent of the infectious disease coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever. The 'delta SOWgp' designation refers to a specific genetic modification or deletion within the strain's genome, which likely impacts the expression or function of the Spherule Outer Wall Glycoprotein (SOWgp) - a key virulence factor for this fungus.\n\nCoccidioides posadasii is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it can exist in both a mycelial (filamentous) form and a spherical, spore-producing form called a spherule. The C735 designation likely refers to a specific isolate or laboratory strain of this fungus. This strain has been studied extensively as a model for understanding the biology, pathogenesis, and host-pathogen interactions of Coccidioides species.\n\nThe delta SOWgp modification in this strain may alter its ability to infect and colonize the host, potentially affecting its virulence or the host's immune response. Understanding the specific genetic and phenotypic characteristics of this strain can provide valuable insights into the fundamental biology and pathogenesis of coccidioidomycosis, which remains an important public health concern in certain regions.",
