  "description": "Trichophyton tonsurans CBS 112818 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Trichophyton, which is a group of dermatophytes responsible for various types of tinea infections, also known as ringworm, in humans and animals.\n\nTrichophyton tonsurans is a keratinophilic fungus, meaning it has the ability to degrade and utilize keratin, a structural protein found in the skin, hair, and nails. This fungus is commonly associated with tinea capitis, a scalp infection that can lead to hair loss and the formation of circular, scaly patches on the scalp.\n\nThe CBS 112818 strain of T. tonsurans is a reference or type strain that has been deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection, which is a renowned repository for fungal strains. This strain serves as a representative for the species and is often used in research, identification, and comparative studies.\n\nMorphologically, T. tonsurans CBS 112818 exhibits the typical characteristics of the Trichophyton genus, such as the production of septate hyphae and the formation of microconidia and macroconidia as reproductive structures. The specific growth patterns, colony morphology, and biochemical properties of this strain can provide valuable information for its identification and differentiation from other Trichophyton species.",
