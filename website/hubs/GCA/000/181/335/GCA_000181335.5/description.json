  "description": "Felis catus, commonly known as the domestic cat, is a small feline mammal that has been domesticated for thousands of years. It is a member of the Felidae family and is one of the most popular and widely-kept companion animals in the world.\n\nPhysically, Felis catus has a slender, agile body, retractable claws, and a flexible spine that allows it to execute swift, precise movements. Cats have acute senses, including excellent vision, hearing, and smell, which aid in their hunting and navigation abilities. They are obligate carnivores, meaning they require certain nutrients found primarily in animal-based foods.\n\nBehaviorally, domestic cats are known for their independent and solitary nature, as well as their playful, curious, and sometimes aloof personalities. They are adept at hunting small prey, such as rodents and birds, and can thrive in a variety of environments, from urban apartments to rural farmlands.\n\nFelis catus has a long history of coexistence with humans, and their domestication has led to the development of numerous distinct breeds, each with its own unique physical and behavioral characteristics. As companion animals, domestic cats provide companionship, emotional support, and entertainment for their human caretakers.",
