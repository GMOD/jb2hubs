  "description": "Giardia intestinalis, also known as Giardia lamblia or Lamblia intestinalis, is a flagellated protozoan parasite that infects the small intestine of humans and other vertebrates. The ATCC 50581 strain is a well-characterized isolate of this species.\n\nG. intestinalis ATCC 50581 is a unicellular, binucleated organism that exists in two distinct life stages: the infective cyst form and the replicative trophozoite form. The cysts are the dormant, environmentally resistant stage that can be transmitted through contaminated water or food. Once ingested, the cysts excyst in the small intestine, releasing the trophozoites, which then colonize the intestinal epithelium and reproduce by binary fission.\n\nTrophozoites of G. intestinalis ATCC 50581 are pear-shaped, approximately 12-15 Î¼m in length, and possess a ventral adhesive disc that allows them to attach to the intestinal walls. They have four pairs of flagella that facilitate their motility and feeding. The genome of this strain has been sequenced, providing insights into its unique cellular structures, metabolism, and mechanisms of pathogenesis.\n\nG. intestinalis ATCC 50581 is a significant cause of giardiasis, a diarrheal illness that can lead to malabsorption and other gastrointestinal complications in humans. Understanding the biology and pathogenesis of this well-studied strain has contributed to the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and preventive measures for this important public health concern.",
