  "description": "Coprinopsis cinerea okayama7#130 is a strain of the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, a species of inky cap mushroom. Coprinopsis cinerea is a saprotrophic fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter in its environment.\n\nThe strain Coprinopsis cinerea okayama7#130 was likely isolated from a specific geographical location, in this case, Okayama, Japan. Fungal strains can exhibit subtle genetic and phenotypic differences depending on their origin and environmental conditions.\n\nAs a member of the Coprinopsis genus, this strain possesses the characteristic morphology of inky cap mushrooms, including the deliquescent (liquefying) cap that breaks down into an inky black liquid as the mushroom matures. The numerical designation \"#130\" likely refers to a specific isolate or culture number within a collection or laboratory.\n\nCoprinopsis cinerea is a commonly studied model organism in mycology, the scientific study of fungi, due to its relatively simple lifecycle and genetic tractability. Research on this strain may contribute to our understanding of fungal biology, ecology, and potential applications in biotechnology or mycoremediation.",
