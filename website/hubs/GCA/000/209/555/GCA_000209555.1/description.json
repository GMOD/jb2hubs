  "description": "Oikopleura dioica is a species of free-swimming marine invertebrate known as a larvacean or appendicularian. It belongs to the phylum Chordata, which includes vertebrates and some invertebrates with a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits.\n\nOikopleura dioica is a small, transparent, barrel-shaped animal that typically measures a few millimeters in length. It has a distinct head, trunk, and tail, and possesses a complex filtering apparatus called a \"house\" that it uses to capture and consume microscopic plankton from the surrounding water.\n\nThe species is hermaphroditic, meaning each individual possesses both male and female reproductive organs. Reproduction involves the release of sperm and eggs into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The resulting larva undergoes a series of developmental stages before reaching adulthood.\n\nOikopleura dioica is an important component of marine ecosystems, playing a role in the cycling of organic matter and energy transfer within pelagic food webs. As a filter feeder, it helps to remove and process suspended particles, contributing to the overall productivity and nutrient dynamics of the ocean.",
