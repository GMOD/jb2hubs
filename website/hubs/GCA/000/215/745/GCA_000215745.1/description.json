  "description": "Klebsiella aerogenes KCTC 2190 is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Klebsiella genus within the Enterobacteriaceae family. This particular strain, KCTC 2190, was isolated and deposited in the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC).\n\nKlebsiella aerogenes is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause various infections in humans, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and septicemia, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The bacterium is known to be able to ferment a wide range of carbohydrates, producing gas as a byproduct, which contributes to its name \"aerogenes.\"\n\nThis species is commonly found in the environment, such as in soil, water, and on plant surfaces, and can also be part of the normal flora in the human gastrointestinal tract. Klebsiella aerogenes KCTC 2190 has been studied for its potential industrial applications, such as the production of biofuels and bioplastics, as well as its role in environmental bioremediation processes.",
