  "description": "Mortierella alpina ATCC 32222 is a species of filamentous fungus that belongs to the phylum Mucoromycota. It is a saprobic organism, meaning it primarily obtains its nutrients by decomposing organic matter in the environment.\n\nThis particular strain, ATCC 32222, was isolated from soil collected in Switzerland. M. alpina is known for its ability to produce significant quantities of the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid (ARA), which is an important precursor for the synthesis of various eicosanoids in animals.\n\nThe fungus grows as a dense, cotton-like mycelium on various media, and its hyphae are typically hyaline (transparent) and sparsely septate. Asexual reproduction occurs through the formation of sporangiospores within specialized reproductive structures called sporangia.\n\nM. alpina ATCC 32222 has been extensively studied for its potential commercial applications, particularly in the production of ARA, which has uses in the food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries.",
