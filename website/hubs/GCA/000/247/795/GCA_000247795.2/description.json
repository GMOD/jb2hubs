  "description": "Bos indicus, commonly known as the zebu or humped cattle, is a species of domestic cattle that originated in the Indian subcontinent. The key distinguishing features of Bos indicus are the presence of a prominent hump on the shoulders and the distinctive large, pendulous ears.\n\nBos indicus is well-adapted to hot and humid climates, thriving in regions with high temperatures and limited water availability. They are known for their tolerance to parasites, diseases, and environmental stresses, making them well-suited for tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nGenetically, Bos indicus is distinct from the other major domestic cattle species, Bos taurus, which originated in Europe and the Near East. Bos indicus is characterized by a smaller body size, shorter limbs, and a more docile temperament compared to Bos taurus.\n\nBos indicus plays a vital role in the agricultural and cultural traditions of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, where they are valued for their meat, milk, and as draft animals. Their adaptability and resilience have made them an important livestock resource in developing regions with harsh environmental conditions.",
