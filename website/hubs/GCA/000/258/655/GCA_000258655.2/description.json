  "description": "Pan paniscus, commonly known as the bonobo or the pygmy chimpanzee, is a species of great ape found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. Bonobos are one of the closest living relatives of humans, sharing approximately 98.7% of their DNA with humans.\n\nBonobos are medium-sized primates, typically weighing between 33 to 86 pounds (15 to 39 kilograms) and standing 24 to 33 inches (60 to 83 centimeters) tall. They have a slender, graceful build, with long legs and a relatively small head compared to other great apes. Bonobos are known for their distinct black facial features, including a prominent nose and large, expressive eyes.\n\nBehaviorally, bonobos are known for their peaceful, female-dominated social structure and their use of sex as a social mechanism to resolve conflicts and promote cooperation. They are primarily frugivorous, but also consume other plant matter, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nBonobos are considered an endangered species, with their population estimated to be around 15,000 to 20,000 individuals in the wild. They face threats from habitat loss, poaching, and civil unrest in their native range. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique and fascinating species.",
