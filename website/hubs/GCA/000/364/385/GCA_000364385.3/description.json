  "description": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, encapsulated, opportunistic pathogenic bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is a common inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal tract and is also found in the environment, such as in soil, water, and on plant surfaces.\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a significant cause of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who have undergone recent surgery or prolonged hospitalization. It can cause a range of infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections.\n\nThe bacterium's capsule is an important virulence factor, as it helps it evade the host's immune defenses and facilitates its adherence to host cells. Klebsiella pneumoniae is also known for its ability to develop resistance to a wide range of antibiotics, including carbapenems, which are often considered the last line of defense against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and pathogenicity of Klebsiella pneumoniae is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies, as it remains a significant public health concern, particularly in healthcare settings.",
