  "description": "Chlorocebus sabaeus, commonly known as the green monkey or West African vervet, is a species of Old World monkey native to West Africa. It is a member of the genus Chlorocebus, which includes several species of arboreal and semi-terrestrial monkeys.\n\nThe green monkey is characterized by its distinctive green-grey fur, which can vary in shade depending on the individual and its habitat. They have a distinctive black face with white fur around the eyes, nose, and mouth, giving them a distinctive facial appearance. The species is medium-sized, with adults typically weighing between 4 to 7 kilograms.\n\nGreen monkeys are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, including leaves, fruits, flowers, and seeds. They are known for their social behavior, living in large troops that can range from 10 to 50 individuals. These troops are typically led by a dominant female and consist of a complex social hierarchy.\n\nThe green monkey is considered a relatively widespread and adaptable species, found in a range of habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, savannas, and even urban areas. However, their populations have declined in some regions due to habitat loss, hunting, and other anthropogenic pressures.",
