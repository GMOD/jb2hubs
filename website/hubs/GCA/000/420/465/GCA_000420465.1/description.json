  "description": "Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 642 is a species of anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the genus Desulfovibrio. This Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacterium is found in various anaerobic environments, such as freshwater sediments, sewage, and the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and animals.\n\nDesulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 642 is a chemolithoautotrophic organism, meaning it can derive its energy and carbon from inorganic sources, such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The primary metabolic process of this bacterium is the reduction of sulfate to sulfide, which is a critical component of the global sulfur cycle.\n\nThis species is known for its ability to utilize a wide range of organic compounds, including lactate, pyruvate, and various amino acids, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 642 is also capable of producing hydrogen as a byproduct of its metabolic activities.\n\nThe genome of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans DSM 642 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, environmental adaptations, and potential applications in bioremediation and bioenergy production.",
