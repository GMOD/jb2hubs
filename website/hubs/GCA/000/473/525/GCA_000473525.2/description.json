  "description": "Anopheles melas is a species of mosquito that belongs to the Anopheles genus. It is a malaria vector, meaning it can transmit the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria in humans.\n\nAnopheles melas is primarily found in coastal regions of West Africa, particularly in areas with brackish or saline water habitats, such as mangrove swamps and estuaries. The larvae of this mosquito species typically develop in these types of aquatic environments.\n\nMorphologically, Anopheles melas is a medium-sized mosquito with a characteristic resting posture where the body forms an angle with the surface it is resting on. The species can be identified by specific patterns on its wings and legs.\n\nAnopheles melas is considered an important vector of malaria in the regions where it is found, as it can efficiently transmit Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of the malaria parasite. Its ability to thrive in coastal habitats and its vectorial capacity make it a significant public health concern in West Africa.",
