  "description": "Pseudogymnoascus destructans M1379 is a species of fungus that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus known to be the causative agent of White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats.\n\nThe fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans M1379 is characterized by its ability to grow and thrive in cold temperatures, typically between 0-20Â°C. It can form dense, white, cotton-like mycelia on the skin, muzzle, and wings of hibernating bats, leading to the distinctive \"white-nose\" appearance that gives the disease its name.\n\nThe fungus primarily infects and damages the delicate wing membranes of bats, disrupting their normal physiological functions and causing severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and ultimately, death. Pseudogymnoascus destructans M1379 is considered an important threat to bat populations, as it has been responsible for widespread declines in several North American bat species.\n\nResearch on this fungus has focused on understanding its biology, epidemiology, and developing effective management strategies to mitigate its impact on vulnerable bat populations.",
