  "description": "Naegleria fowleri is a free-living, single-celled, thermophilic (heat-loving) amoeba found in various aquatic environments, such as warm freshwater, soil, and geothermal water sources. It is known as the \"brain-eating amoeba\" due to its ability to cause a rare and severe form of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rapidly progressing and often fatal infection of the brain and central nervous system.\n\nThe life cycle of Naegleria fowleri includes three stages: a motile trophozoite stage, a temporary flagellate stage, and a dormant cyst stage. The trophozoite stage is the primary infective form, which can penetrate the nasal cavity, travel along the olfactory nerves, and reach the brain, where it can cause extensive tissue damage and inflammation.\n\nNaegleria fowleri thrives in warm, stagnant bodies of water, and outbreaks have been associated with activities such as swimming, diving, or nasal irrigation in contaminated water sources. The amoeba is not typically found in well-maintained, properly treated swimming pools or municipal water supplies.\n\nInfection with Naegleria fowleri is rare but often fatal, with a mortality rate of over 97%. Early diagnosis and prompt administration of antifungal and anti-inflammatory medications are crucial for improving the chances of survival. Public health efforts focus on raising awareness, promoting safe water practices, and monitoring for potential environmental sources of the amoeba.",
