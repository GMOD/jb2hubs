  "description": "Kwoniella heveanensis CBS 569 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, and order Tremellales. It was first isolated from soil samples collected from a rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation in Hevea, Thailand.\n\nThe cells of K. heveanensis CBS 569 are typically spherical to ovoid in shape, with a diameter ranging from 3 to 6 micrometers. The species can reproduce both asexually, through the formation of budding yeast cells, and sexually, through the production of basidiospores.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequence data have shown that K. heveanensis CBS 569 is closely related to other members of the genus Kwoniella, which are known to be found in diverse environments, including soil, plant material, and aquatic habitats.\n\nThe species is known to be capable of utilizing a variety of carbon sources for growth, including glucose, sucrose, and xylose, and it can tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, such as pH and temperature. However, its specific ecological role and potential biotechnological applications are still under investigation.",
