The garden strawberry is the result of a cross between two wild strawberry species, Fragaria virginiana and Fragaria chiloensis, and is a widely cultivated fruit crop.\n\nThe garden strawberry is a perennial herbaceous plant that produces runners, which are stems that grow along the ground and can develop new plants. The leaves are trifoliate, with each leaf composed of three leaflets. The flowers are white and have five petals, and the fruit is an aggregate accessory fruit, consisting of numerous small, single-seeded fruits called achenes, which are arranged on a fleshy, receptacle.\n\nThe garden strawberry is known for its sweet, juicy, and fragrant fruits, which are commonly consumed fresh, used in various desserts and preserves, or processed into products such as jams, jellies, and ice cream. It is an important commercial crop that is widely grown around the world, with significant production in regions with temperate climates.",
