  "description": "Equus przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's horse, is a rare and endangered species of wild horse native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is the last remaining true wild horse species, having never been domesticated.\n\nPrzewalski's horses are characterized by their stocky build, short legs, and a distinctive dun coat color with a dark dorsal stripe and zebra-like leg stripes. They stand approximately 12-14 hands high at the shoulder and weigh between 700-900 pounds. Their manes are short and erect, and they have a distinct, broad forehead.\n\nGenetically, Przewalski's horses are distinct from domestic horses, with 66 chromosomes compared to the 64 chromosomes of domestic horses. This species is adapted to the harsh, arid environments of the Mongolian and Chinese steppes, possessing exceptional endurance and the ability to survive on sparse vegetation.\n\nPrzewalski's horses are social animals, living in small family groups led by a dominant mare. They are grazers, feeding primarily on grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous plants. Their population declined drastically in the 20th century due to hunting and habitat loss, but conservation efforts have led to a slow recovery, with the species now classified as \"Endangered\" by the IUCN.",
