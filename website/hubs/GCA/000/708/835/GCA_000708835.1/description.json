  "description": "Klebsormidium nitens is a species of green algae that belongs to the class Klebsormidiophyceae. It is a filamentous, unbranched alga that is commonly found in terrestrial and freshwater environments, such as soil, rock surfaces, and damp habitats.\n\nThe cells of K. nitens are cylindrical, typically measuring between 5-15 μm in diameter and 10-50 μm in length. The cell walls are thin and the cells contain a single, parietal chloroplast that occupies a large portion of the cell volume. The chloroplast is typically cup-shaped and contains a single, distinct pyrenoid.\n\nReproduction in K. nitens occurs asexually through the formation of aplanospores, which are non-motile, thick-walled resting cells that can withstand adverse environmental conditions. Under favorable conditions, the aplanospores can germinate and give rise to new filaments.\n\nK. nitens is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental stresses, such as desiccation, high light intensity, and extreme temperatures. This adaptability allows it to thrive in diverse terrestrial habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling.",
