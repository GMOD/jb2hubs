  "description": "Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is a strain of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) that was isolated in 1917 by German physician Alfred Nissle. This probiotic strain is known for its beneficial properties and is widely used in the treatment and prevention of various gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nE. coli Nissle 1917 is a non-pathogenic, motile, and rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family. It is commonly found in the human gut microbiome and is considered a natural inhabitant of the human intestinal tract.\n\nThe unique characteristics of E. coli Nissle 1917 include its ability to produce antimicrobial substances, such as microcins, which help inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Additionally, this strain has been shown to modulate the immune system, enhance the production of anti-inflammatory compounds, and improve the integrity of the intestinal barrier.\n\nE. coli Nissle 1917 has been extensively studied for its probiotic properties and has been used in the treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and diarrhea. Its ability to promote a healthy gut microbiome and support the host's immune function makes it a valuable therapeutic agent in the field of gastroenterology.",
