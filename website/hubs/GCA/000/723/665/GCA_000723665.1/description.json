  "description": "Lichtheimia corymbifera JMRC:FSU:9682 is a species of fungus belonging to the phylum Mucoromycota, class Mucoromycetes, order Mucorales, and family Lichtheimiaceae. It is a filamentous, saprobic fungus commonly found in soil, decaying organic matter, and various other substrates.\n\nThe key characteristics of Lichtheimia corymbifera JMRC:FSU:9682 include:\n\n1. Hyphal growth: The fungus produces a network of hyaline, coenocytic (multinucleate) hyphae that can reach up to 10 μm in diameter.\n\n2. Sporangiophores: Erect, unbranched sporangiophores are produced, which can reach lengths of up to 1 mm and bear terminal sporangia.\n\n3. Sporangia: The sporangia are globose to subglobose in shape, with a diameter ranging from 30 to 80 μm. They contain numerous, small, globose to ellipsoidal spores.\n\n4. Zygospores: Under suitable conditions, the fungus can undergo sexual reproduction, forming zygospores as a result of the fusion of compatible gametes.\n\n5. Ecology and distribution: Lichtheimia corymbifera JMRC:FSU:9682 is a saprobic fungus commonly found in soil, decaying plant material, and other organic substrates. It has a widespread distribution, being reported from various regions around the world.\n\nThis species is of importance in the field of mycology and may have potential applications in biotechnology or as a model organism for studying the biology and ecology of Mucoromycota fungi.",
