  "description": "Sarcocystis neurona is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It is the causative agent of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), a serious neurological disease in horses.\n\nThe life cycle of Sarcocystis neurona involves two hosts: the definitive host, which is the opossum (Didelphis virginiana), and the intermediate host, which can include various mammals such as horses, cats, dogs, and other animals.\n\nIn the definitive host, the opossum, the parasite reproduces sexually and sheds oocysts in its feces. These oocysts can then be ingested by the intermediate hosts, where the parasite undergoes asexual reproduction, forming tissue cysts in various organs, including the central nervous system.\n\nWhen horses ingest the oocysts or tissue cysts, the parasite can infect the horse's central nervous system, leading to the development of EPM. Symptoms of EPM in horses can include ataxia, weakness, muscle wasting, and a variety of other neurological signs.\n\nSarcocystis neurona is an important pathogen in the equine industry, as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected horses. Understanding the life cycle and host-parasite interactions of this parasite is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for EPM.",
