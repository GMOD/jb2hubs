  "description": "Escherichia coli BW25113 is a well-studied laboratory strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli, a common inhabitant of the human and animal gut microbiome. This particular strain is a derivative of the K-12 lineage, which is widely used in genetic and molecular biology research.\n\nE. coli BW25113 is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium that is facultatively anaerobic, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It is a fast-growing, metabolically versatile organism that can utilize a variety of carbon and energy sources.\n\nThe BW25113 strain has been extensively genetically modified and engineered for various research purposes, such as the study of gene function, metabolic pathways, and the development of genetic tools. It is commonly used as a model organism in fields like microbiology, genetics, and biotechnology.\n\nNotably, the BW25113 strain lacks several key genes that are present in other E. coli strains, making it a valuable tool for researchers to investigate the role of these genes in cellular processes and overall bacterial fitness.",
