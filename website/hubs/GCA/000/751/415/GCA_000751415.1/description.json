It is known for its aggressive territorial behavior, particularly during breeding and spawning periods, when the fish will fiercely defend their nesting sites.\n\nThis species is of significant ecological importance in its native habitat, serving as a key component of the lake's food web. It is also widely kept in the aquarium trade, where it is prized for its vibrant coloration and unique appearance.",
