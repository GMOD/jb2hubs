  "description": "Vicugna pacos huacaya, commonly known as the huacaya alpaca, is a subspecies of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), a camelid native to the Andes mountains of South America. The huacaya alpaca is characterized by its dense, crimped, and wooly fleece, which is distinct from the smoother, more silky fleece of the suri alpaca, the other recognized subspecies.\n\nHuacaya alpacas are typically smaller in size compared to their suri counterparts, with males weighing around 150-200 pounds and females weighing 120-170 pounds on average. They have a compact, muscular build and a rounded, somewhat domed head. The huacaya's fleece can come in a wide range of natural colors, including white, black, brown, gray, and various shades of these hues.\n\nHuacaya alpacas are highly valued for their soft, hypoallergenic fiber, which is used in the production of high-quality textiles and clothing. They are well-adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andes, with their thick, insulating fleece and efficient water-conserving physiology. Huacaya alpacas are an important part of the cultural and economic fabric of the Andean region, where they have been domesticated and raised for centuries.",
