  "description": "Camelus bactrianus, commonly known as the Bactrian camel, is a large even-toed ungulate mammal native to the Central Asian region. It is one of the two extant species of camel, the other being the dromedary or one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nThe Bactrian camel is characterized by its distinctive two humps on its back, which serve as fat reserves that can be metabolized into water and energy when food and water are scarce. These humps are a unique adaptation that allows the Bactrian camel to thrive in the harsh, arid environments of the Gobi Desert and other parts of Central Asia.\n\nBactrian camels are well-suited to the extreme temperatures of their native habitat, with thick, woolly coats that provide insulation against the cold winters and ability to conserve water during the hot, dry summers. They are herbivorous animals, feeding on a variety of desert plants and grasses.\n\nGenetically, the Bactrian camel is distinct from its one-humped counterpart, with a diploid chromosome number of 74, compared to the dromedary's 74 chromosomes. This species is considered endangered, with wild populations declining due to factors such as habitat loss and hunting.",
