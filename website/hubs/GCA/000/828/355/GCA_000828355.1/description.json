  "description": "Sarcoptes scabiei is a species of mite that causes the skin condition known as scabies in humans and various other mammalian hosts. It is a microscopic, burrowing ectoparasite that belongs to the Acari class and the Sarcoptidae family.\n\nThe adult Sarcoptes scabiei mite is approximately 0.3-0.4 millimeters in size, with a rounded, flattened body and four pairs of short legs. The mite burrows into the upper layers of the host's skin, where it lays its eggs and creates tunnels or \"burrows.\" This burrowing activity and the release of allergens by the mites and their feces trigger an immune response, leading to the characteristic itchy skin rash associated with scabies.\n\nSarcoptes scabiei is highly contagious and can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated items, such as clothing, bedding, or furniture. The mites can survive off the host for a limited time, but they require a human or animal host to complete their life cycle and reproduce.\n\nScabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei is a significant public health concern, particularly in overcrowded living conditions and among vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, immunocompromised individuals, and those with poor hygiene or limited access to healthcare.",
