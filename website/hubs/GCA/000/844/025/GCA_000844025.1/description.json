  "description": "Equid alphaherpesvirus 1, also known as Equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), is a member of the Herpesviridae family, specifically the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects horses, donkeys, and other equids.\n\nEHV-1 is a significant pathogen in the equine industry, causing a range of clinical manifestations, including respiratory disease, abortion, and neurological disorders. The virus can establish a latent infection in the host, with the potential for reactivation and subsequent shedding, which can lead to the spread of the virus within equine populations.\n\nThe virus entry and replication process in host cells involves the binding of viral glycoproteins to cellular receptors, followed by the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane. Once inside the host cell, the viral DNA is transported to the nucleus, where it can either undergo lytic replication, leading to the production of new viral particles, or establish a latent state.\n\nEHV-1 is a significant concern in the equine industry due to its ability to cause outbreaks, which can result in significant economic losses and welfare issues for affected animals. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the virus's molecular mechanisms, developing effective vaccines, and improving diagnostic techniques to better manage and control EHV-1 infections in equine populations.",
