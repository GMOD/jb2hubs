  "description": "Propithecus coquereli, also known as Coquerel's sifaka, is a species of lemur endemic to the dry deciduous forests of northwestern Madagascar. It is a medium-sized primate, with an average body length of around 50 cm and a weight of approximately 3-6 kg.\n\nCoquerel's sifaka is characterized by its distinctive white or off-white fur, with a black face, hands, and feet. It has a long, bushy tail that it uses for balance during its unique, bipedal leaping locomotion. This species is known for its graceful and acrobatic movements, which it uses to navigate the complex canopy environment of its habitat.\n\nCoquerel's sifaka is a diurnal, arboreal primate that primarily feeds on leaves, fruits, and flowers. It lives in small social groups, typically consisting of a dominant pair and their offspring. The species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting pressure, and is protected under Malagasy law.\n\nOngoing conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and community-based initiatives, aim to ensure the long-term survival of this charismatic and ecologically important species within the unique ecosystems of northwestern Madagascar.",
