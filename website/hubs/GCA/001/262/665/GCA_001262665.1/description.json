  "description": "Eulemur flavifrons, commonly known as the Sclater's lemur or the yellow-fronted lemur, is a species of lemur found in the northeastern region of Madagascar. This primate belongs to the genus Eulemur, which is part of the family Lemuridae.\n\nSclater's lemur is a medium-sized lemur, typically weighing between 2.2 and 3.3 kg. It has a distinctive facial appearance, with a yellow or orange-colored forehead and crown, and a dark brown or black face mask. The body fur is generally reddish-brown or grayish-brown in color, with a paler underside.\n\nThese lemurs are primarily arboreal, spending most of their time in the canopy of the tropical forests they inhabit. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, including fruits, leaves, flowers, and occasionally small invertebrates.\n\nSclater's lemurs are known for their social behavior, living in small groups of 2 to 15 individuals, led by a dominant female. They communicate through a range of vocalizations, including grunts, barks, and whistles, and use scent marking to establish their territory.\n\nThe Sclater's lemur is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation in its limited range. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and community-based conservation programs, are underway to ensure the survival of this unique primate species.",
