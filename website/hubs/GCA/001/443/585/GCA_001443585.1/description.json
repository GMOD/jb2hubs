  "description": "Acinonyx jubatus, commonly known as the cheetah, is a large feline species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is the fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds up to 120 km/h (75 mph) during short bursts.\n\nCheetahs have a slender, streamlined body with a small head, long legs, and a long, muscular tail that provides balance and agility during high-speed chases. Their coat is a tawny yellow color with black spots, which provides camouflage in the savanna and grassland habitats they inhabit.\n\nCheetahs are obligate carnivores, feeding primarily on medium-sized hoofed animals such as gazelles, impalas, and hares. They are social and often hunt in small family groups, using their exceptional speed and agility to outmaneuver their prey.\n\nAcinonyx jubatus is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with populations declining due to habitat loss, conflict with humans, and declining prey populations. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their remaining habitats and managing human-wildlife conflicts to ensure the long-term survival of this iconic African predator.",
