  "description": "Mus musculus castaneus, commonly known as the Castaneus mouse or the Southeast Asian house mouse, is a subspecies of the house mouse (Mus musculus) that is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small rodent that belongs to the family Muridae.\n\nThe Castaneus mouse is characterized by its medium-sized build, with a typical body length of around 8-10 cm and a tail length of 7-10 cm. Its fur is generally brownish-gray in color, with a slightly reddish-brown or chestnut hue, which gives the subspecies its name. The ears and feet are typically lighter in color compared to the rest of the body.\n\nMus musculus castaneus is primarily found in countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and parts of China, where it inhabits a variety of habitats, including urban areas, agricultural lands, and natural environments. It is known to be an opportunistic feeder, consuming a wide range of food sources, including grains, seeds, insects, and small invertebrates.\n\nAs a subspecies of the house mouse, Mus musculus castaneus shares many behavioral and ecological characteristics with its more widely distributed counterparts. It is known to be a prolific breeder, with females capable of producing several litters per year, and it is often considered a pest species due to its ability to thrive in close proximity to human settlements and its potential to cause damage to agricultural crops and stored food.\n\nThe Castaneus mouse is of interest to researchers in the fields of genetics, evolutionary biology, and animal behavior, as it provides insights into the diversification and adaptation of the house mouse within its native Southeast Asian range.",
