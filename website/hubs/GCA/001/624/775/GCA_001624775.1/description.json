It is a small, nocturnal rodent with a slender body, large ears, and a long, scaly tail.\n\nThe house mouse is one of the most widely distributed mammals in the world, thriving in close association with humans and often found in human dwellings, such as homes, farms, and other buildings. It is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a variety of plant and animal materials, including grains, seeds, fruits, and insects.\n\nMus musculus musculus is known for its adaptability and prolific breeding, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year. The species is considered an important model organism in scientific research, particularly in the fields of genetics, developmental biology, and biomedical research.\n\nThis subspecies is typically light brown or gray in color, with a slightly paler underside. It has a keen sense of hearing and a well-developed sense of smell, which aids in its survival and navigation within its environment. The house mouse is an important component of many ecosystems, serving as a prey species for various predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores.",
