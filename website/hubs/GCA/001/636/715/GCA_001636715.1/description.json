  "description": "Ascosphaera apis ARSEF 7405 is a fungal species that belongs to the family Ascosphaeraceae. It is an obligate parasite of the honey bee (Apis species), causing a disease known as chalkbrood in honey bee larvae.\n\nThe key features of this species are:\n\n1. Spore formation: Ascosphaera apis produces spore-filled fruiting bodies called ascocarps, which contain ascospores. These ascospores are the infectious stage of the fungus.\n\n2. Pathogenicity: When honey bee larvae ingest the ascospores, the fungus germinates and penetrates the larval tissues, eventually killing the host.\n\n3. Morphology: The ascocarps of Ascosphaera apis are spherical, with a black, brittle outer layer. The ascospores are elliptical in shape and measure around 3-4 Î¼m in diameter.\n\n4. Genetic Identification: The ARSEF 7405 strain is a specific isolate of Ascosphaera apis, which has been studied and characterized genetically. This strain was obtained from the USDA Agricultural Research Service Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF).\n\nOverall, Ascosphaera apis ARSEF 7405 is an important fungal pathogen of honey bees, causing significant economic and ecological impacts on managed and wild bee populations.",
