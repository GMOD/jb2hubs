  "description": "Okapia johnstoni, commonly known as the okapi, is a species of giraffe-like mammal that is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Central Africa. It is the only living relative of the giraffe and the sole member of the genus Okapia.\n\nThe okapi is a medium-sized, solitary, and largely nocturnal or crepuscular animal. It has a distinctive appearance, with a long, prehensile tongue, a short, muscular neck, and large, rounded ears. Its body is covered in a reddish-brown coat, with distinctive black-and-white striped legs and hindquarters, which serve as a camouflage in the dense forest habitat.\n\nOkapis are herbivores, feeding primarily on leaves, shoots, and other vegetation found in the tropical rainforests of their native range. They are well-adapted to their environment, with specialized digestive systems and unique physiological features that allow them to thrive in the dense, humid forests.\n\nConservation-wise, the okapi is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, poaching, and other threats. Efforts are underway to protect the remaining populations and their fragile forest habitats through various conservation initiatives and community-based programs.",
