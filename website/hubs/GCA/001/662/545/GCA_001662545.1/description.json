  "description": "Rosa x damascena, commonly known as the Damask rose, is a hybrid rose species that is believed to have originated in the Middle East. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. The plant has gray-green, pinnately compound leaves and bears fragrant, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink.\n\nThe Damask rose is characterized by its unique scent, which is often described as sweet, floral, and slightly spicy. This fragrance is primarily due to the presence of volatile organic compounds, such as citronellol, geraniol, and linalool, within the rose's petals.\n\nHistorically, the Damask rose has been extensively cultivated for the production of rose oil and rose water, which have been used in perfumes, cosmetics, and traditional medicines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is widely grown in gardens and landscapes.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, the Damask rose is classified as a hybrid species, with its exact parentage still a matter of debate among botanists. It is believed to have been derived from a cross between the Gallica rose (Rosa gallica) and the Moschata rose (Rosa moschata).",
