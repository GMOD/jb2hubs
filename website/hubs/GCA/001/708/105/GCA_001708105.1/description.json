  "description": "Komagataella pastoris, formerly known as Pichia pastoris, is a species of yeast that is widely used in biotechnology and research. It is a methylotrophic yeast, meaning it can utilize methanol as a sole carbon and energy source.\n\nSome key scientific characteristics of Komagataella pastoris:\n\n1. Taxonomy: Komagataella pastoris belongs to the kingdom Fungi, phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, order Saccharomycetales, and family Pichiaceae.\n\n2. Cell morphology: K. pastoris cells are typically oval or spherical in shape, with a diameter ranging from 2-5 micrometers.\n\n3. Reproduction: K. pastoris reproduces asexually through budding, a process in which a new cell is formed as an outgrowth from the parent cell.\n\n4. Metabolism: As a methylotrophic yeast, K. pastoris can efficiently utilize methanol as a carbon and energy source. It also has the ability to grow on a variety of other carbon sources, such as glucose, glycerol, and ethanol.\n\n5. Genetic features: K. pastoris has a relatively small genome size, making it an attractive host for heterologous protein production. It has been extensively engineered for the expression of a wide range of recombinant proteins.\n\n6. Applications: K. pastoris is widely used in biotechnology and research due to its ability to produce high levels of recombinant proteins, its ease of genetic manipulation, and its capacity for post-translational modifications similar to those found in higher eukaryotic cells.\n\nOverall, Komagataella pastoris is a well-studied and versatile yeast species that has become a valuable tool in the fields of molecular biology, protein engineering, and biotechnology.",
