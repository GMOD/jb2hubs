  "description": "Cryptococcus depauperatus CBS 7841 is a species of yeast belonging to the genus Cryptococcus. It is a basidiomycetous yeast, meaning it belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, which is one of the major fungal phyla.\n\nCryptococcus depauperatus CBS 7841 is a haploid, asexual yeast that reproduces primarily through budding. It is a non-pigmented, round to oval-shaped yeast that typically measures between 5-10 micrometers in diameter.\n\nThis species was initially isolated from an environmental sample and has been deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection under the strain number CBS 7841. The CBS strain collection is a valuable resource for studying and identifying different fungal species.\n\nCryptococcus depauperatus CBS 7841 has been studied for its potential biotechnological applications, as some Cryptococcus species have been found to produce useful compounds or exhibit interesting metabolic capabilities. However, the specific characteristics and potential applications of this particular strain are not well-documented in the available scientific literature.",
