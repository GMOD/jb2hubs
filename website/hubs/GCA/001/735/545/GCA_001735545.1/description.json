  "description": "Phormia regina, commonly known as the black blowfly or the blue bottle fly, is a species of blow fly that belongs to the family Calliphoridae. These flies are found throughout North America and Europe, and they play a crucial role in the ecosystem as decomposers and pollinators.\n\nPhormia regina is a medium-sized fly, typically measuring around 8-12 millimeters in length. They have a distinct metallic blue or green coloration on their thorax and abdomen, which gives them their distinctive appearance. The flies possess compound eyes, a single pair of wings, and a proboscis that they use to feed on a variety of organic matter, including decaying plant and animal matter.\n\nThe life cycle of Phormia regina includes four distinct stages: egg, larva (maggot), pupa, and adult. The female flies lay their eggs on decomposing organic matter, such as carrion or rotting plant material. The larvae that hatch from the eggs feed on the decaying matter, playing a crucial role in the decomposition process. After the larval stage, the flies undergo a pupal stage before emerging as adult flies.\n\nPhormia regina is of particular interest to forensic scientists, as the presence and developmental stage of the larvae found on a decomposing body can provide valuable information about the time of death and other aspects of a crime scene investigation. Additionally, these flies are important pollinators, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem balance in their habitats.",
