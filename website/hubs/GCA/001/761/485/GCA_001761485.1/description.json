  "description": "Yarrowia lipolytica is a species of yeast that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a non-conventional yeast known for its versatility and unique metabolic capabilities.\n\nYarrowia lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast, meaning it can exhibit both unicellular and filamentous growth forms. It is capable of growing on a wide range of carbon sources, including hydrophobic substrates such as alkanes, fatty acids, and triglycerides, making it a valuable model organism for the study of lipid metabolism.\n\nThis yeast species is often found in environments with high lipid content, such as dairy products, oily wastewater, and industrial waste streams. It has been extensively studied for its potential applications in the production of various value-added compounds, including single-cell oils, organic acids, enzymes, and heterologous proteins.\n\nYarrowia lipolytica is recognized for its robust growth, high tolerance to environmental stresses, and ability to secrete a variety of extracellular enzymes. These characteristics have led to its use in various biotechnological processes, including bioremediation, biofuel production, and the development of microbial cell factories for the synthesis of industrially relevant molecules.",
