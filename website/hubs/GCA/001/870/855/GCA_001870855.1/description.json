  "description": "Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus, commonly known as the greater prairie-chicken, is a species of grouse native to the central United States. It is a member of the genus Tympanuchus, which includes several species of prairie-chickens.\n\nThe greater prairie-chicken is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring between 16 to 18 inches in length. It has a distinctive appearance, with a rounded body, short, rounded wings, and a small, hooked beak. The male of the species is known for its unique mating display, which involves inflating its bright orange air sacs on the sides of its neck and emitting a series of loud, booming calls.\n\nEcologically, the greater prairie-chicken is a grassland-dependent species, inhabiting native prairies, pastures, and other open, grassy habitats. It is an important component of the prairie ecosystem, serving as a prey species for various predators and playing a role in the overall biodiversity of the region.\n\nUnfortunately, the greater prairie-chicken has faced significant population declines due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as other human-induced factors. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore the species' remaining populations and their critical habitats.",
