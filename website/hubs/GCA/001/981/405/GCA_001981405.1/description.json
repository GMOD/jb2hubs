  "description": "Spirodela polyrhiza, commonly known as the common duckweed or greater duckweed, is a small, free-floating aquatic plant species that belongs to the family Lemnaceae. It is considered one of the smallest flowering plants in the world, with individual plants typically measuring less than 10 millimeters in diameter.\n\nSpirodela polyrhiza is characterized by its round, disc-like fronds (leaves) that are green in color and have a reddish-purple underside. The plant is distinguished by the presence of multiple, long, unbranched roots that hang down from the underside of the fronds, which is a distinctive feature compared to other duckweed species.\n\nThis species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It reproduces both sexually, through the production of small flowers and seeds, and asexually, through the formation of new daughter fronds from the parent plant.\n\nSpirodela polyrhiza plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems, serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms, including fish, waterfowl, and invertebrates. Additionally, it is known for its ability to absorb and remove nutrients, making it useful in water treatment and bioremediation applications.",
