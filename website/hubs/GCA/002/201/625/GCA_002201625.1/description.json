  "description": "Euglossa dilemma, also known as the orchid bee, is a species of solitary bee found in tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Apidae, which includes various types of bees and wasps.\n\nEuglossa dilemma is a medium-sized bee, typically measuring around 10-12 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive metallic green or blue-green coloration on its body, which can appear iridescent in certain lighting conditions. The species is known for its unique behavior of collecting fragrances from various orchid species, which it uses to attract potential mates.\n\nThese bees are solitary, with each female constructing its own nest, typically in the cavities of trees or other structures. The nests are composed of a series of cells made from resin and other natural materials, within which the female lays her eggs. The larvae develop and undergo metamorphosis within these cells, emerging as adult bees.\n\nEuglossa dilemma plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator, contributing to the reproduction of various plant species, particularly orchids. The species' dependence on specific orchid fragrances for mating rituals also highlights the intricate relationships between insects and their plant counterparts in these complex tropical environments.",
