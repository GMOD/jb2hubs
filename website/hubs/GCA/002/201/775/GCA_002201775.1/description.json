  "description": "Ammotragus lervia, commonly known as the Barbary sheep or aoudad, is a species of wild mountain sheep native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is the only surviving member of the genus Ammotragus.\n\nThe Barbary sheep is a large, muscular sheep with a distinctive shaggy coat that can range in color from light to dark brown. Adult males, known as rams, can weigh up to 300 pounds (136 kg) and stand up to 3.5 feet (1.1 m) tall at the shoulder. Females, or ewes, are smaller, typically weighing around 200 pounds (91 kg).\n\nThis species is well-adapted to the rugged, arid environments of its native habitat, with specialized hooves that provide traction on steep, rocky terrain. Barbary sheep are known for their impressive horns, which can grow up to 30 inches (76 cm) long in males.\n\nBarbary sheep are social animals, living in herds of up to 20 individuals led by a dominant female. They are primarily herbivores, feeding on a variety of grasses, shrubs, and woody plants. Their populations have declined in the wild due to hunting and habitat loss, leading to their classification as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
