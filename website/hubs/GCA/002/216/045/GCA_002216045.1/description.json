  "description": "Pinctada imbricata, commonly known as the Atlantic pearl oyster or winged pearl oyster, is a species of saltwater clam, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Pteriidae. This species is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from North Carolina, USA, to Brazil.\n\nPinctada imbricata is a pearl-producing oyster, with the ability to produce both natural and cultured pearls. The shell is typically oval-shaped, with a rough, scaly exterior and a smooth, pearly interior. The species can grow up to 15 cm in length and is known for its distinctive \"winged\" appearance, with small projections extending from the shell.\n\nPinctada imbricata is an important species in the pearl farming industry, as it is a primary source of natural and cultured pearls in the western Atlantic region. The species is also an important component of the local ecosystem, serving as a food source for various marine predators and playing a role in the filtration of seawater.",
