  "description": "Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis, commonly known as the Sumatran rhinoceros, is a subspecies of the Sumatran rhinoceros that is native to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is one of the smallest and most critically endangered rhinoceros species in the world.\n\nThe Sumatran rhinoceros is characterized by its small size, with an average height of 1.5 to 1.7 meters at the shoulder and a weight ranging from 800 to 1,000 kilograms. It has two horns, with the front horn being larger than the rear horn. The skin of the Sumatran rhinoceros is reddish-brown in color and is covered in a thick, bristly coat that helps to protect it from the dense tropical forests it inhabits.\n\nThe Sumatran rhinoceros is a solitary and elusive animal, living primarily in the dense, mountainous forests of Sumatra. It is primarily a browser, feeding on a variety of plant species, including leaves, shoots, and fruits. The species is known to be highly territorial and aggressive, particularly during mating and breeding seasons.\n\nUnfortunately, the Sumatran rhinoceros is critically endangered, with only a few dozen individuals remaining in the wild. The primary threats to the species include habitat loss, poaching for its horns, and low reproductive rates. Conservation efforts, including anti-poaching patrols and habitat protection, are ongoing to try to save this unique and charismatic species from extinction.",
