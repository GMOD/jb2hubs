  "description": "Pan troglodytes, commonly known as the common chimpanzee or simply the chimpanzee, is a species of great ape native to the tropical forests and savannas of Africa. Chimpanzees are our closest living relatives, sharing approximately 98.8% of their DNA with humans.\n\nChimpanzees are highly intelligent and social primates, living in complex communities with sophisticated communication and social hierarchies. They are known for their tool use, problem-solving abilities, and cultural traditions, which are passed down through generations. Chimpanzees are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and occasionally small mammals.\n\nThese primates are characterized by their long arms, which can span up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) when fully extended, and their opposable thumbs, which allow for dexterous manipulation of objects. Chimpanzees are typically covered in dark hair, with a prominent brow ridge and a protruding muzzle.\n\nPan troglodytes is classified into four subspecies, each with its own unique distribution and characteristics. The subspecies are: P. t. verus (Western chimpanzee), P. t. ellioti (Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee), P. t. troglodytes (Central chimpanzee), and P. t. schweinfurthii (Eastern chimpanzee).\n\nChimpanzees are considered endangered due to habitat loss, hunting, and disease. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these remarkable primates and maintain the ecological balance of their natural habitats.",
