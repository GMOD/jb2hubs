  "description": "Ambystoma mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican axolotl or ajolote, is a species of neotenic mole salamander endemic to Lake Xochimilco in Mexico City. This unique amphibian is known for its ability to regenerate lost body parts, including limbs, tail, and even parts of the brain and heart.\n\nThe Mexican axolotl is a large, fully aquatic salamander that can grow up to 30 cm in length. It has a distinctive, tadpole-like appearance with a broad, flattened head, a long, slender body, and four limbs with digits. The axolotl's external gills, which extend from the sides of its head, are a prominent feature and allow it to breathe underwater.\n\nUnlike many other salamanders, the Mexican axolotl retains its larval characteristics throughout its life, a phenomenon known as neoteny. This means it does not undergo a typical metamorphosis to an adult, terrestrial form, but instead remains in its juvenile, aquatic state.\n\nThe axolotl is of great scientific interest due to its remarkable regenerative abilities. It can regenerate lost limbs, spinal cord, and even parts of the brain and heart, making it a valuable model organism for the study of tissue regeneration and stem cell biology.\n\nUnfortunately, the Mexican axolotl is classified as Critically Endangered due to habitat loss, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species in its native Lake Xochimilco. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and fascinating amphibian.",
