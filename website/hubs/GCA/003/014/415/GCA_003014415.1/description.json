  "description": "Candidozyma auris is a species of yeast that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum of fungi. It was originally isolated from the ear canal of a human patient.\n\nThe key characteristics of Candidozyma auris are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Candidozyma auris cells are oval to round in shape, typically 3-6 μm in diameter, and reproduce by budding.\n\n2. Colony appearance: On agar plates, the colonies of C. auris are smooth, cream-colored, and pasty in texture.\n\n3. Physiology: C. auris is a thermotolerant yeast, capable of growing at temperatures up to 42°C. It can assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose.\n\n4. Identification: Biochemical tests and molecular techniques, such as sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA, are commonly used to identify and differentiate C. auris from other Candida species.\n\n5. Clinical significance: C. auris has emerged as an important human pathogen, causing invasive infections, particularly in healthcare settings. It has shown resistance to multiple antifungal drugs, making it a significant threat to public health.\n\nOverall, Candidozyma auris is a medically relevant yeast species that has gained attention due to its ability to cause severe infections and its increasing resistance to commonly used antifungal therapies.",
