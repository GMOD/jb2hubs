  "description": "Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis, also known as the East Asian finless porpoise, is a subspecies of the finless porpoise found in the coastal waters of eastern Asia. It is a small, stout-bodied cetacean that lacks a dorsal fin, a characteristic feature of the finless porpoise species.\n\nThe East Asian finless porpoise is typically gray or brownish-gray in color, with a lighter underside. It has a rounded, blunt head and small, triangular flippers. The species is known to inhabit shallow, coastal waters, estuaries, and rivers, primarily in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and the Yangtze River. They feed primarily on small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nThis subspecies is considered Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to various threats, including habitat loss, pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and vessel strikes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and vulnerable marine mammal.",
