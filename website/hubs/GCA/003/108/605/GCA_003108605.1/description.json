  "description": "Poliovirus 2 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects human cells, targeting the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system.\n\nPoliovirus 2 is one of the three serotypes of the poliovirus, with the other two being Poliovirus 1 and Poliovirus 3. The virus enters the host through the oral route and can cause the disease poliomyelitis, which can lead to various degrees of paralysis, including permanent disability or even death.\n\nThe genome of Poliovirus 2 consists of approximately 7,500 nucleotides, encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved into the structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly. The virus uses the host cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material and produce new viral particles, which can then infect other host cells.\n\nPoliovirus 2 has been the target of global eradication efforts, with the World Health Organization (WHO) working towards the complete elimination of all three poliovirus serotypes. Effective vaccines, along with improved sanitation and public health measures, have significantly reduced the incidence of poliomyelitis worldwide.",
