  "description": "Phascolarctos cinereus, commonly known as the koala, is a tree-dwelling marsupial species native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Phascolarctidae and is the only extant member of the genus Phascolarctos.\n\nThe koala is characterized by its unique adaptations to its arboreal lifestyle. It has a stocky, rounded body, large eyes, and a small, rounded head with a short snout. Its limbs are adapted for climbing, with sharp claws and a grasping ability that allows it to move efficiently through the tree canopy. The koala's diet consists almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, which it can efficiently digest due to specialized digestive adaptations, including a large, sacculated cecum and a slow metabolic rate.\n\nKoalas are generally solitary animals, with each individual maintaining a home range that it defends against conspecifics. They communicate through a range of vocalizations, including bellows, growls, and bawls, and their social interactions are primarily limited to mating and maternal care.\n\nThe koala is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and other human-induced threats. Conservation efforts, including habitat protection and management, are essential for the long-term survival of this iconic Australian species.",
