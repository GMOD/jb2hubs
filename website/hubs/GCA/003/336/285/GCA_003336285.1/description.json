  "description": "Mus spicilegus, commonly known as the Steppe Mouse or Steppe Field Mouse, is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Mus. It is native to central and eastern Europe, spanning from the Balkans to the Ural Mountains.\n\nThe Steppe Mouse is a small, stocky rodent with a body length of approximately 8-12 cm and a tail length of 6-9 cm. Its fur is typically grayish-brown on the upper parts and whitish-gray on the underside. The species is characterized by its small, rounded ears and a relatively short, scaly tail.\n\nMus spicilegus is primarily a burrowing species, constructing elaborate underground nests known as \"haystacks\" or \"thatched mounds\" for overwintering. These structures can reach up to a meter in height and serve as a communal shelter for the mice, as well as a storage facility for food resources.\n\nThe Steppe Mouse is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a variety of plant material, such as seeds, grains, and vegetation, as well as small invertebrates. It is an important prey species for a range of predators, including birds of prey, carnivorous mammals, and snakes.\n\nThis species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, with stable populations throughout its range. However, habitat loss and fragmentation due to agricultural expansion and urbanization can pose potential threats to local populations.",
