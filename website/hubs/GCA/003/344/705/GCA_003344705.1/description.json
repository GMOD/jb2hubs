  "description": "Aspergillus niger ATCC 13496 is a filamentous fungus species that belongs to the genus Aspergillus. It is a commonly studied and well-characterized strain of A. niger, which is a widely distributed and ubiquitous fungus found in various environments.\n\nA. niger ATCC 13496 is a saprophytic organism, meaning it primarily feeds on decaying organic matter. It is known for its ability to produce a variety of enzymes, including glucoamylases, proteases, and citric acid, which contribute to its industrial and biotechnological applications.\n\nThis strain is a black-spored Aspergillus species, with a distinct dark-colored conidiophore and spore-bearing structures. It is an aerobic fungus, growing well in the presence of oxygen, and can thrive in a range of environmental conditions, including a wide pH and temperature range.\n\nA. niger ATCC 13496 has been extensively studied for its potential in the production of various industrially relevant metabolites and enzymes, making it a valuable model organism in the field of fungal biotechnology and microbiology.",
