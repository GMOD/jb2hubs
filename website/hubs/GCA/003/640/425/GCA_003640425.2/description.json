  "description": "Galleria mellonella, commonly known as the greater wax moth or honeycomb moth, is a species of moth in the family Pyralidae. It is a small, nocturnal moth with a wingspan of approximately 30-40 millimeters.\n\nThe larvae of G. mellonella, commonly referred to as wax worms, are known for their ability to feed on and degrade beeswax, which is the primary component of honeycomb. This unique characteristic has made the wax worm a valuable model organism in various scientific studies, particularly in the fields of entomology, microbiology, and biotechnology.\n\nG. mellonella larvae are characterized by their soft, white bodies and a distinctive brown or black head capsule. The larvae undergo a complete metamorphosis, transforming from the larval stage into a pupa and then into the adult moth form.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is often found in close association with honey bee colonies, where it can cause significant damage to the honeycomb and disrupt the colony's activities.\n\nDue to their unique physiological and behavioral traits, G. mellonella larvae have been extensively used in research, including studies on host-pathogen interactions, toxicology, and the development of novel antimicrobial agents.",
