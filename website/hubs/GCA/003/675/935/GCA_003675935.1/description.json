  "description": "Pogostemon cablin, commonly known as patchouli, is a perennial herb that belongs to the Lamiaceae (mint) family. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, including India, Malaysia, and the Philippines.\n\nPatchouli is an aromatic plant, known for its distinctive earthy and musky fragrance. The plant typically grows to a height of 60-90 cm and has square, hairy stems. The leaves are oblong to lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and densely covered with glandular hairs that produce the essential oil responsible for the characteristic patchouli scent.\n\nThe flowers of Pogostemon cablin are small, pink or white, and arranged in dense, terminal clusters. The plant reproduces both sexually, through the production of seeds, and vegetatively, through the growth of rhizomes and stolons.\n\nPatchouli is widely cultivated for its essential oil, which is extracted from the leaves and used in the perfume, cosmetic, and aromatherapy industries. The essential oil is composed of various terpenes and sesquiterpenes, such as patchoulol, which contribute to its unique aroma and therapeutic properties.",
