  "description": "Malassezia restricta CBS 7877 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. Malassezia is a genus of lipophilic, non-sporulating, and lipid-dependent yeasts that are commonly found on the skin of humans and animals.\n\nMalassezia restricta CBS 7877 is characterized by the following features:\n\n1. Morphology: The cells are round to oval-shaped, and they reproduce by budding.\n\n2. Lipid dependency: Malassezia restricta is a lipid-dependent yeast, meaning it requires lipids or fatty acids for growth and development.\n\n3. Habitat: Malassezia restricta is a common resident of the human skin, particularly in areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the scalp, face, and upper trunk.\n\n4. Clinical relevance: Malassezia restricta has been associated with various skin conditions, including seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and atopic dermatitis, due to its ability to metabolize lipids on the skin surface.\n\n5. Identification: Malassezia restricta can be identified and differentiated from other Malassezia species using various microbiological and molecular techniques, such as biochemical assays, DNA sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).\n\nThis specific strain, Malassezia restricta CBS 7877, was isolated and deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection, which is a recognized international repository for fungal strains.",
