  "description": "Lactococcus lactis is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium. It is a lactic acid-producing bacterium that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum and the Lactococcus genus. Lactococcus lactis is commonly found in dairy products, such as milk and cheese, as well as in various fermented foods.\n\nThis species is known for its ability to efficiently convert lactose, the primary sugar in milk, into lactic acid through the process of homofermentative metabolism. The production of lactic acid contributes to the characteristic flavor and preservation of dairy products. Lactococcus lactis is also used as a starter culture in the production of various fermented dairy products, as it plays a crucial role in the development of texture, aroma, and flavor.\n\nLactococcus lactis has a small genome size, typically around 2.5 to 2.6 million base pairs, and is considered a model organism for the study of lactic acid bacteria. Its genetic tractability and well-characterized physiology have made it a valuable research subject for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the production of industrially relevant metabolites and the interaction with host organisms.",
