  "description": "Manihot esculenta, commonly known as cassava or yuca, is a perennial woody shrub that belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is a major staple food crop, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.\n\nManihot esculenta is native to South America and is widely cultivated for its starchy, tuberous roots, which are a valuable source of carbohydrates. The plant can grow up to 3 meters tall and has palmately lobed leaves. The root system consists of several tuberous roots that can reach up to 1 meter in length and 10 centimeters in diameter.\n\nThe cassava plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited resources. However, the roots and leaves of the plant contain cyanogenic glycosides, which can be toxic if not properly processed. Proper preparation, such as peeling, soaking, and cooking, is necessary to remove these compounds and make the cassava safe for consumption.\n\nCassava is a versatile crop, with its roots used for various food products, such as flour, starch, and tapioca, as well as animal feed. It is an important source of calories and a staple food for millions of people, particularly in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.",
