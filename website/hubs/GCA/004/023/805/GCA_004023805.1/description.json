  "description": "Panthera onca, commonly known as the jaguar, is a large wild cat species native to the Americas. It is the largest cat in the Western Hemisphere and the third-largest in the world, after the tiger and the lion.\n\nJaguars are powerful, stocky cats with a robust build and a broad, rounded head. They have a distinctive coat pattern featuring rosette-like markings that are unique to each individual. Their coat color can range from pale yellow to reddish-brown, with the rosettes typically darker than the background color.\n\nJaguars are apex predators in their ecosystem, preying on a wide variety of animals, including deer, peccaries, capybaras, and even small crocodiles. They are skilled swimmers and climbers, and they often hunt near water sources, using their powerful jaws to deliver a lethal bite to the skull of their prey.\n\nJaguars are solitary and territorial animals, and they are known for their strength and agility. They are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic species and its important role in the ecosystem.",
