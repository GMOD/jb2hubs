  "description": "Moschus moschiferus, commonly known as the Siberian musk deer, is a small hoofed mammal species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Moschidae, which is a distinct family from the true deer (Cervidae).\n\nThe Siberian musk deer is characterized by its compact, muscular build, short legs, and the absence of antlers. Instead, the males possess a pair of elongated canine teeth that protrude from their mouths, which they use for defense and establishing dominance. These canine teeth are the source of the highly valuable musk, a strongly scented secretion produced by a special gland located near the male's navel.\n\nThe Siberian musk deer inhabits dense, mountainous forests and alpine meadows, where it is well-adapted to the rugged terrain. It is a solitary and mainly nocturnal animal, known for its agility and ability to navigate steep, rocky slopes with ease. The species is herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, including grasses, herbs, and the leaves and twigs of shrubs and trees.\n\nDue to the high demand for its musk, which has been used in traditional medicine and perfumes, the Siberian musk deer has faced significant population declines and is considered a threatened species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important component of the Central Asian ecosystems.",
