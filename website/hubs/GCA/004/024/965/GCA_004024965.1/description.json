  "description": "Tragulus javanicus, commonly known as the Java mouse-deer or Javan chevrotain, is a small even-toed ungulate species native to the Indonesian island of Java. It belongs to the family Tragulidae, which includes the smallest known hoofed mammals.\n\nThe Java mouse-deer is a diminutive animal, typically weighing between 1.5 to 4.5 kilograms (3.3 to 9.9 pounds). It has a slender, deer-like build with a small head, large eyes, and delicate limbs. The coat is typically reddish-brown in color with white patches on the underside and legs. These animals are primarily nocturnal and arboreal, inhabiting dense tropical forests and shrublands.\n\nTragulus javanicus is an herbivorous species, feeding on a variety of plant matter, including leaves, fruits, and shoots. They are known for their unique digestive system, which includes a specialized multi-chambered stomach that allows them to efficiently break down plant material.\n\nThe Java mouse-deer is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and hunting pressures. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this diminutive and fascinating member of the Tragulidae family.",
