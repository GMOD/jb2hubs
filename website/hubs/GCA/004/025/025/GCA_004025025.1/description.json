  "description": "Tapirus terrestris, commonly known as the Brazilian tapir or South American tapir, is a large, herbivorous mammal species native to South America. It belongs to the order Perissodactyla, which includes horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs.\n\nThe Brazilian tapir is the largest terrestrial mammal in South America, typically weighing between 150 and 300 kilograms. It has a distinctive elongated snout, which is a flexible, prehensile \"nose-finger\" that it uses for foraging and feeding. The species has a stocky, barrel-shaped body with short, sturdy legs and a small, stubby tail.\n\nThe Brazilian tapir's coat is typically a uniform dark brown or grayish-brown color, with some individuals displaying faint, lighter-colored stripes or spots when young. These patterns help provide camouflage in their dense, forested habitats.\n\nAs a herbivore, the Brazilian tapir feeds on a variety of vegetation, including leaves, fruits, and aquatic plants. It is a solitary and primarily nocturnal animal, spending much of its time wallowing in rivers and streams to regulate its body temperature and escape from biting insects.\n\nThe Brazilian tapir is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting as the primary threats to its survival. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and anti-poaching measures, are crucial for the long-term preservation of this ecologically important species.",
