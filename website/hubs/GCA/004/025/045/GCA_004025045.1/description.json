  "description": "Sigmodon hispidus, commonly known as the hispid cotton rat, is a small rodent species native to North and Central America. It belongs to the genus Sigmodon, which is a group of New World rats.\n\nThe hispid cotton rat is characterized by its robust and stocky build, with a large head and small eyes. Its fur is typically coarse and grayish-brown in color, with a white or buffy underside. The species is named for its hispid (or bristly) appearance, which is due to the stiff, coarse hairs that cover its body.\n\nThese cotton rats are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, seeds, and other plant matter. They are known to be prolific breeders, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year. The species is an important prey item for various predators, including snakes, raptors, and carnivorous mammals.\n\nSigmodon hispidus is widely distributed throughout its range, which extends from the central United States, through Mexico, and into parts of Central America. The species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, as it is abundant and adaptable to a variety of habitats, including grasslands, agricultural areas, and urban environments.",
