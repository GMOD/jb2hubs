  "description": "Ondatra zibethicus, commonly known as the muskrat, is a semiaquatic rodent native to North America. It is a member of the vole family and is the only living species in the genus Ondatra.\n\nThe muskrat is a medium-sized rodent, typically weighing between 0.7 to 2.7 kilograms (1.5 to 6 pounds). It has a stocky build, a large, rounded head, and a laterally flattened tail that aids in swimming. Its dense, waterproof fur is typically dark brown or reddish-brown on the upper parts and grayish-white on the underside.\n\nMuskrats are highly adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, with their partially webbed hind feet and laterally flattened tails. They are found in a variety of freshwater habitats, such as marshes, ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers, where they construct dome-shaped lodges or burrow into the banks.\n\nMuskrats are herbivorous, feeding primarily on aquatic plants, including cattails, bulrushes, and other emergent vegetation. They play an important role in the ecosystem, providing food for predators and shaping the structure of wetland habitats through their foraging and construction activities.\n\nDue to their widespread distribution and adaptability, muskrats are classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, they can be considered a nuisance species in some areas due to their burrowing and feeding activities, which can cause damage to infrastructure and agricultural crops.",
