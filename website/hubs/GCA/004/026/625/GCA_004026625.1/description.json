  "description": "Pipistrellus pipistrellus, commonly known as the common pipistrelle or soprano pipistrelle, is a small species of bat belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. It is one of the smallest bat species in Europe, with a body length of around 3.5-5 cm and a wingspan of 18-25 cm.\n\nThe common pipistrelle has a distinctive reddish-brown fur on its back and lighter-colored belly. Its ears are short and rounded, and its flight is agile and maneuverable, allowing it to catch small insects such as mosquitoes, midges, and small moths.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe, ranging from the United Kingdom and Ireland in the west to Russia in the east, and from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean region in the south. It is a common and adaptable species, often found in urban and suburban areas, as well as in forests and other natural habitats.\n\nThe common pipistrelle is known to use a variety of roosting sites, including crevices in buildings, tree hollows, and bat boxes. It is a social species, often forming small colonies during the breeding season. Females give birth to a single pup, which they care for and nurture until it is able to fly and forage independently.\n\nDue to its widespread distribution and adaptability, the common pipistrelle is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, it faces threats from habitat loss, pesticide use, and wind turbine collisions, among other factors.",
