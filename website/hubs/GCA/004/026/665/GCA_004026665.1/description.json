  "description": "Murina aurata feae is a species of bat that belongs to the family Vespertilionidae, which is the largest family of bats. It is a subspecies of the golden bat (Murina aurata), which is found in several countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nMurina aurata feae is primarily found in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) and parts of Thailand. It is a small bat, with a body length typically ranging from 45 to 55 millimeters (1.8 to 2.2 inches) and a wingspan of around 240 to 270 millimeters (9.4 to 10.6 inches).\n\nThe fur of Murina aurata feae is golden-brown in color, with a distinctive reddish-orange tinge, which is the reason for its common name, the golden bat. The wings and other exposed skin are dark brown or black in color.\n\nLike other bats, Murina aurata feae is a nocturnal species, using echolocation to navigate and hunt for its prey, which primarily consists of insects such as moths, beetles, and flies. It typically roosts in small groups in caves, hollow trees, and other sheltered locations.\n\nThe conservation status of Murina aurata feae is not well-known, as there is limited information available about its population size and distribution. However, the species is believed to be relatively widespread within its known range, and it is not currently considered to be threatened with extinction.",
