  "description": "Nilgiritragus hylocrius, commonly known as the Nilgiri tahr, is a species of wild goat found in the Nilgiri Hills of the Western Ghats in southern India. It is a member of the genus Nilgiritragus, which is part of the family Bovidae.\n\nThe Nilgiri tahr is a medium-sized ungulate, measuring around 1.5 meters in length and standing up to 1 meter tall at the shoulder. It has a stocky build, with short, curved horns and a thick, shaggy coat that ranges in color from dark brown to light gray. The species is adapted to the rugged, mountainous terrain of its habitat, with strong, agile limbs that enable it to navigate steep, rocky slopes with ease.\n\nNilgiri tahrs are social animals, living in herds of up to 20 individuals, led by a dominant female. They are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, and shrubs found in their high-altitude environment. The species is considered to be vulnerable due to habitat loss and hunting, and is the focus of conservation efforts in the region.",
