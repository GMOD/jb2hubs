  "description": "Myocastor coypus, commonly known as the coypu or nutria, is a large, semiaquatic rodent native to South America. The species is characterized by the following scientific features:\n\n1. Taxonomy: Myocastor coypus belongs to the order Rodentia, family Myocastoridae, and is the sole living member of the genus Myocastor.\n\n2. Morphology: Coypus are large rodents, with adult individuals typically weighing between 5 to 9 kg (11 to 20 lbs). They have a stocky, barrel-shaped body, short legs, and a long, rounded tail. Their hind feet are partially webbed, adapted for swimming. The fur is dense and waterproof, ranging in color from reddish-brown to grayish-brown.\n\n3. Habitat and Distribution: Coypus are found in various aquatic habitats, such as marshes, swamps, rivers, and lakes. They are native to South America but have been introduced to many other regions, including North America, Europe, and Asia, where they can become invasive species.\n\n4. Diet and Behavior: Coypus are herbivorous, feeding primarily on aquatic vegetation, such as reeds, cattails, and various grasses. They are semiaquatic, spending a significant portion of their time in the water, where they are skilled swimmers. Coypus are social animals, often living in small family groups or colonies.\n\n5. Reproduction and Life Cycle: Coypus are prolific breeders, with females capable of producing up to three litters per year, each containing 2 to 6 offspring. The gestation period is around 130 days, and the young are born fully developed and able to swim shortly after birth.\n\nOverall, the coypu is an ecologically and economically important species, with both positive and negative impacts in the areas where it has been introduced. Its adaptability and potential for rapid population growth make it a species of interest for both conservation and management efforts.",
