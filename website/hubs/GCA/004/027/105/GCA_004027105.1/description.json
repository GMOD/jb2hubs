  "description": "Nasalis larvatus, commonly known as the proboscis monkey, is a species of Old World monkey found in Borneo, an island shared by Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. This species is characterized by its distinctive large, fleshy nose, which is particularly pronounced in adult males.\n\nThe proboscis monkey is a semi-arboreal primate, spending a significant portion of its time in the trees of the mangrove forests and riverine habitats it inhabits. It is known for its unique social structure, living in multi-male, multi-female groups with a clear hierarchy.\n\nNasalis larvatus is an herbivorous species, primarily feeding on leaves, fruits, and flowers. Its large, protruding nose is believed to play a role in its foraging and social behaviors, potentially enhancing its sense of smell and serving as a visual cue during communication.\n\nThis species is considered endangered due to habitat loss and hunting pressure. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect the remaining populations of the proboscis monkey, which is an iconic and ecologically important component of the Bornean ecosystem.",
