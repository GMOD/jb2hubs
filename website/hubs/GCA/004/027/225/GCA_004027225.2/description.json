  "description": "Strigops habroptila, commonly known as the kakapo, is a critically endangered species of large, flightless, nocturnal parrot endemic to New Zealand. It is the world's heaviest and only flightless parrot.\n\nThe kakapo has a distinctive green-brown plumage that provides excellent camouflage in its forest habitat. It has a large, hooked beak, short legs, and strong claws adapted for climbing trees. The kakapo is a solitary and slow-moving bird, with a unique lek-based mating system where males gather in specific areas and compete for females through loud booming calls.\n\nKakapos are herbivorous, feeding primarily on the leaves, stems, and fruits of various plant species. They have a long lifespan of up to 90 years and are known for their strong bond with their chicks, which they care for over an extended period.\n\nDue to the introduction of predators like rats, stoats, and cats, the kakapo population has declined dramatically, and it is now one of the rarest birds in the world. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding and predator control programs, are underway to protect this unique and fascinating species.",
