  "description": "Galeopterus variegatus, commonly known as the Sunda flying lemur or Malayan flying lemur, is a species of gliding mammal native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cynocephalidae, which includes the only two extant species of flying lemurs.\n\nThe Sunda flying lemur is a medium-sized animal, typically weighing between 1.1 to 2.2 kilograms. It has a distinctive flattened, triangular-shaped head and large, round eyes, which are adaptations for its nocturnal and arboreal lifestyle. The species is covered in a thick, soft fur that ranges in color from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, with a darker dorsal stripe and a lighter ventral surface.\n\nThe most notable feature of the Sunda flying lemur is its expansive gliding membrane, called a patagium, which extends from the wrist to the ankle, allowing it to glide between trees. This adaptation, along with its strong, hooked claws, enables the species to effectively navigate the dense forest canopy of its native range.\n\nGaleopterus variegatus is a solitary, arboreal mammal that is active primarily at night, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including leaves, fruits, and flowers. The species is considered a nocturnal folivore, with a diet that is largely composed of leaves and other plant matter.\n\nThe Sunda flying lemur is found in the tropical forests of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula. It is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss and fragmentation within its range.",
