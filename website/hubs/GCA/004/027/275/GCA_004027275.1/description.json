  "description": "Eulemur fulvus, commonly known as the brown lemur, is a species of lemur native to the island of Madagascar. It is a medium-sized primate belonging to the family Lemuridae.\n\nThe brown lemur has a stocky build with a rounded head, large eyes, and a pointed muzzle. Its fur is generally reddish-brown or grayish-brown in color, with a lighter belly and dark markings around the eyes and muzzle. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males typically being larger and having a darker face than females.\n\nBrown lemurs are arboreal and diurnal, living in the forests of eastern and northern Madagascar. They are social animals, living in small groups of up to 15 individuals, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors, including grooming, play, and vocalizations.\n\nThe diet of the brown lemur consists primarily of fruits, leaves, flowers, and occasional insects. They play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers, contributing to the regeneration of the forest.\n\nEulemur fulvus is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although some populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and agricultural expansion in Madagascar.",
