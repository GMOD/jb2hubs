  "description": "Diceros bicornis, commonly known as the black rhinoceros, is a species of rhinoceros found in Africa. It is one of the five extant species of rhinoceros and is the second-largest terrestrial mammal after the white rhinoceros.\n\nThe black rhinoceros is characterized by its distinctive hooked upper lip, which it uses to grasp and tear leaves and branches. It has two horns, the larger of which can reach up to 1.3 meters in length. The horns are made of keratin, a protein found in the hair and nails of many animals.\n\nThe black rhinoceros is a browser, feeding primarily on a variety of woody plants, shrubs, and trees. It is known for its solitary and territorial behavior, often fiercely defending its habitat from other rhinos and predators.\n\nThe species is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to continued poaching for its horns, which are highly valued in traditional Asian medicine. Conservation efforts, including anti-poaching patrols and habitat protection, are crucial for the survival of this iconic African species.",
