  "description": "Macroglossus sobrinus, also known as the greater long-tongued bat or greater nectar bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Pteropodidae, commonly known as fruit bats or flying foxes. This species is native to Southeast Asia, found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nMacroglossus sobrinus is a small to medium-sized bat, with a body length ranging from 10 to 15 cm and a wingspan of around 35 to 45 cm. These bats have a distinctive long, narrow muzzle and an elongated tongue, which they use to feed on nectar, pollen, and other floral resources. Their diet plays an important role in the pollination of various plant species in their native habitats.\n\nThe fur of Macroglossus sobrinus is typically reddish-brown or greyish-brown in color, and they have large, membranous wings that are used for flight. These bats are known to be highly mobile, often moving between roosting sites and foraging areas throughout their range.\n\nMacroglossus sobrinus is an important component of the ecosystem, contributing to the maintenance of plant diversity and the dispersal of seeds through their pollination and seed-dispersal activities. However, like many other bat species, they face threats from habitat loss, deforestation, and human disturbance, which can impact their populations and ecological roles.",
