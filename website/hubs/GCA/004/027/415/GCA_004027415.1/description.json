  "description": "Hipposideros galeritus, commonly known as the Malayan leaf-nosed bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Hipposideridae. It is found in Southeast Asia, primarily in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand.\n\nThe Malayan leaf-nosed bat is a medium-sized bat, with a head and body length of approximately 50-70 mm and a wingspan of around 300-350 mm. Its fur is typically brown or greyish-brown in color, and it has a distinctive nose leaf, which is a fleshy structure on the nose that aids in echolocation.\n\nThese bats are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of small insects, such as moths, beetles, and flies. They are known to roost in a variety of habitats, including caves, abandoned buildings, and tree hollows.\n\nThe Malayan leaf-nosed bat is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is generally abundant within its range. However, like many bat species, it faces threats from habitat loss and degradation due to human activities.",
