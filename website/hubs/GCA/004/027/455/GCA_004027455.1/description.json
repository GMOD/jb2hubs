  "description": "Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, commonly known as the capybara, is the largest living rodent in the world. It is a semi-aquatic mammal native to South America, found in various habitats such as wetlands, savannas, and even urban areas.\n\nThe capybara is a large, stocky animal with a rounded, barrel-shaped body and short legs. It has a large head, small ears, and a blunt snout. Its dense, coarse fur is typically reddish-brown or grayish in color, and it has partially webbed feet that help it navigate through the water.\n\nCapybaras are highly social animals, often found in groups ranging from a few individuals to over a hundred. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, grasses, and other vegetation. Their large size and adaptations, such as their ability to hold their breath for several minutes, allow them to thrive in their semi-aquatic environment.\n\nCapybaras are known for their docile and friendly nature, and they often interact with other animals, including humans, in their habitat. They play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators, such as jaguars, caimans, and anacondas.\n\nDespite their large size and widespread distribution, capybaras are classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although they face some threats from habitat loss and hunting in certain regions.",
