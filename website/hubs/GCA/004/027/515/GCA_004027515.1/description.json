  "description": "Antilocapra americana, commonly known as the pronghorn, is a North American species of antelope native to the western United States and southern Canada. It is the sole surviving member of the Antilocapridae family and is the fastest land animal in North America, capable of reaching speeds up to 55 miles per hour.\n\nPronghorns are medium-sized ungulates, typically standing about 3 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing between 90 to 150 pounds. They have a distinct white rump patch and a tan to brown coat that helps camouflage them in their natural habitat of open prairies, grasslands, and deserts. The most distinctive feature of the pronghorn is the unique horns, which are composed of a bony core covered in a sheath of keratin that is shed and regrown annually.\n\nPronghorns are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses, forbs, and shrubs. They are adapted to their arid environment, able to go long periods without water and conserve moisture through specialized metabolic processes. Pronghorns are social animals, living in small herds and engaging in behaviors such as alarm calls and territorial displays to communicate and maintain group cohesion.\n\nConservation efforts have helped stabilize pronghorn populations after they were nearly driven to extinction in the late 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss. Today, the pronghorn is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, but continued management and protection of their remaining habitat remains crucial for the long-term survival of this unique North American species.",
