  "description": "Plecturocebus donacophilus, commonly known as the white-eared titi monkey, is a species of small New World monkey found in central and eastern Bolivia, southeastern Peru, and northwestern Brazil. It belongs to the genus Plecturocebus, which is part of the titi monkey family (Callicebus).\n\nThe white-eared titi monkey is characterized by its distinctive white ear tufts and grayish-brown fur. It is a diurnal and arboreal species, typically living in monogamous family groups and occupying home ranges in tropical and subtropical forests. These titi monkeys are primarily frugivorous, supplementing their diet with leaves, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nPlecturocebus donacophilus is known for its strong pair-bonding behavior, with mated pairs often engaging in vocal duets and maintaining close proximity throughout the day. The species plays an important role in the forest ecosystem as a seed disperser and helps maintain the ecological balance of the habitats it occupies.\n\nConservation-wise, the white-eared titi monkey is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, although its populations are affected by habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities in its range.",
