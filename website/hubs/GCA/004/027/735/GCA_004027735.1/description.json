  "description": "Carollia perspicillata, commonly known as the Jamaican yellow bat or Jamaican fruit-eating bat, is a species of bat that belongs to the family Phyllostomidae. This small-sized bat is widely distributed throughout Central and South America, ranging from Mexico to Brazil.\n\nThe Carollia perspicillata is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of approximately 6-8 cm and a wingspan of 25-30 cm. It has a distinct pointed snout, large ears, and a well-developed nose leaf, which is a fleshy structure on the nose that helps in echolocation. The fur of the Carollia perspicillata is typically brownish-gray or reddish-brown in color, and its wings are dark in color.\n\nThese bats are known to be primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, including bananas, figs, and other tropical fruits. They play an important role in the ecosystem by serving as pollinators and seed dispersers for the plants they feed on. Carollia perspicillata is also known to occasionally consume nectar, pollen, and insects.\n\nThe Carollia perspicillata is a social species and typically roosts in large colonies, often in caves, abandoned buildings, or hollow trees. They are capable of using echolocation to navigate and locate their prey and roosting sites. The species is considered to be of \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its wide distribution and relatively stable population numbers.",
