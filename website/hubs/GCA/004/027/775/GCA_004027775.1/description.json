  "description": "Bradypus variegatus, commonly known as the brown-throated sloth, is a species of three-toed sloth found in Central and South America. It is a medium-sized sloth, typically measuring around 60-70 cm in length and weighing between 3.5-8 kg.\n\nThe brown-throated sloth is characterized by a dense, coarse fur that ranges in color from grayish-brown to reddish-brown, with a distinctive yellowish-brown or beige throat and chest. Its face is rounded, with a small, button-like nose and small, dark eyes. The sloth's limbs are adapted for a primarily arboreal lifestyle, with curved claws that allow it to move slowly and efficiently through the trees.\n\nThis species is primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of leaves, twigs, and fruits found in the tropical and subtropical forests of its range. Sloths are known for their slow metabolic rate and sedentary lifestyle, often spending the majority of their time sleeping or resting in the canopy.\n\nThe brown-throated sloth is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its wide distribution and relatively stable population. However, it faces threats from habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities.",
