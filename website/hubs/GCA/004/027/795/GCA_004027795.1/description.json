  "description": "Ceratotherium simum cottoni, commonly known as the Northern White Rhinoceros, is a critically endangered subspecies of the white rhinoceros. It is one of the rarest mammals on Earth, with only two known individuals remaining in the world as of 2022.\n\nThe Northern White Rhinoceros is a large, herbivorous mammal that is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its snout. These horns are made of keratin, a protein found in hair and nails, and are used for defense, territorial marking, and social interactions.\n\nCompared to the more common Southern White Rhinoceros, the Northern White Rhinoceros is slightly smaller and has a more pronounced hump on its back. It also has a more rounded head and a slightly different horn shape.\n\nThe primary threats to the Northern White Rhinoceros include poaching for its valuable horns, habitat loss, and political instability in its native range in Central Africa. Conservation efforts to protect this subspecies have been ongoing, but the small population size and limited genetic diversity pose significant challenges to its long-term survival.",
