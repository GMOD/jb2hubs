  "description": "Alouatta palliata, also known as the Mantled Howler Monkey, is a species of howler monkey native to Central America. These primates are known for their distinctive loud vocalizations, which can be heard up to 5 kilometers away and are used for communication and territorial defense.\n\nAlouatta palliata are arboreal and folivorous, meaning they primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and flowers. They have a specialized digestive system with a large, complex stomach that allows them to efficiently process the fibrous plant material they consume.\n\nThese monkeys have a robust and muscular build, with a prehensile tail that they use for balance and support while moving through the trees. They typically live in social groups ranging from 5 to 20 individuals, with a dominant male leading the group.\n\nAlouatta palliata is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these primates and their forest habitats in Central America.",
