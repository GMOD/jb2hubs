  "description": "Orientallactaga bullata, also known as the Bactrian jerboa, is a species of small rodent belonging to the family Dipodidae. It is native to Central Asia, primarily found in regions of China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Bactrian jerboa is a nocturnal and semi-fossorial (living partly underground) animal, characterized by its distinctive long hind legs and a long, tufted tail. The species typically ranges in length from 12 to 16 centimeters, with a tail length of 15 to 20 centimeters.\n\nOrientallactaga bullata is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its habitat, with a compact body and large ears that help regulate its body temperature. It is an herbivorous species, feeding primarily on various grasses, herbs, and seeds.\n\nThe species is known for its impressive jumping abilities, using its powerful hind legs to hop and evade predators. Bactrian jerboas are social animals, often living in burrow systems with multiple individuals.\n\nDue to habitat loss and degradation, Orientallactaga bullata is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although its population trends and conservation status may vary across its range.",
