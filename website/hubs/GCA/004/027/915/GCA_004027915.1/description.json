  "description": "Capromys pilorides, also known as the Cuban hutia, is a large, arboreal rodent species native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Capromyidae, which is a group of rodents endemic to the Caribbean islands.\n\nThe Cuban hutia is a heavy-bodied animal with a large head, rounded ears, and a long, prehensile tail that it uses for climbing and balancing. Its fur is coarse and varies in color from brown to grayish-black, often with a reddish-brown tinge. Adults can reach a length of up to 60 cm (24 inches) and weigh up to 8 kg (17.6 lbs), making it one of the largest rodents in the Caribbean region.\n\nThese hutias are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, including leaves, fruits, and bark. They are known to be skilled climbers and often inhabit forests, scrublands, and rocky areas. They are primarily nocturnal and arboreal, with their prehensile tails allowing them to move easily through the trees.\n\nThe Cuban hutia is an important part of the local ecosystem, playing a role in seed dispersal and forest regeneration. However, they have faced threats from habitat loss, hunting, and the introduction of non-native predators, leading to their classification as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
