  "description": "Chaetophractus vellerosus, commonly known as the screaming hairy armadillo, is a species of armadillo native to South America. It belongs to the family Chlamyphoridae and the genus Chaetophractus.\n\nThe screaming hairy armadillo is a small to medium-sized armadillo, typically measuring between 30 to 40 centimeters in length and weighing around 2 to 4 kilograms. Its most distinctive feature is the dense, shaggy fur covering its body, which gives it a hairy appearance. The carapace, or shell, is composed of bony plates arranged in movable bands, allowing the animal to curl up into a ball for protection.\n\nThis species is found in the central and southern regions of Argentina, as well as parts of Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. It inhabits a variety of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and arid regions, where it constructs burrows for shelter and nesting.\n\nChaetophractus vellerosus is a nocturnal and solitary species, feeding primarily on insects, small vertebrates, and plant matter. It is known for its unique defensive behavior, which includes emitting high-pitched screams or hisses when threatened, earning it the common name \"screaming hairy armadillo.\"\n\nThe conservation status of the screaming hairy armadillo is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats.",
