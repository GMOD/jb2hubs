  "description": "Ordospora colligata is a microsporidian parasite that infects aquatic crustaceans, particularly freshwater amphipods. Microsporidia are a group of obligate intracellular fungal-like parasites that are known for their small genomes and unique cellular structures.\n\nOrdospora colligata is characterized by its spore morphology, which is ovoid or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring approximately 4-6 μm in length and 2-3 μm in width. The spores contain a distinctive polaroplast, a coiled polar tube, and a single nucleus, which are typical features of microsporidian spores.\n\nThe life cycle of Ordospora colligata involves the release of the infective spores, which then enter the host cells, where they undergo merogony (proliferative stage) and sporogony (spore formation). The parasite can spread horizontally between hosts, often through the ingestion of spores or contaminated water.\n\nOrdospora colligata has been reported to infect various species of freshwater amphipods, such as those belonging to the genus Gammarus, and can have significant impacts on the host's survival, reproduction, and behavior. Understanding the biology and ecology of this parasite is important for studying the interactions between microsporidia and their crustacean hosts in aquatic ecosystems.",
