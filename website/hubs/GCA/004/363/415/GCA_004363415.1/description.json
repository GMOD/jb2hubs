  "description": "Eschrichtius robustus, commonly known as the gray whale, is a large marine mammal species that belongs to the order Cetacea. It is the only living species within the family Eschrichtiidae and is considered one of the most ancient baleen whale species.\n\nGray whales are characterized by their distinctive gray coloration, which is mottled with white patches, and their lack of a dorsal fin. They have a robust, elongated body with a small, triangular-shaped head and a narrow, tapered snout. Gray whales are filter feeders and use their baleen plates to sieve small crustaceans, such as amphipods and mysids, from the seafloor.\n\nThese whales are known for their remarkable annual migrations, traveling from their feeding grounds in the Arctic regions to their breeding and calving areas in the lagoons of Baja California, Mexico. The gray whale population is divided into two distinct subpopulations: the eastern North Pacific population and the critically endangered western North Pacific population.\n\nConservation efforts have been crucial for the recovery of the eastern North Pacific gray whale population, which was once heavily hunted. Today, the species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although the western North Pacific population remains vulnerable to various threats, including entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with ships.",
