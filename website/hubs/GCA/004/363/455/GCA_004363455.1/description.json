  "description": "Eubalaena japonica, also known as the North Pacific right whale, is a species of baleen whale that belongs to the genus Eubalaena. This whale is one of the rarest and most endangered large whale species in the world.\n\nEubalaena japonica is a member of the family Balaenidae, which includes the three right whale species. It is a large, stocky whale with a large, rounded head and no dorsal fin. The species is primarily black in color, with distinctive white callosities (rough, raised patches of skin) on its head and rostrum.\n\nNorth Pacific right whales typically reach lengths of around 15 to 18 meters (49 to 59 feet) and can weigh up to 100 metric tons. They are filter feeders, using their baleen plates to strain small crustaceans and other zooplankton from the water.\n\nOnce abundant in the North Pacific, the population of Eubalaena japonica was severely depleted by commercial whaling in the 19th and 20th centuries. Today, it is one of the most endangered whale species, with a current population estimated to be fewer than 1,000 individuals. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and monitor this critically endangered species.",
