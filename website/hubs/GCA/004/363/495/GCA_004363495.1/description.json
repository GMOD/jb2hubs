  "description": "Phocoena phocoena, commonly known as the harbor porpoise, is a small species of porpoise found in temperate and subarctic coastal waters of the Northern Hemisphere. It is one of the smallest species of cetaceans, typically measuring between 1.4 to 1.9 meters in length and weighing around 45 to 70 kilograms.\n\nHarbor porpoises have a stocky, rounded body shape with a short, blunt beak and a small, triangular dorsal fin. Their coloration is typically dark gray on the back, with a lighter gray or white belly. These animals are known for their rapid, erratic swimming patterns and their tendency to remain close to shore, often entering bays, estuaries, and even rivers.\n\nPhocoena phocoena is an opportunistic predator, feeding primarily on small fish, such as herring, cod, and whiting, as well as crustaceans and squid. They use their acute sense of hearing and echolocation abilities to locate and capture their prey.\n\nThese porpoises are social animals, typically found in small groups or pairs, and they are known to be relatively shy and elusive around human activity. They are considered a vulnerable species due to various threats, including bycatch in fishing operations, pollution, and habitat degradation.\n\nConservation efforts for the harbor porpoise focus on reducing bycatch, protecting their coastal habitats, and monitoring their population trends to ensure the long-term survival of this species.",
