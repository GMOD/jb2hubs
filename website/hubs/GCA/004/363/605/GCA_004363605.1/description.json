  "description": "The Indri (Indri indri) is a critically endangered species of lemur found only in the rainforests of eastern Madagascar. It is the largest living lemur, with an average body weight of around 6-10 kilograms.\n\nThe Indri has a distinctive black and white coat, with a rounded head, large eyes, and a short, stubby tail. It is an arboreal species, spending most of its time in the upper canopy of the forest, moving through the trees using a combination of leaping and climbing.\n\nIndri are known for their unique vocalizations, which can be heard up to 3 kilometers away. Their haunting, wailing calls are used for communication and to mark their territory. They live in small family groups, typically consisting of a mated pair and their offspring.\n\nIndri are herbivores, feeding primarily on leaves, fruit, and flowers. They play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers, contributing to the regeneration of the forest.\n\nThe Indri is classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this iconic Malagasy species and its rainforest habitat.",
