  "description": "Cuniculus paca, commonly known as the paca or spotted paca, is a large rodent species native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Cuniculidae, which includes only one other living species, the mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii).\n\nThe paca is a stocky, terrestrial rodent with a rounded body and short, robust limbs. Its distinctive features include a broad, flattened head, large eyes, and rounded ears. The paca's coat is typically grayish-brown in color, with distinct white or yellowish spots or bands along its sides. This unique pattern serves as a form of camouflage in the dense forest habitats it inhabits.\n\nPacas are primarily nocturnal and herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including fruits, seeds, leaves, and roots. They are excellent swimmers and climbers, and they often take refuge in burrows or hollow logs during the day. Pacas play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as prey for predators and contributing to seed dispersal through their foraging activities.\n\nCuniculus paca is widely distributed throughout Central and South America, ranging from Mexico to northern Argentina. They are considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, hunting, and other human-related threats. Conservation efforts, including the creation of protected areas and the regulation of hunting, are essential for the long-term survival of this unique and ecologically important rodent species.",
