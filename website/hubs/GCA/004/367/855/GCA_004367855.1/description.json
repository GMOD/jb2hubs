  "description": "Oikopleura vanhoeffeni is a species of free-swimming marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Urochordata, and class Appendicularia. It is a small, barrel-shaped, gelatinous creature known as an appendicularian or larvacean.\n\nOikopleura vanhoeffeni is found in the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. It is a planktonic organism, meaning it drifts freely in the water column. The animal's body is composed of a head-like structure called a trunk, a tail-like structure called a tail, and a gelatinous house or \"tunic\" that it secretes and uses for feeding.\n\nThe trunk of O. vanhoeffeni contains a simple nervous system, a digestive system, and a notochord, which is a flexible rod-like structure that provides support and aids in locomotion. The animal propels itself through the water by undulating its tail. It feeds by creating a complex mucus net within its gelatinous house, which it uses to filter small particles and plankton from the surrounding water.\n\nOikopleura vanhoeffeni plays a role in marine food webs as a consumer of microplankton and as prey for larger planktivorous organisms. Its small size and abundance make it an important component of pelagic ecosystems.",
