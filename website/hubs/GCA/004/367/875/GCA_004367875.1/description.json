  "description": "Oikopleura albicans is a species of pelagic tunicate, commonly known as a larvacean or appendicularian. Tunicates are a type of marine invertebrate that belong to the phylum Chordata, which includes vertebrates.\n\nOikopleura albicans is a small, free-swimming organism, typically measuring a few millimeters in length. It has a transparent, gelatinous body with a distinct head and a long, tail-like appendage called a \"tail\" or \"trunk.\" The tail is used for propulsion, allowing the organism to swim through the water.\n\nOikopleura albicans is a filter feeder, using a complex feeding structure called a \"house\" to capture small suspended particles, such as phytoplankton and detritus, from the surrounding water. The house is a transparent, mucus-like structure that the organism secretes and can be rapidly replaced when it becomes clogged.\n\nThis species is widely distributed in the world's oceans, particularly in temperate and tropical regions. Oikopleura albicans plays an important role in marine food webs, serving as a food source for larger predators, such as fish and invertebrates.",
