  "description": "Oikopleura longicauda is a species of marine invertebrate animal belonging to the phylum Chordata, class Appendicularia, also known as the larvaceans or free-swimming tunicates. It is a small, free-swimming, planktonic organism that inhabits the upper layers of the world's oceans.\n\nOikopleura longicauda has a distinctive body plan, with a small, barrel-shaped trunk and a long, whip-like tail. The trunk contains the animal's internal organs, including a complex feeding structure called a \"house,\" which it uses to filter food particles from the surrounding water. The long, flexible tail is used for propulsion, allowing the animal to swim quickly and efficiently.\n\nThese organisms are important components of marine ecosystems, playing a role in the cycling of nutrients and energy through the food web. They are known to be prolific breeders, with females capable of producing thousands of eggs at a time. Oikopleura longicauda and other larvacean species are also widely used as model organisms in scientific research, contributing to our understanding of chordate biology and evolution.",
