  "description": "Fritillaria borealis, commonly known as the northern fritillary, is a species of flowering plant that belongs to the genus Fritillaria, which is part of the lily family (Liliaceae). This perennial herbaceous plant is native to the northern regions of North America, including Alaska, Canada, and the northwestern United States.\n\nThe northern fritillary is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that are typically nodding and pendulous. The flowers can range in color from purplish-brown to greenish-yellow, often with a checkered or mottled pattern. The plant produces a single, slender stem that can grow up to 60 cm (24 inches) tall, and the leaves are linear and arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem.\n\nFritillaria borealis prefers cool, moist habitats, such as alpine and subalpine meadows, rocky slopes, and coniferous forests. It is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range, which can include long, cold winters and short growing seasons.\n\nThe northern fritillary is considered to be a member of the Fritillaria genus, which is known for its distinctive and often beautiful flowers. The genus is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, with many species found in North America, Europe, and Asia.",
