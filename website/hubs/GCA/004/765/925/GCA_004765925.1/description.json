  "description": "Euprymna scolopes, commonly known as the Hawaiian bobtail squid, is a small species of bobtail squid found in the shallow coastal waters of the Hawaiian archipelago. It is a member of the Sepiolidae family, which are characterized by their rounded, comma-shaped bodies and the absence of fins.\n\nThe Hawaiian bobtail squid is typically 2-4 inches (5-10 cm) in length and has a distinctive light-emitting organ called a \"light organ\" or \"photophore\" located on the underside of its mantle. This organ contains bioluminescent bacteria, Vibrio fischeri, which the squid cultivates and uses to camouflage itself from predators by counter-illuminating its silhouette, making it appear less visible to prey or predators swimming below.\n\nEuprymna scolopes is a nocturnal, benthic species that burrows into the sandy seafloor during the day and emerges at night to hunt small crustaceans and fish. It has a relatively short lifespan, typically living for only 6-9 months. The Hawaiian bobtail squid is an important model organism in the study of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and marine invertebrates, as well as in the research of bioluminescence and camouflage strategies in cephalopods.",
