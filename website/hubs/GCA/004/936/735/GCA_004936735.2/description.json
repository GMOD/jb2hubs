  "description": "Cryptosporidium sp. chipmunk genotype I is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Cryptosporidium. It is a species of Cryptosporidium that has been identified in chipmunks, a small ground-dwelling rodent found in North America.\n\nCryptosporidium is a genus of parasitic protozoa that can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, and cause the disease cryptosporidiosis. The chipmunk genotype I of Cryptosporidium is a specific genotype or genetic variant of the parasite that has been isolated from and associated with infections in chipmunks.\n\nThis genotype is characterized by its genetic and molecular characteristics, which differentiate it from other Cryptosporidium species and genotypes found in other host species. The identification and study of this chipmunk-specific genotype contribute to the understanding of the diversity and host-specificity of Cryptosporidium parasites, which is important for epidemiological and public health considerations related to cryptosporidiosis.",
