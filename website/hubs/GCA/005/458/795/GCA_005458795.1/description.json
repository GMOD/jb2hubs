  "description": "Marmota vancouverensis, commonly known as the Vancouver Island Marmot, is a species of marmot native to the subalpine meadows and rocky areas of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. It is a medium-sized burrowing mammal belonging to the ground squirrel family, Sciuridae.\n\nThe Vancouver Island Marmot is characterized by its distinctive dark brown to black fur with white patches on the face, chest, and belly. It has a robust, stocky build and a large, rounded head. Adults typically weigh between 4 to 6 kilograms (8.8 to 13.2 pounds).\n\nThis species is an obligate hibernator, spending up to 7 months of the year in a state of torpor, emerging from its burrow in late spring to early summer. During the active season, it is primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, sedges, and various alpine plants.\n\nThe Vancouver Island Marmot is considered one of the rarest and most endangered mammals in the world, with a critically low population due to habitat loss, predation, and other environmental factors. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding and reintroduction programs, are ongoing to protect this unique and charismatic species.",
