  "description": "Bos grunniens, commonly known as the yak, is a large, long-haired bovine species that is native to the Himalayan mountain range in Central Asia. The yak is a domesticated subspecies of the wild yak (Bos mutus), which is found in the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau.\n\nPhysically, the yak is characterized by its thick, shaggy coat that helps it adapt to the cold, harsh environments of its native habitat. The species has a distinctive hump on its shoulders, and its horns can grow up to 1 meter in length. Yaks are well-adapted to the high altitudes, with their cardiovascular and respiratory systems capable of efficiently utilizing the low-oxygen environments.\n\nYaks are essential to the livelihoods of many Himalayan communities, providing milk, meat, hair, and dung as fuel and fertilizer. They are also used as pack animals, transporting goods and people across the rugged mountain terrain. Genetically, the yak is closely related to other bovine species, such as domestic cattle, and can interbreed with them, producing fertile offspring known as \"dzo\" or \"yattle.\"\n\nOverall, the yak is a remarkable example of the adaptations that allow certain species to thrive in some of the harshest environments on Earth, and it plays a vital role in the cultural and economic fabric of the Himalayan region.",
