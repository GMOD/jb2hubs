  "description": "Balaenoptera musculus, commonly known as the blue whale, is the largest known extant species of animal on Earth. It belongs to the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Blue whales are found in all major oceans around the world, with distinct populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBlue whales are characterized by their distinctive blue-gray coloration, which can appear mottled or patchy. They have a long, streamlined body shape and a relatively small, tapered head. These massive animals can grow up to 30 meters (98 feet) in length and weigh up to 180 metric tons (200 short tons), making them the heaviest known extant vertebrates.\n\nBlue whales are filter feeders, primarily consuming krill, which are small, shrimp-like crustaceans. They use their massive baleen plates, which hang from their upper jaws, to filter large volumes of water and capture their prey. Blue whales are known for their powerful, low-frequency calls, which can be heard over hundreds of kilometers and are believed to be used for communication and social interactions.\n\nDue to historical commercial whaling, blue whale populations were severely depleted in the 20th century. However, conservation efforts have led to a gradual recovery of some populations, although the species remains classified as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
