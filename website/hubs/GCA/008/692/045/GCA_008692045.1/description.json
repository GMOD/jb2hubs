  "description": "Phocoena sinus, commonly known as the Vaquita, is a small porpoise species endemic to the upper Gulf of California, Mexico. It is one of the rarest and most endangered marine mammals in the world.\n\nThe Vaquita is a small cetacean, with an average body length of around 1.5 meters and a weight of approximately 50 kilograms. It has a rounded, blunt head, a small, triangular dorsal fin, and a distinctive dark grey or black ring around its eyes and lips. The Vaquita's body is typically a greyish-white color, with a slightly darker grey or brown back.\n\nThis species is adapted to the shallow, turbid waters of the upper Gulf of California, where it feeds primarily on small fish and squid. The Vaquita is a shy and elusive animal, and little is known about its social structure and behavior.\n\nThe Vaquita is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to the severe decline in its population, which is primarily driven by bycatch in fishing nets. Conservation efforts to protect the Vaquita and its habitat are ongoing, but the species remains on the brink of extinction.",
