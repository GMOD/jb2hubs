  "description": "Poliovirus 3 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Poliovirus 3 is one of the three serotypes of the poliovirus, which is the causative agent of the disease poliomyelitis, a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal viral infection that primarily affects the motor neurons in the central nervous system.\n\nThe poliovirus genome is approximately 7,500 nucleotides in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins. The virus primarily infects and replicates within the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the oropharynx and the intestines, and can subsequently spread to the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic symptoms of polio, such as limb paralysis.\n\nPoliovirus 3 is considered the least common of the three poliovirus serotypes, but it can still cause severe disease in unvaccinated individuals. The development and widespread use of effective polio vaccines have led to a significant reduction in the global incidence of poliomyelitis, and the World Health Organization is currently working towards the eradication of the disease worldwide.",
