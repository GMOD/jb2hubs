  "description": "Human poliovirus 1 strain Sabin is a strain of the poliovirus serotype 1, which is one of the three main serotypes of the poliovirus that can cause the infectious disease poliomyelitis (polio) in humans. The Sabin strain was developed by the American physician and microbiologist Dr. Albert Sabin in the 1950s.\n\nThe Sabin strain is an attenuated (weakened) form of the wild-type poliovirus 1, which means it has been genetically modified to reduce its virulence and pathogenicity, while still retaining its ability to elicit an immune response. This attenuated strain was designed for use in the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was instrumental in the global effort to eradicate polio.\n\nUnlike the wild-type virus, the Sabin strain has a reduced ability to replicate and cause the severe neurological symptoms associated with polio, making it a safer option for vaccination. The Sabin strain is classified as a live, attenuated virus vaccine, and its use has played a crucial role in the significant reduction of polio cases worldwide.",
