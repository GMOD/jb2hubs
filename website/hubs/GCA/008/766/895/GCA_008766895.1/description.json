  "description": "Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.\n\nEV-A71 is a significant human pathogen, primarily affecting infants and young children. It is a leading cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a common childhood illness characterized by the development of skin rashes and blisters on the hands, feet, and mouth. In some cases, EV-A71 infections can also lead to more severe neurological complications, such as aseptic meningitis, brainstem encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis.\n\nThe virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, fecal matter, or contaminated surfaces. It can also spread through the fecal-oral route. EV-A71 exhibits a wide genetic diversity, with multiple genotypes and subgenotypes identified globally, which can contribute to its ability to cause outbreaks and epidemics.\n\nEffective prevention and control of EV-A71 infections rely on improved hygiene practices, timely diagnosis, and the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. Ongoing research and surveillance efforts are crucial for understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential strategies to combat this significant public health concern.",
