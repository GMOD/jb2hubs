  "description": "Hepatovirus A, also known as the Hepatitis A virus (HAV), is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Hepatovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis, a liver infection characterized by inflammation and necrosis of hepatocytes.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either by consuming contaminated food or water or through direct contact with an infected individual. Once ingested, the virus enters the gastrointestinal tract and subsequently infects the liver, where it replicates and is shed in the feces.\n\nHepatovirus A has a genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases in length, which encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly. The virus is relatively stable and can survive in the environment for extended periods, contributing to its efficient transmission.\n\nInfection with Hepatovirus A typically results in an acute, self-limiting illness characterized by fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and jaundice. While most infections are asymptomatic or mild, severe cases can lead to fulminant hepatic failure, a life-threatening condition. Effective vaccines are available to prevent Hepatovirus A infection, and proper hygiene and sanitation measures are crucial in controlling the spread of the virus.",
