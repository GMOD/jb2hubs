It is a deciduous, climbing plant that can grow up to 9 meters (30 feet) in length.\n\nThe leaves of Actinidia chinensis are broadly ovate, with a cordate (heart-shaped) base and a pointed tip. They are typically 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) long and 8-12 cm (3-5 inches) wide, with a distinctive hairy or velvety texture.\n\nThe flowers of the kiwifruit plant are white or greenish-white, with five to six petals and numerous stamens. They are typically 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 inches) in diameter and are produced in clusters.\n\nThe most notable feature of Actinidia chinensis is its edible fruit, which is oval-shaped and can grow up to 7 cm (2.8 inches) in length. The fruit has a fuzzy, brown exterior and a bright green interior with small, black seeds arranged in a radial pattern. The flesh is soft, juicy, and has a distinctive, slightly tart flavor.\n\nActinidia chinensis is widely cultivated for its nutritious and tasty fruit, which is rich in vitamins C, E, and K, as well as minerals such as potassium and magnesium. The plant is also valued for its ornamental properties and is often used as a decorative climbing vine in gardens and landscaping.",
