  "description": "Callithrix jacchus, commonly known as the common marmoset, is a small New World primate species native to the Atlantic coastal forests of northeastern Brazil. As a member of the family Callitrichidae, it is one of the smallest primates in the world, weighing between 300-400 grams on average.\n\nPhysically, Callithrix jacchus has a distinctive appearance with a small, slender body, a rounded head, and large eyes. Its fur is typically gray, with a white face and tufted ears. They have sharp claws, known as tegulae, which they use for locomotion and foraging.\n\nBehaviorally, common marmosets are highly social, living in small family groups of around 3-15 individuals. They are arboreal, spending most of their time in the upper canopy of the forest, and are known for their agile and acrobatic movements. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nCallithrix jacchus is an important model organism in biomedical research, particularly in the fields of neuroscience and reproductive biology. Additionally, they play a crucial role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers and insect regulators, contributing to the overall health of the Atlantic coastal forests.",
