  "description": "Naja naja, commonly known as the Indian cobra or spectacled cobra, is a venomous snake species found in the Indian subcontinent. It is a member of the genus Naja, which includes various species of cobras.\n\nThe Indian cobra is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 meters in length. It has a distinctive hood that it can flare out when threatened, revealing a pattern of overlapping circles on the underside, which resembles a pair of spectacles, hence the name \"spectacled cobra.\"\n\nThe snake's coloration can vary, ranging from light tan to dark brown, with some individuals displaying a reddish or yellowish hue. The body is covered in smooth, overlapping scales, and the head is relatively small in proportion to the body.\n\nNaja naja is a neurotoxic snake, meaning its venom primarily affects the nervous system. The venom can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and, if left untreated, can lead to death. The species is considered one of the \"Big Four\" most dangerous snakes in India, along with the common krait, Russell's viper, and saw-scaled viper.\n\nThe Indian cobra is widely distributed across the Indian subcontinent, including parts of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It is found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and human-modified environments, such as agricultural areas and urban settings.\n\nThis species plays an important ecological role as a predator, feeding on small mammals, birds, lizards, and other snakes. It is also culturally significant in many parts of the region, often being associated with Hindu deities and featured in various cultural practices and art forms.",
