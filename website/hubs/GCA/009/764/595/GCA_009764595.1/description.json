  "description": "Geothlypis trichas, commonly known as the Common Yellowthroat, is a small songbird species belonging to the warbler family Parulidae. It is native to North America, ranging from Canada to Mexico and parts of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Common Yellowthroat is a distinctive bird, with a bright yellow throat and belly, a black mask across the eyes, and olive-green upperparts. Males and females have slightly different plumage, with the males having a more prominent black mask.\n\nGeothlypis trichas is known for its unique breeding behavior, where the males perform a distinctive \"witchety-witchety-witchety\" song to attract mates and defend their territories. The species is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects and spiders found in their preferred habitats, which include wetlands, marshes, and dense shrubby areas.\n\nThe Common Yellowthroat is a migratory species, with populations in the northern parts of its range moving south for the winter. The species is generally considered to be of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although local population declines have been observed in some regions due to habitat loss and degradation.",
