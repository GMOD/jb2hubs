  "description": "Cygnus olor, commonly known as the Mute Swan, is a large species of swan native to Eurasia. It is a member of the genus Cygnus, which includes several species of swans.\n\nThe Mute Swan is a large, graceful bird with a distinctive long, curved neck and a bright orange beak with a black knob at the base. It has pure white plumage and black legs and feet. The species is known for its characteristic \"mute\" behavior, as it is less vocal compared to other swan species.\n\nMute Swans are found in a variety of wetland habitats, including lakes, ponds, rivers, and coastal areas. They are mainly herbivorous, feeding on aquatic plants, grasses, and algae. They are known for their territorial behavior, especially during the breeding season, when they aggressively defend their nesting sites.\n\nThe Mute Swan is an important part of many cultural and artistic traditions in Europe, and it is often associated with grace, beauty, and elegance. However, in some regions, it has been introduced as an invasive species and can have negative impacts on native ecosystems.",
