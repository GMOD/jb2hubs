The species is predominantly black in color, with white primary feathers and a bright blue facial skin. Adult birds can grow up to 120 cm in length and weigh up to 5 kg, making them one of the largest hornbill species.\n\nThese birds are adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, spending most of their time foraging on the ground for a diverse diet that includes insects, small vertebrates, and plant matter. They are known for their strong social behavior, often living in family groups and engaging in complex vocal and visual communication.\n\nThe Abyssinian ground hornbill is classified as a Near Threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, hunting, and other threats.
