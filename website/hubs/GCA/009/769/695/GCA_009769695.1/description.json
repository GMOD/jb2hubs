  "description": "Thamnophis elegans, commonly known as the Western Terrestrial Garter Snake, is a species of nonvenomous snake found in western North America. It belongs to the genus Thamnophis, which includes various species of garter snakes.\n\nThe Western Terrestrial Garter Snake is characterized by its slender, elongated body and a distinct pattern of stripes or bands along its length. The snake's dorsal coloration can range from olive-green to brownish, with three longitudinal stripes - one along the center of the back and one along each side. The ventral side is typically yellowish or cream-colored.\n\nThese snakes are typically found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, forests, and wetlands. They are known to be excellent swimmers and are often observed near water sources, such as streams, ponds, and marshes, where they primarily feed on small rodents, amphibians, and invertebrates.\n\nThamnophis elegans is an ectothermic, or cold-blooded, species, relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are active during the day and engage in a range of behaviors, including basking, hunting, and seeking shelter.\n\nThe Western Terrestrial Garter Snake plays an important ecological role as a predator and as a prey species for larger animals, such as birds of prey and larger snakes. This species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, although local populations may face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation.",
