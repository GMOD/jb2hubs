  "description": "Oryctolagus cuniculus, commonly known as the European rabbit or common rabbit, is a species of rabbit native to southwestern Europe (including the Iberian Peninsula) and northwest Africa. It is a small mammal that belongs to the family Leporidae.\n\nThe European rabbit is typically gray-brown in color, with a short, fluffy tail and large, upright ears. They have powerful hind legs and are excellent burrowers, constructing complex underground tunnel systems called warrens. Rabbits are herbivorous, feeding primarily on grasses, herbs, and other vegetation.\n\nOryctolagus cuniculus is a social animal, living in small groups within their warrens. They are known for their prolific breeding, with females (does) capable of producing multiple litters per year. Rabbits play an important role in their ecosystems, serving as a food source for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity.\n\nDue to its widespread introduction and successful adaptation to new environments, the European rabbit is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world, where it can have significant ecological and economic impacts. However, it remains an important domestic species, valued for its meat, fur, and as a popular pet.",
