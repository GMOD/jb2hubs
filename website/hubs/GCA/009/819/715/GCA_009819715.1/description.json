It is also known to consume berries and other fruits, especially during the non-breeding season. The species is migratory, with some populations undertaking long-distance movements between their breeding and wintering grounds.\n\nEcologically, the Eurasian blackcap plays an important role in the ecosystem, contributing to the regulation of insect populations and the dispersal of plant seeds. It is a relatively common species, and its population is considered to be stable, though it may face some threats from habitat loss and fragmentation in certain regions.",
