  "description": "Hippoglossus hippoglossus, commonly known as the Atlantic halibut, is a large, flatfish species belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is the largest of all flatfish species, with individuals reaching lengths of up to 4.5 meters and weights of over 300 kilograms.\n\nThe Atlantic halibut is a demersal fish, living and feeding near the seafloor in cold, northern Atlantic waters. It has an asymmetrical body, with both eyes located on the upper, pigmented side of the body, and a white, underside. The mouth is large, with numerous sharp teeth adapted for catching and holding its prey, which includes other fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nHippoglossus hippoglossus is a commercially important species, and has been heavily fished, leading to population declines in many areas. Conservation efforts, including catch limits and stock management, are ongoing to help sustain this valuable fishery resource.",
