It belongs to the family Strigidae, which includes true owls.\n\nThe Oriental scops owl is a nocturnal bird with a distinctive call, often described as a repeated \"oo-oo-oo\" or \"wu-wu-wu.\" It has a small, rounded head, large eyes, and a hooked beak.

They are known to be adept at hunting from perches, using their keen eyesight and hearing to locate and capture their prey.\n\nThe Oriental scops owl is found in a wide range, spanning from the Indian subcontinent to Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia. It inhabits various forest types, including deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests, as well as well-wooded urban and suburban areas.\n\nConservation-wise, the Oriental scops owl is classified as a Least Concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), indicating that its population is stable and not currently threatened with extinction.",
