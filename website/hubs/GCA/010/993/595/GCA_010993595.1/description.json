  "description": "Petromyzon marinus, commonly known as the sea lamprey, is a species of jawless fish belonging to the order Petromyzontiformes. It is an anadromous species, meaning it spends most of its life in the ocean but returns to freshwater streams and rivers to spawn.\n\nThe sea lamprey is a long, eel-like fish with a circular, sucker-like mouth that lacks jaws. It has a single nostril on the top of its head and seven gill openings along the sides of its body. The body is typically gray or brown in color, and the adults can reach up to 1 meter in length.\n\nAs a parasitic species, the sea lamprey attaches to the bodies of other fish, using its tooth-like tongue and rasping tongue to feed on their blood and body fluids. This feeding behavior can be detrimental to commercial and recreational fish populations, which has led to efforts to control sea lamprey populations in some regions.\n\nThe sea lamprey has a complex life cycle, with a larval stage that lives in freshwater streams and metamorphoses into the parasitic adult form before migrating to the ocean. After a period of feeding and growth in the marine environment, the adults return to freshwater to spawn, completing the cycle.",
