  "description": "Triatoma infestans is a species of kissing bug (Triatominae subfamily) native to South America. It is a vector for Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, one of the most serious public health problems in Latin America.\n\nT. infestans is a blood-feeding insect that typically lives in cracks and crevices of mud-and-thatch rural homes. It is nocturnal and feeds primarily on human blood, often biting the face, leading to its common name \"kissing bug.\" Infected individuals can develop chronic Chagas disease, which can lead to severe cardiac and gastrointestinal complications.\n\nT. infestans is a large triatomine bug, typically 20-30 mm in length, with a black or dark brown body and reddish-orange markings on its abdomen. It undergoes five nymphal stages before reaching adulthood. Control and elimination of T. infestans has been a major public health priority in South America due to its role in Chagas disease transmission.",
