  "description": "Giardia intestinalis, also known as Giardia lamblia or Giardia duodenalis, is a microscopic parasitic protozoan that infects the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other vertebrates. It is a flagellated, binucleated organism that exists in two forms: the infectious cyst and the replicative trophozoite.\n\nThe cyst form is the environmentally resistant stage that can survive outside the host and is responsible for the transmission of the parasite through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Once ingested, the cyst excysts in the small intestine, releasing the trophozoite form.\n\nThe trophozoite is the active, feeding stage of the parasite that attaches to the intestinal epithelium using a ventral adhesive disc. This stage replicates and divides by binary fission, causing the symptoms of giardiasis, which include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloating, and malabsorption of nutrients.\n\nGiardia infection can be diagnosed through the detection of cysts or trophozoites in stool samples, and it is typically treated with antiparasitic medications. Proper hygiene, sanitation, and water treatment are important measures for the prevention and control of Giardia infections.",
