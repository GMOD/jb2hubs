  "description": "Cannabis sativa is a species of flowering plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is an annual herbaceous plant known for its psychoactive and medicinal properties. The plant is indigenous to Central and South Asia but has been cultivated globally for centuries.\n\nCannabis sativa plants are typically tall, with slender, serrated leaves that are palmate in shape. The plants produce small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom into a fruit known as an achene. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female individuals.\n\nThe primary active compounds in Cannabis sativa are the cannabinoids, particularly Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). These compounds interact with the endocannabinoid system in the human body, producing a range of physiological and psychological effects. The composition and concentration of these cannabinoids can vary significantly depending on the cultivar and growing conditions.\n\nCannabis sativa has a long history of use for its fiber, seeds, and medicinal properties. It continues to be a subject of intense scientific research due to its potential therapeutic applications and the complex interactions of its chemical constituents.",
