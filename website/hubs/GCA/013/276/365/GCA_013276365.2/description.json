  "description": "Canis lupus familiaris, commonly known as the domestic dog, is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Domestic dogs have been selectively bred by humans for various purposes, including companionship, hunting, herding, and guarding, resulting in a diverse range of physical and behavioral characteristics.\n\nGenetically, Canis lupus familiaris is closely related to the gray wolf, but distinct in several key aspects. Domestic dogs have a smaller brain size, a more docile temperament, and a greater diversity of coat colors and physical features compared to their wild counterparts. They also exhibit a wide range of behavioral traits, such as enhanced social cognition and the ability to communicate effectively with humans.\n\nDomestic dogs are highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of environments, from urban settings to rural areas. They play important roles in human societies, serving as working animals, service dogs, and beloved companions. The domestic dog's close relationship with humans has been a subject of extensive research in fields such as animal behavior, genetics, and evolutionary biology.",
