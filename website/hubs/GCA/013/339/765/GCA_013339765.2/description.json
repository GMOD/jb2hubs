  "description": "Haemaphysalis longicornis, commonly known as the Asian long-horned tick, is a species of hard-bodied tick that belongs to the family Ixodidae. This tick is native to East Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula, and has recently been introduced to several other regions, including the United States.\n\nHaemaphysalis longicornis is a small to medium-sized tick, with adult females measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. The distinctive feature of this species is the long, slender mouthparts (palps) that give it the \"long-horned\" appearance. The body of the tick is oval-shaped and flattened, with a leathery, brown-colored exoskeleton.\n\nThis tick is considered a three-host tick, meaning it requires three different hosts to complete its life cycle, which typically takes around one year. The life stages include egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Each stage feeds on a different host, which can include various mammals, birds, and even reptiles.\n\nHaemaphysalis longicornis is known to transmit several pathogens, including the bacteria that cause ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis, as well as the virus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). The introduction of this tick to new regions has raised concerns about the potential public health implications, as it can pose a threat to both human and animal health.",
