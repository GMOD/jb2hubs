It is found in coastal and estuarine waters of the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the east coast of Africa to the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis species is a large, predatory fish that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length and weigh up to 35 kilograms. It has a deep, laterally compressed body with a large, bony head and a prominent, upturned mouth. The eyes are relatively large, and the fish has a well-developed, streamlined appearance, which aids in its fast-swimming behavior.\n\nMegalops cyprinoides is an important commercial and recreational fish, valued for its size, fighting ability, and table quality. It feeds on a variety of prey, including smaller fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. The species is known to undertake seasonal migrations, often moving between coastal and estuarine habitats to feed and spawn.\n\nMegalops cyprinoides is an important component of coastal and estuarine ecosystems in the Indo-Pacific region, contributing to the overall biodiversity and food web dynamics of these environments.",
