  "description": "Oscheius tipulae is a species of nematode, a type of microscopic roundworm, that was first discovered in association with the tipula crane fly. It belongs to the genus Oscheius, which is part of the family Rhabditidae.\n\nOscheius tipulae is a free-living soil nematode, meaning it lives and moves freely in the soil environment, rather than being parasitic or associated with a specific host organism. It is a bacterivore, feeding on various bacteria present in the soil.\n\nThe adult Oscheius tipulae nematode is typically around 1 millimeter in length and has a cylindrical body shape. It possesses a characteristic rhabditid-type pharynx, which is a specialized feeding structure. The nematode reproduces sexually, with both males and females present in the population.\n\nOscheius tipulae has been used as a model organism in various studies, particularly in the field of nematode ecology and evolutionary biology, due to its relatively simple anatomy and ease of laboratory cultivation. Its interactions with other soil organisms and its role in nutrient cycling within the soil ecosystem are of interest to researchers.",
