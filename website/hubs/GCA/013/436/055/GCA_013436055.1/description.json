  "description": "Halocynthia roretzi, commonly known as the sea pineapple, is a species of sea squirt or ascidian that belongs to the class Ascidiacea. It is found in the coastal waters of East Asia, primarily in Japan, South Korea, and China.\n\nThe sea pineapple is a sessile, filter-feeding marine invertebrate that attaches itself to rocks, shells, or other hard substrates in the intertidal and subtidal zones. It has a distinctive pineapple-like appearance, with a tough, leathery tunic (outer covering) that can range in color from reddish-orange to purple or greenish-brown.\n\nThe body of the sea pineapple is roughly spherical or oval-shaped, with two siphons or openings: an incurrent siphon that draws in water and a excurrent siphon that expels it. The animal feeds by filtering plankton and other small particles from the water that passes through its body.\n\nHalocynthia roretzi is a hermaphroditic species, meaning each individual has both male and female reproductive organs. They reproduce through the release of sperm and eggs into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The larvae develop and eventually settle on a suitable substrate, metamorphosing into the adult form.\n\nThe sea pineapple is commercially harvested in some regions, particularly in South Korea, where it is considered a delicacy and a traditional food item. However, it is also known to accumulate heavy metals and other contaminants, which can pose a health risk if consumed in large quantities.",
