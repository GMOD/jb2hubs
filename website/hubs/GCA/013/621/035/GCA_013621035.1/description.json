The body is typically dark brown or grayish in color, with darker vertical stripes along the sides.\n\nThis species is an air-breathing catfish, possessing a specialized accessory breathing organ called a labyrinth organ, which allows it to survive in low-oxygen environments. Clarias magur is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including insects, crustaceans, and small fish.\n\nClarias magur is considered an important food fish in its native range and is widely farmed for its meat. It is also popular in the aquarium trade due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, the species is facing threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and overfishing in some areas, leading to its classification as \"Near Threatened\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
