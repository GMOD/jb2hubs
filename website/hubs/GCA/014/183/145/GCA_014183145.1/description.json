They are an important commercial and recreational species, valued for their firm, white flesh and sport fishing capabilities.\n\nBiologically, Sciaenops ocellatus is a member of the drum family, known for their ability to produce drumming sounds by vibrating their swim bladders. They are found in coastal waters, estuaries, and inshore habitats, where they play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem as both predators and prey.",
