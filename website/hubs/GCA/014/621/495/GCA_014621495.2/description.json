  "description": "Entosphenus tridentatus, commonly known as the Pacific lamprey, is a species of jawless fish belonging to the family Petromyzontidae. It is an anadromous species, meaning it spends part of its life cycle in the ocean and part in freshwater streams and rivers.\n\nThe Pacific lamprey is characterized by a long, eel-like body with a sucker-like mouth that is equipped with three rows of sharp teeth, hence the name \"tridentatus.\" It lacks jaws and scales, and instead has a cartilaginous skeleton and a slimy, scaleless skin.\n\nDuring its adult parasitic phase, the Pacific lamprey attaches itself to the bodies of larger fish, such as salmon and trout, using its sucker-like mouth to feed on their blood and bodily fluids. This parasitic behavior can have a significant impact on the populations of its host species.\n\nThe Pacific lamprey is found along the Pacific coast of North America, ranging from Baja California in Mexico to Alaska in the United States and Canada. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as prey for various predators and contributing to the nutrient cycling in the streams and rivers it inhabits.\n\nConservation efforts are underway in some regions to protect the Pacific lamprey, as its populations have declined in recent decades due to factors such as habitat loss, water pollution, and the construction of dams that impede their migratory patterns.",
