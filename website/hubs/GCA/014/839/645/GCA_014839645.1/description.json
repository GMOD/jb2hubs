They are predatory fish, feeding primarily on smaller fish, aquatic insects, and crustaceans. Xenentodon cancila is known for its remarkable ability to leap out of the water, making it a popular target for anglers.\n\nBiologically, the Xenentodon cancila is an important component of the freshwater ecosystems it inhabits, playing a role in the food web and maintaining the overall ecological balance.
