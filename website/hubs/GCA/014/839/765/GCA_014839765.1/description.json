  "description": "Sylvia borin, commonly known as the garden warbler, is a small passerine bird species belonging to the family Sylviidae. It is a migratory songbird that breeds in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia, and winters in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe garden warbler is a medium-sized warbler, approximately 14-15 cm in length, with a slender, olive-brown plumage, a pale belly, and a distinctive domed head. It has a thin, pointed bill and large, dark eyes. The species is known for its melodious, warbling song, which is often described as a rich, fluty and varied series of notes.\n\nGarden warblers typically inhabit dense, deciduous and mixed woodlands, scrublands, and gardens during the breeding season. They feed primarily on insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates, as well as berries and fruits. The species is known for its long-distance migratory behavior, traveling thousands of kilometers between its breeding and wintering grounds.\n\nThe garden warbler is a relatively common and widespread species throughout its range, and its population is considered to be stable. However, it may face threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and the use of pesticides, which can impact its food sources and breeding success.",
