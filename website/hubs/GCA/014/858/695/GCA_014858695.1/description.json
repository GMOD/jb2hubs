  "description": "Chrysomya rufifacies, commonly known as the hairy maggot blowfly or the Oriental latrine fly, is a species of blowfly that belongs to the family Calliphoridae. This species is native to Southeast Asia and has since spread to other parts of the world, including North America, South America, and Australia.\n\nChrysomya rufifacies is a medium-sized blowfly, with a body length ranging from 8 to 12 millimeters. The adult flies have a distinctive reddish-brown or bronze coloration on their faces, which gives them their common name \"hairy maggot blowfly.\" The body of the fly is covered in dense, dark-colored setae (hairs), giving it a hairy appearance.\n\nThe larvae (maggots) of Chrysomya rufifacies are known for their scavenging behavior, feeding on decaying organic matter, including animal carcasses and human feces. This makes them an important species in the decomposition process and a useful indicator of forensic evidence in criminal investigations.\n\nChrysomya rufifacies is considered a significant pest in some regions, as the larvae can infest livestock and pets, causing myiasis (the infestation of living tissue by fly larvae). Additionally, the flies can transmit various pathogens, including bacteria and parasites, which can pose a threat to human and animal health.\n\nThe species is well-known for its ability to outcompete and displace other blowfly species in areas where it has been introduced, due to its rapid development, high fecundity, and aggressive larval behavior. This has made Chrysomya rufifacies an important subject of study in the fields of forensic entomology and pest management.",
