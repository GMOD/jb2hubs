  "description": "Pygocentrus nattereri, commonly known as the red-bellied piranha, is a species of piranha found in the Amazon Basin of South America. It is a member of the Serrasalmidae family, which includes other piranha species.\n\nThe Pygocentrus nattereri is a medium-sized fish, typically reaching a length of around 25 centimeters (10 inches). It has a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with a large, powerful jaw filled with sharp, triangular teeth. The upper body is typically dark gray or olive-green, while the belly is reddish-orange, hence the common name \"red-bellied piranha.\"\n\nThese piranhas are known for their social, schooling behavior and their carnivorous feeding habits. They are opportunistic predators that feed on a variety of small aquatic animals, including fish, crustaceans, and even smaller individuals of their own species. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth allow them to rip and tear their prey.\n\nPygocentrus nattereri is native to the rivers and tributaries of the Amazon Basin, where it plays an important role in the ecosystem as a top predator. They are found in both slow-moving and fast-flowing waters, and their presence is often a sign of a healthy, balanced aquatic environment.",
