  "description": "Vanilla planifolia, also known as the Bourbon vanilla or the common vanilla, is a species of orchid that is widely cultivated for its sweet-smelling seed pods, which are the source of the popular vanilla flavoring.\n\nVanilla planifolia is a perennial, climbing vine that can grow up to 30 meters in length. It has large, oblong-shaped leaves and produces greenish-yellow flowers that mature into long, slender pods. The pods, when cured and dried, contain tiny black seeds that release the characteristic vanilla aroma and flavor.\n\nThe plant is native to central and south America, particularly in regions of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It thrives in warm, humid, tropical environments and requires partial shade for optimal growth.\n\nVanilla planifolia is an economically important crop, as it is the source of the majority of the world's vanilla supply. The labor-intensive curing and drying process of the pods contributes to vanilla's status as one of the most expensive spices globally. The unique flavor compounds in vanilla, such as vanillin, make it a highly sought-after ingredient in a wide range of food, beverage, and fragrance products.",
