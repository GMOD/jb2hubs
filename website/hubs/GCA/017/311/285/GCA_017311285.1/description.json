  "description": "Pneumocystis oryctolagi is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Pneumocystis. It is an opportunistic pathogen that primarily infects rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), causing a respiratory disease known as Pneumocystis pneumonia.\n\nPneumocystis oryctolagi is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that is classified within the fungal kingdom. It is an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning it can only survive and replicate within the host's cells, specifically the alveolar epithelial cells of the lungs.\n\nThe life cycle of Pneumocystis oryctolagi involves two main stages: the trophic form and the cystic form. The trophic form is the metabolically active stage, which multiplies within the host's cells. The cystic form is the dormant, spore-like stage, which is responsible for transmission between hosts.\n\nPneumocystis oryctolagi infection can cause severe respiratory distress and pneumonia in immunocompromised rabbits, such as those with underlying health conditions or those receiving immunosuppressive treatments. The infection can lead to the accumulation of fluid and cellular debris in the alveoli, impairing gas exchange and causing respiratory failure if left untreated.\n\nDiagnosis of Pneumocystis oryctolagi infection typically involves microscopic examination of respiratory samples, such as bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum, to detect the presence of the fungal organisms. Effective treatment often involves the use of antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, to eliminate the infection and manage the associated respiratory symptoms.",
