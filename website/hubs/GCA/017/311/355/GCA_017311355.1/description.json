  "description": "Bos frontalis, commonly known as the gaur, is a species of wild cattle native to the forests and grasslands of South and Southeast Asia. It is the largest living bovine species and is characterized by its distinctive white stockings, a white-rimmed muzzle, and a prominent boss or hump on the forehead.\n\nGaurs are typically dark brown to black in color, with the males often appearing more massive and robust than the females. They are known for their impressive horns, which curve upwards and outwards, and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) in adult males.\n\nGaurs are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses, leaves, and other vegetation. They are known to live in herds, with a dominant bull leading the group. Gaurs are considered vulnerable to extinction due to habitat loss, poaching, and competition with domestic livestock.\n\nConservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic species, which plays an important role in the ecological balance of the forests and grasslands it inhabits.",
