  "description": "Pluvialis apricaria, commonly known as the Eurasian golden plover, is a species of shorebird belonging to the plover family. It is a medium-sized wading bird with a rounded body, short neck, and long legs.\n\nThe Eurasian golden plover has a distinctive breeding plumage, with a black belly and upper parts that are golden-speckled, giving it a striking appearance. During the non-breeding season, the bird's plumage becomes more muted, with a grayish-brown back and white underparts.\n\nThese birds primarily feed on insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates, which they forage for in a variety of habitats, including tundra, moorlands, and agricultural fields. They are known for their impressive migratory behavior, with some populations traveling long distances between their breeding and wintering grounds.\n\nThe Eurasian golden plover is widely distributed across northern Eurasia, breeding in the Arctic regions and wintering in more temperate areas. Its population is considered to be stable, and it is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
