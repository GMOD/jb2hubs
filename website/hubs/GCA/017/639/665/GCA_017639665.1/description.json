This stork is native to South America, found primarily in the wetlands and marshes of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern Argentina.\n\nThe Maguari Stork is a striking bird, standing approximately 1.2 meters tall with a wingspan of around 2.3 meters. Its plumage is predominantly white, with black wings and tail feathers. The species has a long, straight, and pointed bill, which it uses to forage for a variety of prey, including small mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates.\n\nCiconia maguari is a social bird, often found in small groups or flocks. They engage in courtship displays, which involve bill-clattering and graceful aerial maneuvers. The species builds large, platform-like nests, typically in trees or on cliffs, where they lay and incubate their eggs.\n\nThe Maguari Stork is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as its population remains relatively stable. However, the species faces threats from habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural expansion and other human activities in its native range.",
