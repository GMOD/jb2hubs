  "description": "Gymnogyps californianus, commonly known as the California condor, is a large, critically endangered species of vulture native to the western coast of North America. This scavenger bird is the largest flying land bird in North America, with a wingspan that can reach up to 9.8 feet (3 meters).\n\nThe California condor has a distinctive black plumage with a bald, pinkish-orange head and neck. Its unique physical features include a long, hooked beak, sharp talons, and a highly acute sense of smell that helps it locate carrion from great distances.\n\nThis species is a social, non-migratory bird that lives in rugged, mountainous terrain and nests in caves or on cliff ledges. The California condor plays a vital role in the ecosystem by cleaning up carcasses and preventing the spread of diseases. However, the population of this species experienced a severe decline in the 20th century due to factors such as lead poisoning, hunting, and habitat loss.\n\nExtensive conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs, have helped to increase the population of the California condor in recent decades, but it remains one of the rarest and most critically endangered bird species in the world.",
