  "description": "Chromera velia CCMP2878 is a photosynthetic alveolate protist that was first isolated from the coral Plesiastrea versipora in Sydney Harbor, Australia. It is a member of the phylum Chromerida, which is closely related to the apicomplexan parasites and the dinoflagellates.\n\nChromera velia CCMP2878 is a unicellular organism with a complex cell structure that includes a nucleus, mitochondria, and a plastid surrounded by four membranes, indicating its evolutionary origins from a secondary endosymbiotic event. The plastid contains chlorophyll a and c2, as well as carotenoids, and the organism is capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Chromera velia CCMP2878 is a distinct lineage within the Chromerida, and it is considered a valuable model organism for understanding the evolution and biology of these enigmatic algae and their relationships with other alveolates. The availability of its genome sequence has further enhanced the potential of this species for research into the evolutionary origins and adaptations of photosynthetic alveolates.",
