  "description": "Micropterus salmoides, commonly known as the largemouth bass, is a freshwater fish species that belongs to the sunfish family, Centrarchidae. It is native to the eastern and central United States, as well as the northern part of Mexico.\n\nThe largemouth bass is a predatory fish that can grow up to 24 inches (61 cm) in length and can weigh up to 8 pounds (3.6 kg). It has a distinct, large, protruding lower jaw that extends past the upper jaw, giving it a large, open mouth. The body of the largemouth bass is typically olive-green or dark green on the back, with a white or pale belly, and a dark, horizontal stripe along the side.\n\nLargemouth bass are known for their aggressive feeding behavior, preying on a variety of small fish, crustaceans, and amphibians. They are an important game fish, popular among anglers for their strong fighting ability and their willingness to strike artificial lures. Largemouth bass have been widely introduced outside their native range, and are now found in many countries around the world, where they are both valued as a sport fish and sometimes considered an invasive species.",
