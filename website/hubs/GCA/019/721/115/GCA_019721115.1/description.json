  "description": "Astyanax mexicanus, commonly known as the Mexican tetra or cave fish, is a small freshwater fish species native to parts of Mexico and the southern United States. It belongs to the family Characidae, which includes various types of characin fishes.\n\nThis species is notable for its intriguing adaptations to cave environments. Some populations of A. mexicanus live in perpetual darkness, having evolved reduced or absent eyes and pigmentation, a common trait among cave-dwelling organisms. These cave-dwelling forms are known as the blind cave tetra or Pach√≥n cavefish.\n\nIn contrast, other populations of A. mexicanus live in surface waters and have fully developed eyes and pigmentation. These surface-dwelling forms are sometimes referred to as the surface fish or eyed form.\n\nThe Mexican tetra is an important model organism in evolutionary biology and developmental biology research, as the species provides insights into the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying the evolution of cave-adapted traits. Studying this species has contributed to our understanding of the processes of adaptation, convergent evolution, and developmental plasticity.",
