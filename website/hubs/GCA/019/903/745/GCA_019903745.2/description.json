  "description": "Rangifer tarandus caribou, commonly known as the woodland caribou, is a subspecies of the caribou (Rangifer tarandus) found in North America. It is a large, hoofed mammal that is closely related to the reindeer found in Eurasia.\n\nThe woodland caribou is typically smaller in size compared to other caribou subspecies, with a shoulder height of around 1.1 to 1.5 meters and a weight ranging from 150 to 300 kilograms. They have a thick, brown fur coat that helps them adapt to the cold, northern environments they inhabit. Their distinctive antlers, which can reach up to 1.5 meters in length, are present in both males and females.\n\nWoodland caribou are adapted to live in boreal forests, tundra, and mountain regions, where they feed on a variety of vegetation, including lichens, mosses, and grasses. They are known for their migratory behavior, traveling between their summer and winter ranges, often covering long distances in search of food and suitable habitat.\n\nDue to habitat loss, fragmentation, and other human-related impacts, the woodland caribou is considered a threatened species in many parts of its range. Conservation efforts, such as habitat protection and population monitoring, are essential for the long-term survival of this iconic North American species.",
