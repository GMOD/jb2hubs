  "description": "Apus apus, commonly known as the common swift or European swift, is a small bird species belonging to the swift family, Apodidae. This migratory bird is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa, and is known for its distinctive black plumage and its remarkable aerial abilities.\n\nThe common swift is a highly specialized aerial forager, spending most of its life in the air, even sleeping and mating on the wing. With its long, slender wings and streamlined body, the Apus apus is able to perform remarkable aerial maneuvers, including high-speed dives and sharp turns, as it hunts for insects, its primary food source.\n\nThese birds are known for their impressive endurance, with some individuals capable of staying aloft for several months at a time, only briefly landing to breed and nest. The Apus apus nests in small colonies, often in the crevices of buildings or under the eaves of houses, where they construct simple nests using twigs, feathers, and other materials collected in flight.\n\nThe common swift is an important indicator species, as its population trends can reflect the overall health of the ecosystem, particularly the availability of aerial insects. Changes in their numbers can provide valuable insights into the impacts of climate change, urbanization, and other environmental factors on the broader avian community.",
