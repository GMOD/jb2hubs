Lemur catta belongs to the family Lemuridae and is one of the most well-known and iconic primates.\n\nPhysically, Lemur catta is characterized by its distinctive black-and-white striped tail, which can be as long as its body.

Their fur is typically gray or reddish-brown in color, with a white underbelly.\n\nBehaviorally, Lemur catta is a highly social and diurnal species, living in large, multi-male, multi-female troops. They are known for their complex social interactions, including complex communication through vocalizations, scent-marking, and body language. Lemur catta is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of plants, fruits, flowers, and even small invertebrates.\n\nEcologically, Lemur catta plays an important role in the maintenance of the dry, deciduous forests of Madagascar, serving as seed dispersers and pollinators. However, the species is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, hunting, and other threats.",
