  "description": "Hemiprocne comata, commonly known as the whiskered treeswift, is a species of bird found in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hemiprocnidae, which includes the treeswifts.\n\nThe whiskered treeswift is a small, slender bird with a distinctive appearance. It has a rounded head, a short, hooked bill, and long, pointed wings. The plumage is mostly dark grey or black, with a white belly and a prominent white \"whisker\" stripe extending from the bill to the eye.\n\nThese birds are known for their graceful, acrobatic flight, which they use to catch insects in the air. They are found in various habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, as well as urban areas with tall trees.\n\nHemiprocne comata is a migratory species, with some populations moving to different regions during the breeding season. They nest in tree cavities or on branches, and both parents participate in the incubation and care of the young.\n\nThe whiskered treeswift is not considered to be threatened, and its population is believed to be stable. However, it may be affected by habitat loss and degradation in some areas of its range.",
