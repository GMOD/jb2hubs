  "description": "Hemiscyllium ocellatum, commonly known as the Ocellated Epaulette Shark, is a species of small, nocturnal shark that belongs to the family Hemiscylliidae. This species is native to the Indo-Pacific region, where it can be found in shallow, tropical waters near coral reefs and rocky areas.\n\nThe Ocellated Epaulette Shark is characterized by its distinctive body shape and coloration. It has a flattened, disc-like body with large, wing-like pectoral fins and a short, rounded snout. The shark's dorsal surface is typically brown or grayish-brown, with several distinct, eye-like spots (ocelli) along the sides and back. These ocelli help the shark blend in with its surrounding environment, providing camouflage.\n\nOne of the unique adaptations of the Ocellated Epaulette Shark is its ability to \"walk\" along the seafloor using its pectoral and pelvic fins. This specialized mode of locomotion allows the shark to navigate through complex, reef-like habitats and hunt for small crustaceans, mollusks, and small bony fishes, which make up the majority of its diet.\n\nThe Ocellated Epaulette Shark is generally considered harmless to humans and is not a target of commercial fisheries. However, it may be vulnerable to habitat degradation and loss due to human activities, such as coastal development and pollution, which can impact the health of coral reef ecosystems.",
