  "description": "The Trogon surrucura, also known as the surucua trogon, is a species of trogon bird native to southeastern Brazil, northeastern Argentina, and eastern Paraguay. It is a medium-sized bird, measuring around 25-28 cm in length.\n\nThe Trogon surrucura has a distinctive appearance, with a vibrant plumage. The male bird has a bright green head, back, and chest, with a bright red belly and undertail coverts. The wings are black with white bars, and the tail is black and white. The female has a duller, olive-green plumage with a yellowish belly.\n\nThese birds are predominantly arboreal, inhabiting forests and wooded areas. They are known for their unique feeding behavior, where they perch and wait patiently for insects, fruits, and small vertebrates to come within reach, before snatching them with a quick movement.\n\nThe Trogon surrucura is an important part of the local ecosystem, playing a role in seed dispersal and insect control. However, their populations have faced some decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation in their native range.",
