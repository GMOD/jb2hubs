  "description": "Diceros bicornis minor, commonly known as the southern white rhinoceros or the southwest black rhinoceros, is a subspecies of the white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) native to southern Africa. It is one of the five recognized subspecies of the white rhinoceros.\n\nThe Diceros bicornis minor is characterized by its distinctive two horns, with the front horn being significantly larger than the rear horn. It is a large, herbivorous mammal, with a stocky, barrel-shaped body and thick, armored skin. The subspecies is typically smaller in size compared to the northern white rhinoceros, with adult males weighing between 1,800 to 3,600 kg and standing around 1.5 to 1.8 meters tall at the shoulder.\n\nThe southern white rhinoceros is primarily grazing herbivores, feeding on a variety of grasses, shrubs, and other vegetation. They are known for their strong social bonds, living in small family groups or larger herds, and are typically non-aggressive towards humans unless provoked or threatened.\n\nDue to poaching and habitat loss, the Diceros bicornis minor is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, with ongoing conservation efforts to protect and restore their populations across southern Africa.",
