  "description": "Passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus, commonly known as the Savannah Sparrow, is a subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). It is a small, brown and gray songbird native to western North America.\n\nThe Passerculus sandwichensis alaudinus subspecies is characterized by its relatively long, pointed bill and its distinctive yellow supercilium (eyebrow stripe) and malar (cheek) markings. It has a streaked brown and gray plumage on its back and wings, with a white or buffy breast and belly. This subspecies is slightly smaller and paler in coloration compared to other Savannah Sparrow subspecies.\n\nPasserculus sandwichensis alaudinus is found in a variety of open, grassy habitats, including meadows, prairies, pastures, and agricultural fields. It feeds primarily on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. The Savannah Sparrow is known for its simple, buzzy song, which is often used in territorial and courtship behaviors.\n\nThis subspecies plays a role in the ecosystem as a prey species for various predators, and it also contributes to the dispersal of seeds through its foraging activities. Conservation efforts for the Savannah Sparrow focus on maintaining and protecting its preferred grassland and agricultural habitats.",
