  "description": "Laterallus jamaicensis coturniculus, commonly known as the California black rail, is a subspecies of the black rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) that is found in coastal regions of California, USA, and the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.\n\nThe California black rail is a small, elusive marsh bird that measures approximately 12-15 cm in length. It has a dark, almost black plumage, with a slender bill and long toes that allow it to move easily through dense vegetation. The species is primarily nocturnal and secretive, making it difficult to observe in the wild.\n\nThe California black rail inhabits saltwater and brackish marshes, as well as freshwater wetlands, where it nests and forages for small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and crustaceans. The species is known for its distinctive call, a series of high-pitched \"kik-kik-kerr\" notes that can be heard during the breeding season.\n\nThe California black rail is considered a threatened subspecies due to habitat loss and degradation, as well as other anthropogenic factors, such as sea-level rise and predation by non-native species. Conservation efforts for this subspecies focus on protecting and restoring its sensitive wetland habitats to ensure its long-term survival.",
