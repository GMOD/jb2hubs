  "description": "Grapholita molesta, commonly known as the Oriental fruit moth, is a small moth species that belongs to the family Tortricidae. It is considered a significant pest of various fruit crops, particularly stone fruits such as peaches, nectarines, and apricots.\n\nThe adult G. molesta moth has a wingspan of approximately 12-15 millimeters. The forewings are greyish-brown with darker markings, while the hindwings are grey. The larvae, or caterpillars, are typically white or pinkish in color and can reach up to 10 millimeters in length.\n\nThe life cycle of G. molesta involves multiple generations per year, with the number of generations varying depending on the geographic location and climatic conditions. The moths lay their eggs on the surface of host plants, and the larvae feed on the young shoots, buds, and fruit of the host plants, causing significant damage to the crop.\n\nG. molesta is widely distributed across North America, Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world, and its management often involves the use of integrated pest management strategies, including the use of pheromone-based monitoring and mating disruption techniques, as well as the application of selective insecticides.",
