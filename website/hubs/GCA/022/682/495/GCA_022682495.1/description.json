  "description": "Desmodus rotundus, commonly known as the common vampire bat, is a species of bat native to Central and South America. It is a member of the family Phyllostomidae, which includes various species of leaf-nosed bats.\n\nThe common vampire bat is a small, nocturnal mammal with a distinctive appearance. It has a flattened head, large ears, and a sharp, needle-like tongue adapted for feeding on the blood of its prey. The bat's body is typically a reddish-brown color, and it has a wingspan of around 30-40 cm.\n\nDesmodus rotundus is highly specialized for a hematophagous (blood-feeding) lifestyle. It uses its sharp teeth to make a small incision in the skin of its prey, often livestock or occasionally humans, and then laps up the flowing blood. The bat's saliva contains anticoagulant and anesthetic properties that aid in this process.\n\nThese bats are typically found in caves, abandoned buildings, or other sheltered roosts, where they live in colonies. They are known for their highly organized social structure and complex communication patterns within their groups.\n\nWhile the common vampire bat is not considered a significant threat to human health, it can transmit diseases such as rabies to both animals and humans. As a result, it is an important subject of study in the fields of ecology, animal behavior, and public health.",
