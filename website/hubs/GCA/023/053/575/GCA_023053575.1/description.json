  "description": "Branchinecta lynchi, commonly known as the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp, is a small freshwater crustacean species belonging to the order Anostraca. It is found in temporary vernal pools and other seasonal wetlands in the western United States, primarily in California.\n\nThe Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp is a small, translucent, and delicate-looking creature, typically measuring between 10-20 millimeters in length. It has a segmented body, a pair of large compound eyes, and 11 pairs of swimming legs that it uses to propel itself through the water. The species is adapted to the ephemeral nature of the vernal pools it inhabits, with its eggs able to remain dormant for extended periods and hatch when the pools fill with water during the rainy season.\n\nBranchinecta lynchi plays an important role in the ecosystem of vernal pools, serving as a food source for various aquatic predators. It is also considered an indicator species, as its presence and abundance can provide information about the overall health and integrity of the vernal pool habitats it occupies. Due to the rarity and sensitivity of these ecosystems, the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp is listed as a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.",
