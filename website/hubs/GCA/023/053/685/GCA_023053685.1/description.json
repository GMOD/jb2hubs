  "description": "Diadophis punctatus similis, commonly known as the southern ringneck snake, is a subspecies of the ringneck snake (Diadophis punctatus) that is native to the southeastern United States. This small, slender snake typically measures between 10 to 20 inches in length and is characterized by its distinctive ring-like pattern around the neck.\n\nThe southern ringneck snake has a smooth, shiny, and iridescent body that can range in color from gray, brown, or olive-green on the dorsal (upper) side, with a vibrant yellow, orange, or red underside. The species is easily recognized by the single, complete band of color around the neck, which is typically bright orange or red.\n\nThese snakes are primarily terrestrial and prefer habitats such as moist, wooded areas, rocky hillsides, and urban areas with sufficient cover, such as logs, leaf litter, or human-made structures. They are primarily nocturnal and feed on a variety of small prey, including insects, spiders, small amphibians, and other small reptiles.\n\nDiadophis punctatus similis is a non-venomous snake and is generally considered harmless to humans, although they may defensively coil or release a musky odor when threatened. The southern ringneck snake plays an important role in the ecosystem as a predator and contributes to the natural balance of its local environment.",
