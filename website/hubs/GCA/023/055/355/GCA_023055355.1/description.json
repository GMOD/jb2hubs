  "description": "Agelaius tricolor, commonly known as the Tricolored Blackbird, is a species of songbird native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Icteridae, which includes blackbirds, orioles, and meadowlarks.\n\nThe Tricolored Blackbird is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring between 18-22 cm in length and weighing around 50-65 grams. Its plumage is distinctive, with a dark black body, bright red shoulder patches, and white wing bars, which give it a \"tricolored\" appearance.\n\nThese birds are highly social and often breed in large colonies, sometimes numbering in the tens of thousands. They feed primarily on insects, seeds, and grains, and are known to be opportunistic foragers, taking advantage of a variety of food sources.\n\nThe Tricolored Blackbird is considered a species of conservation concern due to declining population numbers in recent decades, primarily due to habitat loss and degradation of their breeding and foraging areas. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting and restoring wetland and grassland habitats that are essential for the species' survival.",
