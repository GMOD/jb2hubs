  "description": "Juglans californica, commonly known as the California black walnut, is a species of walnut tree native to the southwestern United States, particularly in the state of California. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 60 feet (18 meters) tall, with a broad, spreading canopy and a thick, furrowed bark.\n\nThe leaves of Juglans californica are compound, with 7 to 11 leaflets that are typically lanceolate in shape and have serrated edges. The trees produce green, oval-shaped fruits that mature into a hard, woody nut enclosed in a green husk. The nuts are edible and have a distinctive flavor, which has led to the species being cultivated for its nuts.\n\nJuglans californica is an important component of the native plant communities in which it is found, providing food and shelter for a variety of wildlife species. The tree is adapted to thrive in the Mediterranean-type climate of California, with its ability to tolerate drought and its resistance to pests and diseases.\n\nBotanically, Juglans californica belongs to the genus Juglans, which includes several other species of walnut trees. It is closely related to the Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) and is sometimes considered a subspecies or variety of that species.",
