  "description": "Charina bottae, commonly known as the rubber boa, is a small, non-venomous snake species native to western North America. It belongs to the family Boidae, a group of snakes that includes boas and pythons.\n\nThe rubber boa is a relatively small snake, typically reaching a length of around 45-60 cm (18-24 inches). It has a stout, cylindrical body and a rounded, blunt head, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The snake's skin is smooth and velvety, with a coloration that can range from various shades of brown to grey or black, often with a lighter underside.\n\nOne of the unique features of the rubber boa is its heat-sensing pits, which are located on the sides of its head. These pits allow the snake to detect the body heat of its prey, which includes small rodents, birds, and lizards. The rubber boa is known for its ability to constrict and subdue its prey, similar to other boa species.\n\nRubber boas are typically found in a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, and rocky areas, often in close proximity to water sources. They are known for their docile temperament and are rarely aggressive towards humans.\n\nThe rubber boa is an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits, playing a role in the regulation of small mammal and reptile populations. It is also valued for its unique physical characteristics and behavior, making it a popular species among herpetologists and nature enthusiasts.",
