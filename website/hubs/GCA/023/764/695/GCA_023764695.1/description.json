  "description": "Pygathrix nigripes, also known as the black-shanked douc langur, is a species of Old World monkey found in the tropical forests of Vietnam and Cambodia. It is a member of the doucs (genus Pygathrix), a group of arboreal primates closely related to the langurs.\n\nThe black-shanked douc langur is characterized by its distinctive coloration, with black legs, white arms, and a reddish-orange body. Its face is framed by white fur, and it has a distinctive tuft of black hair on its head. This species is highly adapted to an arboreal lifestyle, with long limbs and a prehensile tail that assist in moving through the forest canopy.\n\nPygathrix nigripes is an herbivorous species, feeding primarily on leaves, fruits, and flowers. They live in small social groups and are known for their complex social behaviors, including grooming, vocalizations, and territorial displays.\n\nThis species is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal wildlife trade. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect the remaining populations of this unique and visually striking primate.",
