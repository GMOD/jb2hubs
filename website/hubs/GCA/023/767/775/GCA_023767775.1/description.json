  "description": "Pongo pygmaeus, commonly known as the Bornean orangutan, is a species of great ape native to the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. They are the largest arboreal mammal and the only great ape found outside of Africa.\n\nPhysically, Pongo pygmaeus are characterized by their distinctive reddish-brown fur, long arms, and large, powerful hands and feet that are adapted for moving through the dense tropical forests they inhabit. Adult males can weigh up to 130 kg and stand up to 1.3 meters tall, while females are typically smaller, weighing around 45 kg.\n\nBehaviorally, Pongo pygmaeus are primarily solitary and arboreal, spending most of their time in the canopy of the forest, where they feed on a variety of fruits, leaves, bark, and insects. They are known for their advanced tool use and cognitive abilities, which include the use of leaves as umbrellas and the construction of complex sleeping nests.\n\nPongo pygmaeus are classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their remaining forest habitats and reducing human-wildlife conflicts.",
