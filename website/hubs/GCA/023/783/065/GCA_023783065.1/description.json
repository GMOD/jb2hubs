  "description": "Nomascus siki, commonly known as the Cao Vit Gibbon or the Hainan Gibbon, is a species of gibbon native to the Cao Vit Gibbon Nature Reserve in northeastern Vietnam and the adjacent Guangxi province of China. This primate is a small, arboreal ape belonging to the family Hylobatidae.\n\nThe Nomascus siki is characterized by its distinct black and white fur coloration, with adult males having a black body and white cheeks, while adult females have a pale-colored body. They typically weigh between 6 to 8 kilograms and measure around 50 to 60 centimeters in length.\n\nThese gibbons are known for their complex and melodious vocalizations, which they use for communication and territorial marking. They live in small, family-based social groups and are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and flowers.\n\nThe Cao Vit Gibbon is considered one of the rarest and most endangered primates in the world, with an estimated population of only around 110 individuals. Habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting, are the primary threats to the species' survival. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of protected areas and anti-poaching measures, are crucial for the long-term preservation of this unique primate.",
