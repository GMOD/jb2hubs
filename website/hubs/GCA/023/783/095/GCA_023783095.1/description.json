  "description": "Macaca assamensis, commonly known as the Assam macaque, is a species of Old World monkey native to the eastern Himalayas and surrounding regions. It is a medium-sized primate with a robust build and a distinctive facial structure characterized by a prominent brow ridge and a pronounced snout.\n\nThe Assam macaque has a thick, shaggy coat that ranges in color from dark brown to gray, with a lighter underside. They are highly adaptable and can be found in various habitats, including subtropical and temperate forests, as well as grasslands and rocky areas.\n\nThese primates are primarily arboreal, but they also spend a significant amount of time on the ground foraging for a diverse diet that includes fruits, leaves, seeds, insects, and small vertebrates. They live in social groups led by a dominant female and her offspring, with adult males often forming separate, hierarchical groups.\n\nMacaca assamensis is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting pressure. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their remaining populations and habitats, as well as promoting sustainable management practices in the regions where they are found.",
