  "description": "Erythrocebus patas, commonly known as the patas monkey or the red monkey, is a species of Old World monkey native to Africa. It is the largest member of the guenon group of monkeys.\n\nThe patas monkey is characterized by its distinctive reddish-orange coat, which is longer and shaggier than other guenon species. It has a relatively long tail and a characteristically long, slender limb structure, which allows it to run at high speeds of up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h) over long distances.\n\nThese monkeys are primarily terrestrial and diurnal, spending most of their time foraging and moving on the ground in large, multi-male, multi-female social groups. Their diet consists mainly of grasses, seeds, fruits, and insects.\n\nPatas monkeys are found in the savannas and semi-deserts of West and Central Africa, ranging from Senegal to Ethiopia. They are known for their adaptability to arid environments and their ability to thrive in areas with limited water resources.\n\nOverall, the patas monkey is a fascinating primate species that showcases unique adaptations to its challenging, open-habitat environment in Africa.",
