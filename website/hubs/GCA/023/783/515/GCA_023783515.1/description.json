  "description": "Chlorocebus aethiops, commonly known as the vervet monkey, is a species of Old World monkey native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the genus Chlorocebus, which includes several closely related species of arboreal monkeys.\n\nVervet monkeys are medium-sized primates, typically weighing between 4 to 8 kilograms. They have a distinctive coloration, with a gray or olive-gray coat, black face, and white fur around the eyes, mouth, and groin area. Their tails are long and they have a well-developed thumb, which aids in their arboreal lifestyle.\n\nThese monkeys are highly social and live in multi-male, multi-female troops, often led by a dominant female. They are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, insects, and small vertebrates. Vervets are known for their complex social behaviors, including vocal communication, grooming, and conflict resolution strategies.\n\nVervet monkeys are widely distributed across eastern and southern Africa, inhabiting a range of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and even urban areas. They are generally considered to be of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although some populations may face threats from habitat loss, hunting, and human-wildlife conflict.",
