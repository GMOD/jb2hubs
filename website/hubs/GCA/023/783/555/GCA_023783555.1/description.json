  "description": "Ateles geoffroyi, also known as the black-handed spider monkey, is a species of New World monkey found in the tropical forests of Central America. It is a member of the Atelidae family, which includes other spider monkey species.\n\nKey features of the Ateles geoffroyi:\n\n1. Morphology:\n   - They have a slender, elongated build with long, prehensile tails and limbs, which are adaptations for an arboreal lifestyle.\n   - Their hands lack a thumb, giving them a \"spider-like\" appearance, hence the common name \"spider monkey.\"\n   - The fur color ranges from black to brown, with a distinctive black or dark gray band on the hands.\n\n2. Behavior and Ecology:\n   - Ateles geoffroyi are highly social and arboreal primates, living in small to medium-sized troops or bands.\n   - They are primarily frugivorous, but also supplement their diet with leaves, flowers, and occasional insects.\n   - They are known for their agile and acrobatic movements, using their prehensile tails for balance and support during locomotion.\n   - They play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers, contributing to the regeneration of the tropical forests.\n\n3. Conservation Status:\n   - Ateles geoffroyi is classified as \"Endangered\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\n   - The primary threats to their populations include habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for the pet trade and bushmeat.\n   - Conservation efforts focus on protecting the remaining tropical forest habitats and promoting sustainable management practices.\n\nOverall, the Ateles geoffroyi is a unique and ecologically important primate species that is facing significant challenges to its long-term survival in the wild.",
