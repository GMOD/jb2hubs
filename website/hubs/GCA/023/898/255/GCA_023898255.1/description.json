  "description": "Nycticebus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal slow loris, is a nocturnal primate species belonging to the family Lorisidae. It is found in the tropical forests of northeastern India, Bangladesh, and parts of Myanmar.\n\nThe Bengal slow loris is a small, stocky primate with large, expressive eyes and a rounded head. It has a distinctive dark facial mask and a fur coat that ranges in color from reddish-brown to greyish-brown. Its limbs are adapted for an arboreal lifestyle, with long, slender digits and strong grasping abilities.\n\nThese slow lorises are solitary and territorial, using a combination of vocalizations, scent-marking, and visual displays to communicate with conspecifics. They are primarily frugivorous, but also feed on insects, small vertebrates, and exudates from plants.\n\nNycticebus bengalensis is known for its unique defensive mechanism, which involves the secretion of a toxin from a gland on its elbow. This toxin can be mixed with saliva and used to inflict a painful and potentially dangerous bite.\n\nThe conservation status of the Bengal slow loris is classified as 'Vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to habitat loss and the illegal pet trade. Efforts are ongoing to protect this species and its fragile forest habitats.",
