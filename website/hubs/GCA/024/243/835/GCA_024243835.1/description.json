  "description": "Enteropsectra breve is a species of small, freshwater copepod crustacean. It belongs to the family Cyclopidae, which includes many common pond and lake-dwelling cyclopoid copepods.\n\nE. breve is typically less than 1 millimeter in length as an adult. It has a streamlined, cylindrical body form typical of cyclopoid copepods. Like other cyclopoids, it has a single, fused head and thorax region, and a smaller, segmented abdomen.\n\nE. breve feeds on a variety of microscopic algae and detritus in the water column and on submerged surfaces. It plays a role in aquatic food webs as both a consumer and prey item for larger invertebrates and small vertebrates.\n\nAs a widely distributed freshwater species, E. breve can be found in lentic (standing) water habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams across temperate regions. It is an important component of the zooplankton community in these ecosystems.",
