  "description": "**Enteropsectra breve** is a species of **Microsporidia**, which are a large phylum of obligate intracellular parasites related to fungi. These microscopic organisms are known to infect a wide range of animals.\n\n\n\n### Key Characteristics:\n\n\n\n* **Parasitic Nature**: *Enteropsectra breve* is an obligate intracellular parasite, meaning it can only replicate inside the cells of a host organism.\n\n* **Host Specificity**: This species specifically infects **nematodes**, particularly the intestinal cells of *Oscheius tipulae*. \n\n* **Morphology**: It is characterized by forming **small, rod-shaped, or crescent-shaped spores** within the host's intestinal cells. These spores tend to align along the apical side of the host's intestinal cells.\n\n* **Exit Mechanism**: Unlike some other microsporidia that exit host cells via exocytosis, *Enteropsectra breve* (and other *Enteropsectra* species) exit by **budding off the host cell's plasma membrane**.\n\n* **Genomics**: *Enteropsectra breve* has a relatively large genome for a microsporidian, around 6.0 megabases, and also has a high number of predicted proteins (around 3531) compared to other nematode-infecting microsporidia. It retains RNAi pathway proteins, which are lost in some other microsporidian lineages.\n\n* **Phylogenetic Placement**: *Enteropsectra breve* belongs to a clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens, positioning it as a sister group to the genus *Enterocytozoon*.\n\n",
