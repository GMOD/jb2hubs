  "description": "Setophaga petechia, commonly known as the yellow warbler, is a small songbird species belonging to the warbler family Parulidae. It is native to North America, with a breeding range spanning from Alaska and Canada down to Central America.\n\nThe yellow warbler is a vibrant, yellow-colored bird with distinctive chestnut-colored streaks on its underparts. It has a slender bill, dark eyes, and a long, thin tail. Males and females exhibit similar plumage, although males tend to have more intense coloration.\n\nThese warblers are known for their melodic, high-pitched songs, often described as a series of \"sweet, sweet, sweet\" notes. They primarily feed on insects, including caterpillars, spiders, and other small invertebrates, which they forage for in the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSetophaga petechia is a migratory species, spending the breeding season in North America and wintering in parts of Central and South America. They are found in a variety of habitats, including deciduous and mixed forests, shrublands, and urban areas with suitable vegetation.\n\nThe yellow warbler is a common and widespread species, and its population is considered to be stable. It is an important component of many North American avian communities and plays a key role in the ecosystem through its insect-consuming behavior.",
