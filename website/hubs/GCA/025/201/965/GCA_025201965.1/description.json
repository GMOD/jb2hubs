  "description": "Gopherus flavomarginatus, commonly known as the Bolson tortoise, is a species of tortoise native to the Bolson de Mapim√≠ region of northern Mexico. This large terrestrial reptile is a member of the Gopherus genus, which includes several species of North American gopher tortoises.\n\nThe Bolson tortoise is characterized by its distinctive yellow-margined carapace (upper shell) and dark brown to black coloration. Adults can grow to a shell length of up to 50 cm (20 inches) and weigh up to 20 kg (44 pounds), making it one of the largest tortoise species in North America.\n\nGopherus flavomarginatus is adapted to the arid, desert environments of its native range, exhibiting a number of specialized traits. It constructs deep, multi-chambered burrows that provide shelter from extreme temperatures and predators. The tortoise's diet consists primarily of grasses, succulents, and other desert vegetation.\n\nThe Bolson tortoise is classified as Endangered by the IUCN due to habitat loss, overexploitation, and predation by introduced species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and threatened species within its limited geographic distribution.",
