  "description": "Camponotus vicinus, also known as the western carpenter ant, is a species of ant that belongs to the genus Camponotus, commonly referred to as the carpenter ants. This species is native to western North America, ranging from British Columbia in Canada to Baja California in Mexico.\n\nCamponotus vicinus is a medium-sized ant, with workers typically measuring between 7-13 millimeters in length. They have a black or dark brown body with reddish-brown legs and antennae. These ants are known for their ability to construct nests within the wood of trees, stumps, or even structures, earning them the \"carpenter ant\" moniker.\n\nThe colony structure of Camponotus vicinus is characterized by a queen, workers, and, during certain times of the year, reproductive individuals such as males and winged females. The workers are responsible for foraging, nest maintenance, and defense of the colony. These ants are primarily omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant and animal matter, including honeydew produced by aphids and other sap-feeding insects.\n\nCamponotus vicinus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, serving as a food source for various predators and contributing to the decomposition of dead wood through their nesting activities. However, when their colonies invade human structures, they can cause significant damage to wooden elements, making them a potential pest species in some regions.",
