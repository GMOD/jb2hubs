  "description": "Heliocidaris erythrogramma, commonly known as the Southern Sea Urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in the coastal waters of southern Australia and Tasmania. It is a member of the family Echinometridae, a group of echinoids characterized by their oval-shaped test (shell) and relatively long spines.\n\nThe test of H. erythrogramma is typically dark reddish-brown or purple in color, with distinctive red-colored lines or bands radiating from the anus. The spines are relatively long, slender, and can range in color from reddish-brown to purple. This species is a herbivore, feeding primarily on macroalgae and seagrasses found in its coastal habitat.\n\nH. erythrogramma plays an important role in the benthic ecosystems of southern Australia, serving as a key grazer and contributing to the structuring of algal and seagrass communities. It is also a valuable resource for commercial and recreational fisheries in the region.",
