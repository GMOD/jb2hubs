  "description": "Cyanocitta stelleri, commonly known as the Steller's jay, is a species of jay native to western North America. It is a member of the family Corvidae, which includes other corvid birds such as crows, ravens, and magpies.\n\nThe Steller's jay is a medium-sized bird, measuring approximately 30 to 34 centimeters (12 to 13.5 inches) in length. It has a distinctive blue and black plumage, with a prominent crest on its head. The bird's blue coloration is produced by the structural properties of its feathers, which scatter light and create the vivid blue hue.\n\nSteller's jays are known for their intelligence, adaptability, and omnivorous diet. They primarily feed on a variety of food sources, including insects, seeds, nuts, fruits, and even small vertebrates. These birds are also known to be opportunistic and will readily take advantage of human-provided food sources, such as bird feeders.\n\nThe Steller's jay is an important part of the ecosystem in its native range, serving as a seed disperser and playing a role in the regeneration of certain plant species. Additionally, their loud, harsh calls and bold behavior make them a familiar and often-observed bird in many western North American communities.",
