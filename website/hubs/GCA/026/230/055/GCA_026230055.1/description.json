  "description": "Corynorhinus townsendii, commonly known as Townsend's big-eared bat, is a species of bat native to western North America. It belongs to the family Vespertilionidae, which includes many of the common bats found in the region.\n\nKey features of Corynorhinus townsendii:\n\n1. Appearance: It has large, prominent ears that are about the length of its body. The ears are pinkish-brown in color and have a distinctive \"keel\" or ridge along the back of each ear. The fur is grayish-brown in color.\n\n2. Size: Townsend's big-eared bat is a medium-sized bat, with a total body length of around 11-14 cm (4.3-5.5 inches) and a wingspan of 30-35 cm (11.8-13.8 inches).\n\n3. Habitat and Distribution: This species is found in a variety of habitats, including caves, abandoned buildings, mines, and other sheltered areas. Its range extends from British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, through the western United States, and into parts of Mexico.\n\n4. Diet and Foraging: Corynorhinus townsendii is an insectivorous bat, feeding primarily on moths, flies, and other small insects. It uses its large ears to detect the sounds of its prey and then captures them in flight.\n\n5. Reproduction and Lifespan: Townsend's big-eared bats typically give birth to a single offspring each year. They can live for up to 16 years in the wild, making them one of the longer-lived bat species in North America.\n\nThis species is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health due to its specific habitat requirements and susceptibility to disturbance. Conservation efforts focus on protecting the caves, mines, and other roosting sites used by these bats.",
