  "description": "Pleurodeles waltl, commonly known as the Spanish ribbed newt or Walter's newt, is a species of newt native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Salamandridae and is a member of the genus Pleurodeles.\n\nThe Spanish ribbed newt is a medium-sized amphibian, typically reaching a length of around 15-20 cm. It has a robust, stocky build and a broad, flattened head. The skin of Pleurodeles waltl is rough and granular, with conspicuous rib-like protrusions along the sides of its body, which are the result of the ribs pushing through the skin. This unique feature gives the species its common name.\n\nPleurodeles waltl is a semi-aquatic species, spending part of its life cycle in water and part on land. It inhabits a variety of aquatic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, as well as damp, terrestrial environments like forests and grasslands.\n\nThe species is known for its regenerative abilities, being able to regrow lost limbs, tails, and even parts of its internal organs. This remarkable adaptation allows Pleuroderes waltl to survive predator attacks and recover from injuries.\n\nPleuroderes waltl plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a predator of small invertebrates and a prey item for larger predators. It is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but its populations may be threatened by habitat loss and degradation in some parts of its range.",
