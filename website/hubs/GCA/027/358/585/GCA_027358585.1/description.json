  "description": "Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, commonly known as the iridescent shark or striped catfish, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Pangasiidae. It is native to the Mekong and Chao Phraya river basins in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.\n\nThe iridescent shark is a large, elongated catfish with a distinctive silvery-grey coloration and dark vertical stripes along its body. It can grow up to 130 cm in length and can weigh up to 44 kg, making it one of the largest freshwater catfish species. The species is characterized by its small, downward-facing eyes, which are the origin of its scientific name \"hypophthalmus,\" meaning \"under-eyed.\"\n\nPangasianodon hypophthalmus is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, small invertebrates, and even fish. It is an important commercial and aquaculture species, being widely farmed for its edible flesh and high market demand. However, the species is also threatened by overfishing, habitat degradation, and pollution in its native range, leading to its classification as \"Vulnerable\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
