  "description": "Cynocephalus volans, commonly known as the Philippine flying lemur or the Malayan flying lemur, is a species of gliding mammal native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the order Dermoptera, which is the only order of gliding mammals.\n\nThe Philippine flying lemur is a medium-sized arboreal mammal, with a body length of around 35-40 cm and a weight of 1-2 kg. It has a distinctive patagium, a membrane of skin that extends from its neck to its limbs, allowing it to glide between trees. This patagium is supported by an elongated wrist bone, enabling the animal to spread its limbs and glide for distances of up to 100 meters.\n\nThe species has large, round eyes, which are adapted for nocturnal and crepuscular activity. It has a long, pointed snout and a well-developed sense of smell, which it uses to locate its primary food source, which consists of leaves, fruits, and flowers.\n\nCynocephalus volans is primarily found in the tropical forests of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is a solitary and arboreal species, spending most of its time in the upper canopy of the forest. The species is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, but it faces threats from habitat loss and hunting in some regions.",
