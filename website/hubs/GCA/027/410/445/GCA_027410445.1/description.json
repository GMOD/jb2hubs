  "description": "Discoglossus pictus, commonly known as the painted frog or Iberian painted frog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Alytidae. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula, including parts of Spain and Portugal, and some Mediterranean islands.\n\nThe painted frog is a small to medium-sized amphibian, typically reaching lengths of 4-7 cm. It has a distinctive appearance, with a flattened body and a wide, triangular head. The skin is smooth and can vary in color from shades of brown, gray, or olive, often with darker mottled patterns or spots. The ventral side is typically lighter in color, sometimes with a yellowish or reddish hue.\n\nDiscoglossus pictus is a terrestrial and semi-aquatic species, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including forests, scrublands, and temporary water bodies such as ponds and streams. It is primarily nocturnal and is known for its ability to camouflage itself effectively in its natural environment.\n\nThe painted frog reproduces through external fertilization, with the females laying clusters of eggs in water. The tadpoles undergo metamorphosis, transforming into juvenile frogs that then become sexually mature.\n\nDiscoglossus pictus is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is generally widespread throughout its range. However, it may face local threats due to habitat loss and degradation.",
