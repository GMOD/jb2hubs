  "description": "Acridotheres tristis, commonly known as the common myna or Indian myna, is a species of starling native to Asia. It is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring around 23-25 cm in length, with a robust, conical bill and a distinctive yellow patch around the eyes.\n\nThe common myna is known for its adaptability and has successfully colonized various habitats, including urban areas, agricultural lands, and even forests. Its diet is omnivorous, consisting of insects, fruits, seeds, and even small vertebrates. The species is known for its vocal abilities, with a repertoire that includes a variety of calls, whistles, and mimicry.\n\nAcridotheres tristis is considered an invasive species in several regions, where it has outcompeted native bird species and impacted local ecosystems. Its success as an invasive species is largely attributed to its adaptability, opportunistic feeding behavior, and aggressive territorial defense.\n\nThe common myna is a relatively common and widespread species, and its population is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the species is also known to have some negative impacts on local ecosystems, and its management may be necessary in certain areas where it is considered a pest.",
