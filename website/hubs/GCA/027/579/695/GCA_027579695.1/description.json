  "description": "Neoarius graeffei, also known as the Graeffes' catfish or Graeffes' sea catfish, is a species of freshwater catfish belonging to the genus Neoarius. It is native to coastal rivers and estuaries in northern Australia, from the Kimberley region of Western Australia to northern Queensland.\n\nNeoarius graeffei is a medium-sized catfish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 50 cm. It has a robust, elongated body with a large, flattened head and a terminal mouth. The fish has four pairs of whisker-like barbels around the mouth, which it uses to locate food in its murky, benthic habitat. The dorsal and pectoral fins each have a strong, serrated spine, which can be used for defense.\n\nThis species is an omnivorous feeder, consuming a variety of prey such as small fish, crustaceans, and plant material. Neoarius graeffei plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, serving as both a predator and a food source for larger predatory species.\n\nConservation-wise, Neoarius graeffei is classified as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN, as it has a wide distribution and is not currently facing significant threats to its populations.",
