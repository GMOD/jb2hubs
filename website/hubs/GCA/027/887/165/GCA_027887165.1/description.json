  "description": "Monodelphis domestica, commonly known as the gray short-tailed opossum, is a small marsupial species native to eastern Brazil, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina. It belongs to the order Didelphimorphia, which includes opossums and related species.\n\nThe gray short-tailed opossum is a nocturnal and arboreal mammal, typically weighing between 70-120 grams. It has a grayish-brown fur coat, a pointed snout, and a short, non-prehensile tail. Unlike many other opossums, the gray short-tailed opossum does not have a pouch (marsupium) to carry its young.\n\nMonodelphis domestica is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, fruits, and occasionally small vertebrates. It is known for its fast metabolism and high body temperature, adaptations that help it thrive in its tropical and subtropical habitats.\n\nThis species is widely used in scientific research, particularly in the fields of developmental biology, genetics, and neuroscience, due to its small size, short gestation period, and well-documented genome. Monodelphis domestica has become an important model organism for studying various biological processes and diseases.",
