  "description": "Lycodopsis pacificus is a species of eelpout, a type of marine fish belonging to the family Zoarcidae. It is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal waters from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nThe Lycodopsis pacificus is a small, elongated fish with a rounded, eel-like body. It typically measures between 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The fish has a large, terminal mouth with small teeth, and a single, long dorsal fin that runs along the length of its body. Its coloration is generally brown or grayish, sometimes with darker mottling or spots.\n\nThis eelpout species is known to inhabit a variety of benthic habitats, including rocky, sandy, or muddy seafloors, often at depths ranging from 20 to 600 meters. Lycodopsis pacificus is considered a bottom-dwelling, predatory fish, feeding primarily on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other small invertebrates found in its coastal and continental shelf environments.\n\nReproduction in Lycodopsis pacificus involves internal fertilization, with the females giving birth to live young. The species is believed to have a relatively long lifespan compared to other small eelpout species found in the region.",
