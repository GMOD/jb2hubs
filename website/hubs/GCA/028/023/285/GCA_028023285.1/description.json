  "description": "Balaenoptera ricei, commonly known as Rice's whale, is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family Balaenopteridae. It is a member of the rorqual group, which includes the blue whale, fin whale, and humpback whale, among others.\n\nRice's whale is a relatively recently discovered species, having been recognized as distinct from the closely related Bryde's whale in 2021. It is characterized by its medium-sized body, with a length typically ranging from 12 to 15 meters (39 to 49 feet). The species is known to have a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body and a distinctive three-ridge pattern on the top of its head, which helps differentiate it from other similar rorqual species.\n\nGenetic and morphological analyses have shown that Rice's whale is a distinct species, with a unique evolutionary history and geographic distribution. The species is found in the northern Gulf of Mexico, primarily in the waters off the coast of the United States.\n\nRice's whale feeds primarily on small schooling fish, such as sardines and anchovies, as well as krill and other small crustaceans. The species is believed to be a baleen whale, using its specialized filter-feeding apparatus to strain prey from the water.\n\nThe conservation status of Rice's whale is currently under evaluation, as more research is needed to better understand its population size, threats, and overall ecological role in the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem.",
