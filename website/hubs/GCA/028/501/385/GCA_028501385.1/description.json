  "description": "Rissa tridactyla, commonly known as the black-legged kittiwake, is a seabird species belonging to the gull family, Laridae. It is a medium-sized gull with a distinctive black-tipped yellow bill, a white head, body, and underparts, and dark gray wings with black wing tips.\n\nThe black-legged kittiwake is a highly migratory species, breeding in colonies on cliffs and rocky coastlines in the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas. During the non-breeding season, they can be found in more temperate and subtropical coastal regions.\n\nThese birds are highly adapted to a marine environment, with their streamlined bodies and long, slender wings enabling them to soar and dive efficiently for their prey, which consists primarily of small fish, crustaceans, and other marine invertebrates. They are also known for their distinctive, high-pitched \"kittee-waa\" call.\n\nThe black-legged kittiwake is considered a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but their populations have been declining in certain regions due to factors such as climate change, overfishing, and oil spills, which can negatively impact their breeding success and food availability.",
