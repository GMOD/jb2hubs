  "description": "Varecia variegata, commonly known as the ruffed lemur, is a species of lemur native to the island of Madagascar. It is a medium-sized primate, weighing between 3 to 4.5 kilograms, with a distinctive black and white or reddish-orange and black fur coloration.\n\nRuffed lemurs are arboreal and diurnal, spending most of their time in the canopy of the tropical rainforests. They are characterized by their long, bushy tails and a ruff of fur around their faces, which gives them a unique appearance.\n\nThese lemurs are highly social and live in small groups, often with a dominant female leading the group. They are primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, flowers, and leaves, and play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers.\n\nRuffed lemurs are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic species and its rainforest habitat in Madagascar.",
