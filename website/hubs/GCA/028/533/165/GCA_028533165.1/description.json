  "description": "Leontopithecus rosalia, commonly known as the golden lion tamarin, is a small primate species native to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. It is a member of the family Callitrichidae, which includes marmosets and tamarins.\n\nThe golden lion tamarin is characterized by its distinctive golden-orange fur, which covers its entire body, including its face and tail. This vibrant coloration is believed to serve as a form of camouflage in the dense, humid forests it inhabits. The species is named for its resemblance to a small lion, with a mane-like ruff of fur around its face.\n\nGolden lion tamarins are arboreal and social, living in small family groups of 2 to 8 individuals. They are primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, insects, and small vertebrates. Their agile and acrobatic movements allow them to navigate the complex forest canopy with ease.\n\nConservation status: The golden lion tamarin is classified as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss and fragmentation within its limited geographic range. Extensive efforts have been made to protect and restore the species' population through captive breeding and reintroduction programs.",
