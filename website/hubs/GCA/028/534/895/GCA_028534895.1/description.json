  "description": "Populus trichocarpa, commonly known as the black cottonwood or western balsam poplar, is a large deciduous tree species native to western North America. It is a member of the willow family (Salicaceae) and is one of the largest and fastest-growing tree species in the region.\n\nThe black cottonwood can reach heights of up to 60 meters (200 feet) and have a trunk diameter of up to 2 meters (6.5 feet). The bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming deeply furrowed and dark gray or black with age. The leaves are alternate, broadly ovate, and have a distinct triangular shape with a pointed tip. They are dark green on the upper surface and paler on the lower surface, and turn golden yellow in the fall before shedding.\n\nThe species is known for its prolific production of small, fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This trait gives the tree its common name of \"cottonwood.\" The tree is an important resource for wildlife, providing food and habitat for various birds, mammals, and insects.\n\nPopulus trichocarpa is also valued for its wood, which is used in the production of various products, including lumber, pulp, and biomass for energy. Additionally, the tree has been the subject of extensive genetic research due to its status as the first tree genome to be sequenced, providing insights into the evolution and biology of trees.",
