  "description": "Umbellularia californica, commonly known as the California bay laurel or simply the California bay, is an evergreen tree species native to the coastal regions of California and southwestern Oregon. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other well-known aromatic plants such as the true laurel (Laurus nobilis) and avocado (Persea americana).\n\nThe California bay laurel is a large, slow-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters (100 feet) and has a characteristic pyramidal or rounded crown. Its leaves are elliptical to lanceolate in shape, glossy green, and highly aromatic when crushed, emitting a distinctive camphor-like scent. The small, yellow-green flowers are produced in clusters, followed by dark blue or purple drupes (single-seeded fruits) that are favored by various wildlife species.\n\nThe wood of the California bay laurel is valued for its hardness and use in furniture and cabinetry. Additionally, the leaves and fruits have been traditionally used by Native American communities for their culinary and medicinal properties. This species plays an important ecological role in the coastal forests and woodlands it inhabits, serving as a food source and habitat for numerous birds, mammals, and invertebrates.",
