  "description": "Eubalaena glacialis, commonly known as the North Atlantic right whale, is a species of large baleen whale found in the western North Atlantic Ocean. It is one of the most endangered large whale species in the world, with a global population estimated to be around 400 individuals.\n\nThe North Atlantic right whale is a member of the family Balaenidae, which includes the three recognized species of right whales. These whales are characterized by their lack of a dorsal fin, the presence of callosities (rough patches of skin) on their heads, and their broad, rounded bodies.\n\nEubalaena glacialis can grow up to 15 meters in length and can weigh up to 100 metric tons. These whales are slow-moving, often observed at the surface of the water, and are known to feed primarily on small, planktonic crustaceans such as copepods and krill.\n\nThe primary threats to the North Atlantic right whale include entanglement in fishing gear, vessel strikes, and habitat degradation. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this critically endangered species and support its recovery.",
