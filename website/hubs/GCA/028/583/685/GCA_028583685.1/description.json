  "description": "Petaurus breviceps papuanus is a subspecies of the sugar glider, a small gliding marsupial found in parts of Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. This subspecies is specifically found in the island of New Guinea.\n\nThe Petaurus breviceps papuanus is a small, nocturnal mammal with a body length of around 16-20 cm and a weight of 90-150 grams. It has a fur coat that is typically grey or brown in color, with a white underbelly. The species has a distinctive gliding membrane, known as the patagium, which extends from the wrists to the ankles, allowing it to glide between trees.\n\nLike other sugar gliders, the Petaurus breviceps papuanus is an arboreal species, living and foraging primarily in the tree canopy. It is an omnivorous feeder, consuming a variety of insects, small vertebrates, and plant matter, including nectar and sap.\n\nThe species is known to be social, living in small family groups and communicating through a range of vocalizations, including barks, chirps, and hisses. The Petaurus breviceps papuanus is an important part of the ecosystem in its native range, contributing to the dispersal of seeds and the regulation of insect populations.",
