It is a medium-sized primate belonging to the genus Cercopithecus, which includes various species of guenons.\n\nThe blue monkey has a distinctive blue-gray coloration on its back and limbs, with a paler underside. Its face is characterized by a prominent brow ridge and a black nose and lips. The species is arboreal, spending most of its time in the trees, and is known for its agile and acrobatic movements.\n\nBlue monkeys are social animals, living in multi-male, multi-female troops that can range in size from a few individuals to over 50 members. They are primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, flowers, and insects. The species plays an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers and as a food source for larger predators.\n\nCercopithecus mitis is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although some populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species and its natural habitat.",
