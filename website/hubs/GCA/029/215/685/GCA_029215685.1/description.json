  "description": "Pituophis catenifer annectens, commonly known as the San Diego gopher snake, is a subspecies of the gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer) found in the southwestern United States. This snake is a non-venomous, constrictor species that is known for its ability to mimic the rattle of a rattlesnake when threatened.\n\nThe San Diego gopher snake is characterized by its slender, cylindrical body and a distinctive pattern of blotches or saddles along its length. The blotches are typically dark brown or black in color, with the spaces between them being a lighter brown or tan. The snake's head is relatively small compared to its body, and it has a pointed snout.\n\nThis subspecies is typically found in a variety of habitats, including chaparral, grasslands, and open woodlands, often in areas with suitable cover, such as rocks, logs, or burrows. They are known to be excellent climbers and can often be found in trees or on fences.\n\nPituophis catenifer annectens is an important part of the local ecosystem, serving as both a predator and a prey species. They play a role in controlling populations of small rodents, such as gophers and ground squirrels, while also being a food source for larger predators, such as coyotes and birds of prey.",
