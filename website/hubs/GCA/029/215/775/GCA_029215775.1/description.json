  "description": "Anniella stebbinsi, commonly known as Stebbins' legless lizard, is a species of legless lizard native to California, United States. It belongs to the family Anniellidae, which are small, burrowing lizards found exclusively in the western regions of North America.\n\nAnniella stebbinsi is a small, elongated reptile that lacks visible external limbs, giving it a snake-like appearance. Its body is typically covered in smooth, shiny scales that can range in color from light brown to dark gray, with occasional darker spots or blotches. The species can be distinguished from other legless lizard species by its larger size, more rounded snout, and the presence of a distinct dark line running along the sides of its body.\n\nThese legless lizards are found in a variety of habitats, including coastal scrub, chaparral, and oak woodland areas. They primarily feed on small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders, and use their burrowing abilities to hide from predators and seek shelter. Anniella stebbinsi is considered a sensitive species due to its limited range and habitat requirements, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique reptile.",
