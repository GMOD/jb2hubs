  "description": "Hyla sarda, also known as the Sardinian tree frog, is a species of tree frog found in the Mediterranean region, primarily on the island of Sardinia and in parts of Italy. This small amphibian belongs to the family Hylidae, which includes various tree frog species known for their ability to climb and perch on vegetation.\n\nThe Sardinian tree frog is typically green in coloration, with a slender body and long, slender limbs adapted for arboreal living. Its toes are equipped with adhesive pads, allowing it to climb and cling to surfaces with ease. The species is nocturnal and primarily inhabits deciduous and evergreen forests, as well as shrublands and urban areas with suitable vegetation.\n\nHyla sarda is an important part of the local ecosystem, serving as a predator of various invertebrates and playing a role in the food web. The species reproduces through the laying of eggs in temporary water bodies, such as ponds or pools, where the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs.\n\nDue to its relatively limited distribution and potential threats from habitat loss and degradation, the Sardinian tree frog is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but its population status and conservation needs are ongoing areas of research and monitoring.",
