  "description": "Hoplias malabaricus, commonly known as the trahira or wolf fish, is a freshwater fish species that belongs to the Erythrinidae family. It is native to South and Central America, found in various river systems and water bodies throughout the region.\n\nThe trahira is a predatory fish known for its elongated, cylindrical body and large, beak-like jaws with sharp teeth. It is typically olive-green or brown in color with darker blotches or patterns along its sides. The species can grow up to 60 cm in length and is an important food and sport fish in its native range.\n\nHoplias malabaricus is a voracious predator, feeding on a variety of smaller fish, crustaceans, and even small mammals or birds that come within its reach. It is an ambush predator, often lying in wait for its prey before striking quickly to capture it.\n\nThe species is known for its ability to survive in low-oxygen environments, including stagnant or deoxygenated water bodies, due to its accessory respiratory organs. This adaptation allows the trahira to gulp air from the surface, supplementing its gill-based respiration.\n\nHoplias malabaricus plays a significant ecological role in its native habitats, serving as both a predator and a prey species within the aquatic food web. It is also of economic importance as a valued food fish and is sometimes kept in aquariums for its unique appearance and behaviors.",
