  "description": "Lampris incognitus, commonly known as the incognito opah or mystery opah, is a rare and elusive species of marine fish belonging to the family Lampridae. This species was first described in 2009 based on a single specimen collected from the waters off the coast of Baja California, Mexico.\n\nThe Lampris incognitus is a deep-bodied, disk-shaped fish with a distinctive silvery-gray coloration and large, rounded fins. One of the most notable features of this species is its apparent ability to change color, which is thought to be a form of camouflage or communication. Unlike other members of the Lampridae family, the incognito opah has a more elongated and streamlined body shape, which may be an adaptation to its deep-water habitat.\n\nVery little is known about the biology and ecology of this species, as it has been rarely observed and studied. It is believed to be a predatory fish that feeds on a variety of smaller marine organisms, such as smaller fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. The incognito opah is thought to inhabit the mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones of the ocean, where it may play an important role in the deeper marine food web.\n\nDue to the limited information available, the conservation status of the Lampris incognitus is currently classified as \"Data Deficient\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Further research is needed to better understand the distribution, population size, and potential threats to this enigmatic species.",
