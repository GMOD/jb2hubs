  "description": "Trichomycterus rosablanca is a species of freshwater catfish belonging to the family Trichomycteridae, also known as the pencil or parasitic catfishes. It is native to Colombia, where it is found in the Riosucio and Blanco River basins.\n\nT. rosablanca is a small-sized catfish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 8 centimeters (3.1 inches). It has a slender, elongated body shape and a flattened head. The fish possesses a single pair of barbels around the mouth, which are used for sensory and feeding purposes.\n\nThe species is known to inhabit clear, well-oxygenated streams and rivers with rocky or gravel substrates. It is believed to feed on a variety of small invertebrates and organic matter found in its aquatic environment.\n\nLimited information is available on the specific reproductive biology and life cycle of T. rosablanca. However, like other members of the Trichomycteridae family, it is likely to exhibit adaptations for survival in its lotic (flowing water) habitat.\n\nConservation status and threats to the species are not well-documented, but it is important to consider the potential impacts of habitat degradation, water pollution, and other anthropogenic factors that may affect the local populations of T. rosablanca in its native range.",
