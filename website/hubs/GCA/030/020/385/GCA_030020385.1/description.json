  "description": "Gavialis gangeticus, commonly known as the Indian gharial or the Ganges gharial, is a critically endangered crocodilian species found in the rivers of northern India and Nepal. It is the only surviving member of the Gavialidae family, which is known to have existed for over 200 million years.\n\nThe Indian gharial is characterized by its long, slender snout, which is adapted for catching and feeding on fish, its primary prey. The snout can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, accounting for nearly half of the animal's total body length. Their jaws are lined with numerous sharp, interlocking teeth, which are perfect for grasping and holding onto slippery fish.\n\nThese reptiles are primarily aquatic and rely on the river systems of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for their survival. They are excellent swimmers and can dive and remain submerged for extended periods. Gharials are known to bask on the riverbanks, sometimes forming large congregations, which helps them regulate their body temperature.\n\nDue to various threats, such as habitat loss, poaching, and fishing activities, the Indian gharial has experienced a significant population decline over the past few decades. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs and habitat restoration, are ongoing to prevent the extinction of this unique and ancient crocodilian species.",
