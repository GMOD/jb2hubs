  "description": "Mobula birostris, commonly known as the giant manta ray, is a species of large ray belonging to the family Mobulidae. It is the largest known species of ray, with a wingspan that can reach up to 7 meters (23 feet) in width.\n\nThe giant manta ray is a pelagic species, meaning it inhabits the open ocean and does not typically reside in coastal areas. It has a distinctive diamond-shaped body with large, wing-like pectoral fins that enable it to perform graceful, acrobatic maneuvers in the water.\n\nThese rays are filter feeders, primarily consuming small planktonic organisms such as krill, copepods, and small fish. They use their large, gaping mouths to take in a large volume of water, which is then filtered through their gill rakers, allowing them to capture their prey.\n\nMobula birostris is a long-lived species, with a lifespan that can reach up to 40 years. They are migratory, often traveling long distances in search of food and favorable environmental conditions. The species is considered vulnerable to extinction due to various threats, including bycatch in commercial fisheries, habitat degradation, and targeted hunting for their gill plates, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nConservation efforts, such as the establishment of protected areas and regulations on fishing, are crucial for the preservation of this remarkable species and the maintenance of healthy ocean ecosystems.",
