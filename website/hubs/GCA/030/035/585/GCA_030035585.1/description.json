  "description": "The Dugong (Dugong dugon) is a large marine mammal species that belongs to the order Sirenia, which also includes manatees. Dugongs are herbivorous, aquatic creatures that inhabit the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the east coast of Africa to the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nPhysically, dugongs are characterized by a distinctive fusiform (torpedo-shaped) body, with a broad, paddle-like tail and small, paddle-like flippers. They have a rounded, blunt snout and lack the distinct rostrum (nose) found in manatees. Dugongs are typically gray or brown in color and can grow up to 3 meters in length and weigh up to 400 kilograms.\n\nDugongs are adapted to their marine environment, with their front limbs modified into flippers and their hind limbs reduced to small, internal bones. They are excellent swimmers, using their powerful tails to propel themselves through the water. Dugongs are known to be slow-moving and docile creatures, primarily feeding on seagrasses that grow in shallow, coastal habitats.\n\nAs a member of the Sirenia order, dugongs are closely related to manatees and share many similar characteristics, such as their herbivorous diet and their need to surface regularly to breathe. However, dugongs are distinct from manatees in their geographic distribution, morphology, and some behavioral traits.\n\nDugongs are classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to various threats, including habitat loss, hunting, and the entanglement in fishing gear. Conservation efforts to protect dugongs and their habitats are essential for the survival of this unique marine mammal.",
