  "description": "Hypanus sabinus, commonly known as the Atlantic stingray, is a species of stingray belonging to the family Dasyatidae. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, inhabiting coastal waters from New Jersey to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe Atlantic stingray is a benthic species, meaning it primarily lives and feeds on the seafloor. It has a flattened, diamond-shaped disc with a long, whip-like tail. The upper surface of the disc is typically brown or olive-green in color, while the underside is white. The tail features a venomous spine used for defense, which can deliver a painful sting.\n\nThese stingrays feed on a variety of small benthic organisms, such as crustaceans, mollusks, and small bony fishes. They use their wing-like pectoral fins to dig and uncover their prey from the seafloor. The Atlantic stingray is ovoviviparous, meaning the embryos develop inside the mother's body and are born as fully-formed juveniles.\n\nDue to its relatively small size and coastal distribution, the Atlantic stingray is not considered a major threat to humans, although caution should be exercised when handling or approaching these animals in their natural habitat.",
