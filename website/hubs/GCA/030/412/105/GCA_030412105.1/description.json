  "description": "Cyclura pinguis, commonly known as the Anegada iguana or Puerto Rican iguana, is a species of large, herbivorous lizard endemic to the Caribbean island of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. This iguana is characterized by its robust, stocky build, with a rounded head, short snout, and strong claws adapted for climbing and digging.\n\nThe Cyclura pinguis is a medium-sized iguana, typically reaching lengths of around 1.2 meters (4 feet) from head to tail. Its coloration is predominantly greenish-gray, with occasional darker banding or spotting patterns on the body and tail. These iguanas are known for their distinctive \"horns\" or bony projections on their head, which likely serve as a defense mechanism and for social signaling.\n\nCyclura pinguis is an arboreal and terrestrial species, spending time both in the trees and on the ground. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of native plants, including cacti, flowers, and leaves. These iguanas play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as seed dispersers and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the island.\n\nThe Anegada iguana is considered a critically endangered species due to habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and historical overhunting. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting the remaining population and its fragile island ecosystem.",
