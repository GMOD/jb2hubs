  "description": "Mustela lutreola, commonly known as the European mink, is a small semi-aquatic carnivorous mammal species that belongs to the Mustelidae family. It is native to parts of Europe, including eastern and central Europe, as well as parts of western Europe.\n\nThe European mink is a slender and streamlined animal, with a long, cylindrical body, short legs, and a bushy tail. Its fur is typically dark brown or black in color, providing camouflage in its natural aquatic habitats. These minks are excellent swimmers and divers, with webbed feet and a strong, muscular tail that aids in their aquatic locomotion.\n\nThe European mink is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of small animals, including fish, amphibians, small mammals, and birds. They are known to be adept at hunting in both aquatic and terrestrial environments.\n\nDue to habitat loss, hunting, and competition with the invasive American mink, the European mink is considered an endangered species, with a declining population across its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important species.",
