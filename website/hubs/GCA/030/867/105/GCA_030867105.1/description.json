  "description": "Liasis olivaceus, commonly known as the olive python, is a species of non-venomous snake found in northern Australia. It belongs to the family Pythonidae, which includes several species of large, heavy-bodied snakes.\n\nThe olive python is a large snake, with adult individuals typically reaching lengths between 2 to 4 meters (6.6 to 13.1 feet). Its body is stout and muscular, with a broad head and relatively small eyes. The coloration of the olive python is primarily olive-green or brown, with darker banding or blotches along the body, providing excellent camouflage in its natural habitat.\n\nThese snakes are primarily arboreal, spending much of their time in trees and shrubs, although they can also be found on the ground. They are excellent climbers and often use their prehensile tails to assist in climbing and moving through the vegetation. The olive python's diet consists mainly of small to medium-sized mammals, birds, and other reptiles, which it ambushes and constricts before swallowing whole.\n\nLiasis olivaceus is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and parts of Queensland. They prefer habitats with dense vegetation, such as rainforests, swamps, and riverine forests, where they can effectively hunt and find suitable shelter.",
