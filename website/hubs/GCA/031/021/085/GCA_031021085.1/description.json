  "description": "Erythrolamprus reginae, commonly known as the coral snake, is a species of venomous snake belonging to the genus Erythrolamprus. It is native to parts of Central and South America, including Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil.\n\nThe coral snake is characterized by its striking red, yellow, and black banded pattern, which is a classic example of Batesian mimicry, as it resembles the highly venomous coral snakes of the genus Micrurus. This coloration serves as a warning to predators about the snake's potent neurotoxic venom.\n\nErythrolamprus reginae is a relatively small snake, typically reaching lengths of 60-90 cm. It has a slender body and a small, rounded head. The snake's diet consists primarily of small rodents, lizards, and other small vertebrates.\n\nCoral snakes are often considered reclusive and shy, preferring to avoid confrontation with humans. However, their venom can be deadly if untreated, making them an important species to recognize and respect in their natural habitats.",
