  "description": "The Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Angola2005 is a highly virulent strain of the Marburgvirus genus, which belongs to the Filoviridae family. This virus was responsible for an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Angola in 2005.\n\nThe Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Angola2005 strain is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus, characterized by its filamentous or pleomorphic morphology. It is primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats, which are the natural reservoir of the virus.\n\nThe infection caused by this virus can lead to a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. The case fatality rate for the 2005 Angola outbreak was approximately 90%, making it one of the deadliest Marburg virus outbreaks on record.\n\nThe Lake Victoria marburgvirus - Angola2005 strain is considered a significant public health concern due to its high virulence and the potential for rapid spread in human populations. Ongoing research and surveillance efforts are crucial for understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential interventions for this dangerous viral pathogen.",
