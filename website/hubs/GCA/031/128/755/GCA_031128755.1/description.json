  "description": "Human enterovirus 71 HZ08/Hangzhou/2008 is a strain of the enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus, which belongs to the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae family. EV71 is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and, in rare cases, life-threatening complications.\n\nThe HZ08/Hangzhou/2008 strain was isolated from a patient in Hangzhou, China, in 2008. Genetic analysis has shown that this strain belongs to the C4 subgenotype of EV71, which has been responsible for numerous outbreaks of HFMD in the Asia-Pacific region in recent decades. The HZ08/Hangzhou/2008 strain shares a high degree of genetic similarity with other C4 subgenotype strains, indicating that it is part of the ongoing evolution and adaptation of EV71 within the human population.\n\nContinued surveillance and research on EV71 strains like HZ08/Hangzhou/2008 are important for understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health implications of this significant human pathogen.",
