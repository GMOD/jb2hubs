  "description": "Morus bassanus, commonly known as the Northern Gannet or Solan Goose, is a large seabird species belonging to the family Sulidae. It is one of the largest members of the gannet family, with a wingspan reaching up to 2 meters (6.6 feet).\n\nThe Northern Gannet is primarily white in color, with black-tipped wings and a distinctive yellow head and neck. It has a long, slender, and sharply pointed bill, which it uses to catch fish by plunge-diving into the water from heights of up to 30 meters (100 feet).\n\nThese birds are found in the North Atlantic Ocean, breeding in large colonies on rocky cliffs and islands. They are excellent flyers and divers, using their keen eyesight to locate and pursue their prey, which consists mainly of various species of fish and squid.\n\nNorthern Gannets are known for their impressive breeding behavior, which includes elaborate courtship displays and the construction of nests made of seaweed, grass, and other plant materials. They are long-lived birds, with some individuals reaching over 30 years of age.\n\nThe Northern Gannet is a species of conservation concern due to various threats, including overfishing, oil spills, and habitat degradation. However, their populations are generally stable, and they are classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
