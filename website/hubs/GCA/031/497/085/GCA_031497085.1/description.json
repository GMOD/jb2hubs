  "description": "Toscana virus (TOSV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Phlebovirus, genus Phlebovirus, within the order Bunyavirales. It is primarily transmitted by the sand fly Phlebotomus perniciosus and is found in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and parts of France.\n\nTOSV is known to cause a type of acute febrile illness in humans, often referred to as Toscana virus infection or Toscana virus disease. The clinical manifestations can range from mild, influenza-like symptoms to more severe neurological complications, such as meningitis or meningoencephalitis.\n\nThe virus is believed to have a zoonotic reservoir, with small mammals, such as rodents, serving as potential reservoirs. Humans can become infected through the bite of infected sand flies or by handling infected animals.\n\nToscana virus is an emerging pathogen, and its epidemiology and public health significance are still being actively investigated. Ongoing research aims to better understand the virus's biology, transmission dynamics, and the development of effective diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic interventions.",
