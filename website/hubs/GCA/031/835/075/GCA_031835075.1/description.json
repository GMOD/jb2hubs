  "description": "Saguarus oedipus, commonly known as the cotton-top tamarin, is a small New World primate species that belongs to the family Callitrichidae. This arboreal species is native to the northwestern regions of Colombia, primarily found in tropical humid forests and dry deciduous forests.\n\nThe cotton-top tamarin is characterized by its distinctive white crest of long, silky hair that extends from the forehead to the shoulders, which is the source of its common name. The rest of its body is covered in black or dark brown fur. These primates are small, weighing between 400 to 500 grams, and measure around 20-25 cm in length.\n\nSaguarus oedipus is a highly social species, living in tight-knit family groups of 2 to 9 individuals. They are known for their complex cooperative breeding system, where the entire group participates in the care and rearing of the young. These tamarins are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, small vertebrates, fruits, and exudates.\n\nThe cotton-top tamarin is considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for the pet trade. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs and habitat protection, are ongoing to ensure the survival of this unique primate species.",
