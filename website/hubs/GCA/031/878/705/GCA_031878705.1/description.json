  "description": "Tapirus indicus, commonly known as the Malayan tapir, is a species of tapir native to the Malay Peninsula and the island of Sumatra in Southeast Asia. It is the largest of the four extant tapir species and is characterized by its distinctive black and white coloration, which provides camouflage in its natural habitat.\n\nThe Malayan tapir is a herbivorous mammal that primarily feeds on a variety of plants, including leaves, fruits, and aquatic vegetation. It is a solitary and nocturnal animal, spending much of its time wallowing in shallow rivers and streams to keep cool and avoid predators.\n\nThe Malayan tapir is an important ecological component of its native ecosystem, serving as a seed disperser and playing a role in the maintenance of forest diversity. However, it is classified as an Endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, hunting, and other human-related threats.\n\nConservation efforts are ongoing to protect the Malayan tapir and its habitat, including the establishment of protected areas and the implementation of anti-poaching measures. Understanding the biology and ecology of this unique species is crucial for its long-term survival and the preservation of the diverse ecosystems in which it resides.",
