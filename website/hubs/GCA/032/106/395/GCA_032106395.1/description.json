  "description": "Camel Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus is a member of the Orthonairovirus genus within the Nairoviridae family. It is the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a severe and potentially fatal viral disease in humans.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, particularly those belonging to the Hyalomma genus. It can also be transmitted through contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected animals, such as livestock, especially camels.\n\nThe Camel Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a tripartite genome. The virus targets and replicates within various cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and cells of the immune system, leading to the characteristic hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease.\n\nCCHF is a significant public health concern, particularly in regions where the virus is endemic, such as parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. The disease can cause severe illness, with a high case-fatality rate, and effective treatment options are limited. Preventive measures, such as tick control and personal protective equipment, are crucial in reducing the risk of infection.",
