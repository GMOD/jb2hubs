  "description": "Populus alba x Populus glandulosa is a naturally occurring hybrid between the white poplar (Populus alba) and the glandular poplar (Populus glandulosa). This hybrid is known as the silver poplar or the hybrid poplar.\n\nThe silver poplar is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall. It has a broad, rounded crown and a straight, cylindrical trunk. The leaves are lobed and have a distinctive silvery-white underside due to the dense covering of tiny, white hairs. This leaf characteristic is inherited from the white poplar parent.\n\nThe bark of the silver poplar is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured and darker with age. The tree produces catkins, which are the characteristic flowers of poplars, in early spring before the leaves emerge.\n\nThe silver poplar is a fast-growing tree that is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, including poor, dry, or wet soils. It is commonly used in landscaping and urban forestry due to its ornamental features and ability to tolerate a variety of environmental stresses.\n\nThe hybrid nature of Populus alba x Populus glandulosa combines the characteristics of both parent species, resulting in a tree that displays a unique combination of traits that may be desirable for certain applications or environmental conditions.",
