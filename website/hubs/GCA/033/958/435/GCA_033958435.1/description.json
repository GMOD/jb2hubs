  "description": "Carettochelys insculpta, commonly known as the pig-nosed turtle or Fly River turtle, is a freshwater turtle species native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea. It is the only living species in the family Carettochelyidae, which is considered one of the most primitive groups of living turtles.\n\nSome key scientific features of Carettochelys insculpta:\n\n1. Unique shell structure: The carapace (upper shell) and plastron (lower shell) are leathery and lack the typical bony scutes found in most other turtles. Instead, the shell is covered with soft, flexible skin.\n\n2. Paddle-like limbs: The turtle's limbs are modified into flipper-like structures, allowing it to swim efficiently in its aquatic habitat.\n\n3. Pig-like snout: The species is named for its distinctive pig-like snout, which is an adaptation for its omnivorous diet, feeding on aquatic plants, fish, and invertebrates.\n\n4. Restricted distribution: Carettochelys insculpta is found only in the Fly River basin in southern New Guinea and the Sepik and Ramu River systems in northern Australia, making it a geographically limited species.\n\n5. Conservation status: The pig-nosed turtle is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List due to threats such as habitat loss, hunting, and the pet trade.\n\nThis unique turtle species represents an important evolutionary lineage and plays a crucial role in the freshwater ecosystems it inhabits.",
