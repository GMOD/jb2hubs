  "description": "Canis latrans, commonly known as the coyote, is a small to medium-sized canid species native to North America. It is a highly adaptable and opportunistic predator, known for its distinctive yapping howl and its ability to thrive in diverse habitats, including urban and suburban areas.\n\nPhysically, Canis latrans is characterized by a pointed muzzle, erect triangular ears, and a bushy tail. Its fur can range in color from a mix of gray, tan, and black, which provides effective camouflage in its natural environments. Coyotes are typically smaller than their close relative, the gray wolf, with an average weight of 15-50 pounds (7-23 kg) and a height of 16-24 inches (40-60 cm) at the shoulder.\n\nBehaviorally, coyotes are highly intelligent and social animals, living in family groups or packs. They are primarily carnivorous, with a diverse diet that includes small mammals, birds, insects, and even fruits and berries. Coyotes are known for their ability to adapt to human-dominated landscapes, often thriving in suburban and urban areas where they take advantage of available food sources and exploiting the lack of natural predators.\n\nFrom an ecological perspective, Canis latrans plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of its ecosystems, acting as a top predator and helping to control the populations of smaller animals. Their adaptability and proliferation, however, have also led to conflicts with human populations, as they are sometimes perceived as a threat to livestock, pets, and even human safety.",
