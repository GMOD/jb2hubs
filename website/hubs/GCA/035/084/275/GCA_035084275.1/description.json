  "description": "Hydrolagus colliei, commonly known as the spotted ratfish or Pacific spookfish, is a species of cartilaginous fish belonging to the order Chimaeriformes. It is found in the northern Pacific Ocean, primarily along the coasts of western North America, from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nHydrolagus colliei is a small, elongated fish with a distinct, rounded snout and a long, whip-like tail. Its body is covered in small, placoid scales, giving it a smooth, velvety appearance. The species is notable for its distinctive spotted or mottled coloration, which can range from shades of gray to brown or olive-green, with white or yellowish spots or blotches.\n\nAs a member of the Chimaeriformes order, Hydrolagus colliei is closely related to the more well-known cartilaginous fishes, such as sharks and rays. However, it differs in several key aspects, including the presence of a single, venomous spine near the base of its tail and the lack of true jaws, instead having a beak-like structure used for feeding on small invertebrates and crustaceans.\n\nHydrolagus colliei is considered a relatively common and widespread species within its natural habitat, though its populations are not well studied. It is not considered a significant target for commercial or recreational fisheries, and its conservation status is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
