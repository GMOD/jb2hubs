  "description": "Candoia aspera, commonly known as the Solomon Islands ground boa or rough-scaled boa, is a species of non-venomous snake found in the Solomon Islands archipelago of the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the family Candoiidae, a group of small to medium-sized boas found in the region.\n\nThe Candoia aspera is a relatively small snake, typically growing to a length of around 1-1.5 meters (3-5 feet). It has a robust, stocky body and a distinct triangular-shaped head. Its scales are rough and keeled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The coloration of this species can vary, but it is often reddish-brown, grey, or dark brown, with darker patterns or bands running along the body.\n\nCandoia aspera is a terrestrial species, spending most of its time on the ground in forested habitats, including primary and secondary forests, as well as plantations and gardens. It is a nocturnal and secretive snake, generally avoiding human interaction. Its diet consists primarily of small rodents, birds, and other small vertebrates.\n\nThis species is considered to have a relatively stable population within its limited geographic range in the Solomon Islands. However, habitat loss and degradation due to human activities, such as logging and agricultural expansion, pose potential threats to its long-term survival.",
