  "description": "Trapa natans, commonly known as water chestnut or water caltrop, is an aquatic plant species that belongs to the family Lythraceae. It is a floating-leaved aquatic plant that is native to warm temperate regions of Eurasia and Africa.\n\nThe plant features a submerged root system and floating leaves that form a rosette on the water's surface. The leaves are rhombic or triangular in shape, with serrated edges. The plant produces striking, four-horned fruits that resemble a water caltrop, which is the origin of its common name.\n\nTrapa natans is an important food crop in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia, where the starchy nuts are harvested and consumed. It also plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms. However, the plant can be invasive in some regions, where it can form dense mats on the water's surface, disrupting the natural balance of the ecosystem.",
