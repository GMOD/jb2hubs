  "description": "Eleutherodactylus coqui, commonly known as the coquí or Puerto Rican coquí, is a small frog species native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the genus Eleutherodactylus, which is the largest genus of frogs in the world, comprising over 800 species.\n\nThe coquí is a small, terrestrial frog, typically measuring 3.0-5.5 cm in length. It has a distinct brown or grayish-brown coloration, with a dark stripe extending from the nostril to the eye and a cream-colored belly. The coquí is known for its unique call, which sounds like \"ko-kee\" or \"co-kee,\" and is a prominent feature of the Puerto Rican nighttime soundscape.\n\nThese frogs are adapted to a tropical, humid environment and are found in various habitats, including rainforests, cloud forests, and urban areas. They are nocturnal and primarily feed on small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders.\n\nReproduction in the coquí involves direct development, meaning the eggs hatch directly into tiny froglets without a free-swimming tadpole stage. The males defend small territories and call to attract females, who lay their eggs in moist locations, such as under leaves or in tree cavities.\n\nThe coquí is an important part of the Puerto Rican ecosystem, serving as a prey item for various predators and playing a role in the regulation of invertebrate populations. It is also a beloved cultural symbol of Puerto Rico and is often featured in local artwork, music, and literature.",
