  "description": "Myotis pilosus, commonly known as the hairy myotis or thick-furred bat, is a species of small bat belonging to the genus Myotis. This species is found in parts of Asia, including Japan, Korea, northeastern China, and the Russian Far East.\n\nMyotis pilosus is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of around 4-5 inches (10-12 cm) and a wingspan of approximately 9-11 inches (23-28 cm). The species is characterized by its dense, silky fur that covers its body, including the wing membranes and tail membrane. The fur is typically a grayish-brown or reddish-brown color, with the underparts being paler.\n\nThe hairy myotis is a nocturnal species that feeds primarily on insects, such as moths, beetles, and flies. It uses echolocation to navigate and locate its prey, emitting high-frequency calls that bounce off objects to create a \"sound map\" of its surroundings.\n\nThis bat species typically roosts in caves, abandoned buildings, and other sheltered areas. It forms small colonies, with individuals often clustering together for warmth and protection.\n\nMyotis pilosus plays an important role in the ecosystem, contributing to the control of insect populations. However, some populations of this species may be threatened by habitat loss and disturbance of their roosting sites.",
