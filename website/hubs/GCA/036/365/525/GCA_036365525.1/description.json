  "description": "Heterodontus francisci, commonly known as the Horn Shark, is a species of bullhead shark that belongs to the family Heterodontidae. This species is found along the Pacific coast of North America, ranging from Baja California, Mexico, to southern Oregon, United States.\n\nThe Horn Shark is a small, stocky shark with a blunt, rounded snout and two dorsal fins, the first of which is preceded by a small, sharp spine. The shark's distinctive features include its forward-facing eyes and the presence of unique grinding teeth at the back of its jaws, which it uses to crush the shells of its prey.\n\nHeterodontus francisci is a benthic, nocturnal species that typically inhabits shallow, rocky areas and kelp forests at depths ranging from a few meters to around 200 meters. Its diet consists primarily of mollusks, crustaceans, and small bony fishes. The Horn Shark is known for its ability to lock its jaws onto its prey, a behavior that helps it to consume its hard-shelled food items.\n\nThis species is ovoviviparous, meaning that the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the young are born live. Newborn Horn Sharks measure around 20 to 25 centimeters in length and are relatively independent from birth.\n\nOverall, the Horn Shark is a unique and fascinating member of the shark family, adapted to thrive in the coastal ecosystems of the eastern Pacific Ocean.",
