  "description": "Inia geoffrensis, commonly known as the Amazon river dolphin or pink dolphin, is a freshwater dolphin species found in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins of South America. It is the largest of the river dolphin species, with an average length of 2.5 meters and a weight of up to 185 kilograms.\n\nThe Inia geoffrensis has a distinctive appearance, with a robust, stocky body and a long, slender beak. Its skin can range in color from grayish-blue to pinkish-white, with the latter being more common in older individuals. The species is known for its ability to maneuver through the complex and often shallow river systems, using its flexible body and elongated flippers to navigate.\n\nInia geoffrensis is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic organisms. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, serving as a top predator and helping to maintain the balance of the river's food web.\n\nThe species is considered vulnerable due to various threats, including habitat loss, pollution, and accidental bycatch in fisheries. Conservation efforts, such as the establishment of protected areas and the development of sustainable fishing practices, are crucial to ensuring the long-term survival of this unique and remarkable freshwater dolphin.",
