It is a herbivorous, social animal that has been domesticated and used by humans for transportation, labor, and recreational purposes for thousands of years.\n\nEquus caballus is characterized by its muscular, four-legged build, a long neck, and a distinctive head with large eyes, pointed ears, and a mobile muzzle. They have a single hoof on each of their four legs, which is adapted for efficient locomotion on various terrains. Horses exhibit a diverse range of coat colors, including chestnut, bay, black, gray, and white, among others.\n\nHorses are highly intelligent and social animals, living in herd structures with complex communication and social behaviors. They are known for their speed, endurance, and strength, which have made them invaluable for a wide range of human activities, from agriculture and warfare to sports and leisure.\n\nDomestic horses are the result of the domestication of the now-extinct wild horse species, and they have been selectively bred by humans over generations to enhance desirable traits for various purposes. Equus caballus continues to play a significant role in many cultures and economies around the world.",
