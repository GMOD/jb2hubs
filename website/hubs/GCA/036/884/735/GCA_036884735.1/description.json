  "description": "Huso huso, commonly known as the Beluga sturgeon, is a large freshwater fish species belonging to the family Acipenseridae. It is native to the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea basins, found in the rivers flowing into these seas.\n\nThe Beluga sturgeon is characterized by its massive size, with individuals reaching lengths of up to 7 meters (23 feet) and weighing up to 1,600 kilograms (3,500 pounds), making it one of the largest freshwater fish species in the world. It has a distinctive elongated, streamlined body with a large, blunt snout and four barbels located on the underside of the snout, which it uses to locate and feed on a variety of prey, including small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nThe Beluga sturgeon is a long-lived species, with individuals living up to 100 years. It is an anadromous fish, meaning it migrates from the Caspian or Black Sea into the rivers to spawn, depositing its eggs on the riverbed. The species is of significant commercial and cultural importance, with its highly prized caviar being a valuable and sought-after commodity.\n\nHowever, the Beluga sturgeon is currently classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and other human-induced threats, making its conservation a critical priority for the sustainability of the species and the ecosystems it inhabits.",
