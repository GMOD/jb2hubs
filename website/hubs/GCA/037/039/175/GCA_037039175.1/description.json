  "description": "Microtus pennsylvanicus, commonly known as the meadow vole or Pennsylvania vole, is a small rodent species belonging to the genus Microtus, which is part of the family Cricetidae. These voles are found throughout North America, with a range that extends from Alaska and Canada to the northeastern and central United States.\n\nPhysically, Microtus pennsylvanicus is a small, stocky animal with a rounded body, short legs, and a short tail. They typically have a grayish-brown or reddish-brown fur coat, with a lighter-colored belly. Their average body length ranges from 12 to 18 centimeters, and they can weigh between 20 to 50 grams.\n\nEcologically, Microtus pennsylvanicus plays an important role as a primary consumer in grassland and meadow ecosystems. They are herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other vegetation. These voles are also a key prey species for many predators, including hawks, owls, snakes, and small carnivores.\n\nReproductively, Microtus pennsylvanicus is considered a prolific breeder, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year. They have a gestation period of around 21 days and can give birth to 3 to 6 young per litter.\n\nBehaviorally, Microtus pennsylvanicus is known for its social and territorial nature. They live in burrow systems and establish well-defined home ranges, which they defend against intruders. These voles are also known for their extensive runway systems, which they use for foraging and moving within their habitat.\n\nOverall, Microtus pennsylvanicus is an important component of many North American grassland and meadow ecosystems, playing a crucial role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of these habitats.",
