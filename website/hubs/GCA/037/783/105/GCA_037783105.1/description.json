  "description": "Bactrocera zonata, commonly known as the peach fruit fly or the guava fruit fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly native to parts of Asia, including India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It is considered a significant agricultural pest, as the larvae of this insect feed on a variety of fruits, including peaches, guavas, mangoes, and other commercially important crops.\n\nThe adult Bactrocera zonata flies are typically 6-8 mm in length, with a brownish-yellow body and distinctive dark bands on their wings. The females have a prominent ovipositor, which they use to lay their eggs inside the host fruit. The larvae, or maggots, hatch from the eggs and feed on the fruit's flesh, causing it to rot and become unfit for human consumption.\n\nBactrocera zonata is a significant threat to fruit production in many regions, as the larvae can cause substantial damage to the crop. The species is known for its high reproductive rate and ability to adapt to different environmental conditions, making it challenging to control. Integrated pest management strategies, including the use of pheromone traps, biological control agents, and targeted insecticide applications, are often employed to manage this pest species.",
