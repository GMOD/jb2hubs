It is native to the central and southeastern United States, found primarily in the Mississippi River basin and Gulf Coast region.\n\nThe blacktail shiner is a small, slender fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 10 centimeters (4 inches). Its most distinctive feature is the dark, wedge-shaped blotch at the base of its tail fin, which gives the species its common name. The body coloration is typically olive-green or silvery-gray, with a white or yellowish belly.\n\nCyprinella venusta is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic invertebrates, algae, and plant material. It plays an important role in the ecosystem as a forage fish, providing a food source for larger predatory species.\n\nThis species prefers clear, clean, and well-oxygenated streams, rivers, and reservoirs with gravel or rocky substrates. It is generally considered a hardy and adaptable fish, able to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.\n\nCyprinella venusta is an ecologically important species, contributing to the overall biodiversity and functioning of the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits. It is widely distributed and considered a common and stable species throughout much of its native range.",
