  "description": "Osmerus mordax, commonly known as the rainbow smelt or American smelt, is a small, slender fish species belonging to the family Osmeridae. It is native to the coastal regions of northeastern North America, ranging from Labrador, Canada, to New Jersey, United States.\n\nThe rainbow smelt is a euryhaline species, capable of living in both freshwater and saltwater environments. It typically inhabits estuaries, bays, and coastal areas, often migrating upstream into rivers and streams to spawn. The species is characterized by its elongated, silvery-green body with a distinct line of iridescent blue or green along its sides, giving it a \"rainbow-like\" appearance.\n\nOsmerus mordax is an important forage fish, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and marine mammals. It is also commercially and recreationally harvested, particularly during its spawning runs, when the fish congregate in large numbers. The species plays a vital role in the aquatic ecosystems it inhabits, contributing to the overall trophic dynamics and energy transfer within these environments.",
