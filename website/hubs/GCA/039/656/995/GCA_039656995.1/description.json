  "description": "Glossophaga mutica, commonly known as the Baja California long-tongued bat, is a species of nectar-feeding bat found in the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico. It is a small bat, with a body length of around 5-6 inches (12-15 cm) and a wingspan of approximately 12-15 inches (30-38 cm).\n\nThe Baja California long-tongued bat is characterized by its long, slender tongue, which it uses to feed on the nectar of various flowering plants, particularly agaves and cacti. This adaptation allows it to access the rich energy resources provided by these plants, which are essential for the bat's survival in the arid and semi-arid environments of the Baja California region.\n\nThese bats are typically found roosting in caves, crevices, and abandoned buildings, where they form small colonies. They are important pollinators in their native habitat, contributing to the reproductive success of many plant species.\n\nThe conservation status of Glossophaga mutica is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the species is widely distributed and not currently facing significant threats to its survival.",
