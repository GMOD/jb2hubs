  "description": "Chaetodon trifascialis, commonly known as the chevron butterflyfish or the three-banded butterflyfish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Chaetodontidae. This species is native to the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Hawaiian Islands and Pitcairn Islands.\n\nThe Chaetodon trifascialis is a small, laterally compressed fish with a distinctive coloration pattern. Its body is primarily yellow or golden-yellow, with three prominent dark vertical bands that extend from the dorsal fin to the ventral region. These bands give the fish a chevron-like appearance, hence the common name \"chevron butterflyfish.\"\n\nThe fish has a small, protractile mouth, which it uses to feed on a variety of small invertebrates, such as coral polyps, small crustaceans, and algae. Chaetodon trifascialis is known to be a specialized coral feeder, and its presence is often used as an indicator of the health of coral reef ecosystems.\n\nThis species typically grows to a maximum length of around 15 centimeters (6 inches) and has a lifespan of up to 15 years. Chaetodon trifascialis is found in shallow, tropical reef environments, often in close association with live coral formations, where it plays an important role in the overall balance and functioning of the coral reef ecosystem.",
