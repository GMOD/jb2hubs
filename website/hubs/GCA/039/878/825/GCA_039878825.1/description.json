  "description": "Excalfactoria chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese button quail or blue-breasted quail, is a small species of quail native to East and Southeast Asia. This species belongs to the family Coturnicidae, which includes several species of small quails found in various parts of the world.\n\nThe Chinese button quail is a diminutive bird, measuring approximately 12-15 cm in length and weighing around 40-60 grams. It has a distinctive blue-gray plumage on the upper parts, with a white belly and distinctive black-and-white striped pattern on the head and neck. The males have a bright blue patch on their breast, which is absent in the females.\n\nThis species is known for its ground-dwelling behavior and prefers habitats such as grasslands, scrublands, and cultivated fields. They are primarily seed-eaters, but they also consume a variety of small invertebrates, including insects and spiders.\n\nExcalfactoria chinensis is known for its unique courtship and breeding behavior. The males engage in elaborate displays, including wing-flapping and calling, to attract females. The females then construct a simple nest on the ground, where they lay a clutch of 4-8 eggs, which they incubate for approximately 16-18 days.\n\nThe Chinese button quail is widely distributed across East and Southeast Asia, with populations found in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and parts of Southeast Asia. While the species is not considered endangered, it faces threats from habitat loss and hunting in some regions.",
