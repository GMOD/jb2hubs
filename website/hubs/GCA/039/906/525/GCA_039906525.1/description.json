  "description": "Pseudorca crassidens, commonly known as the false killer whale, is a species of large, dark-colored dolphin that belongs to the family Delphinidae. It is the only living species in the genus Pseudorca.\n\nThe false killer whale is a highly social and intelligent marine mammal, capable of complex social behaviors and communication. It has a robust, torpedo-shaped body, a relatively small, rounded head, and a distinctive long, slender, beak-like snout. The species typically ranges in length from 4.5 to 6 meters (15 to 20 feet) and can weigh up to 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds).\n\nFalse killer whales are found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide, with a distribution that includes the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. They are known to form close-knit social groups and engage in cooperative hunting strategies, often targeting a variety of prey such as fish, squid, and other marine mammals.\n\nDespite their name, false killer whales are not closely related to the true killer whale (Orcinus orca) and belong to a separate genus. They are characterized by their unique dentition, with sharp, cone-shaped teeth that are well-suited for catching and holding their prey.\n\nThe conservation status of the false killer whale is classified as \"Near Threatened\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to various threats such as bycatch in fisheries, habitat degradation, and the potential impact of climate change on their marine ecosystems.",
