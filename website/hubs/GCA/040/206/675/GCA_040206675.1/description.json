  "description": "Ascaphus truei, commonly known as the tailed frog, is a unique species of frog found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. It belongs to the family Ascaphidae, which is considered one of the most primitive frog families.\n\nTailed frogs are small, typically measuring between 3 to 7 centimeters in length. They have a distinctive feature that sets them apart from other frogs - a tail-like structure that is present in both male and female individuals. This structure is not a true tail, but rather an extension of the cloaca, which is used during mating.\n\nTailed frogs are adapted to live in fast-flowing, cold mountain streams and rivers. They have large, flattened bodies and adhesive toe pads that allow them to cling to rocks and avoid being swept away by the strong currents. Their coloration, ranging from brown to olive-green, helps them blend in with their rocky habitats.\n\nThese frogs are nocturnal and primarily carnivorous, feeding on various aquatic invertebrates, such as insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. Reproduction in tailed frogs is unique, as the males use their tail-like structure to directly transfer sperm to the females, rather than relying on external fertilization.\n\nAscaphus truei is considered a sensitive species due to its specialized habitat requirements and vulnerability to environmental changes, such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ancient frog species.",
