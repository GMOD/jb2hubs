Habitat and Distribution: Corcyra cephalonica is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm and humid climates. It is commonly found in stored grain facilities, warehouses, and food processing plants.\n5. Economic Importance: The larvae of Corcyra cephalonica can cause significant damage to stored grains, reducing their quality, weight, and nutritional value. This makes the species a major pest of agricultural and food storage systems.\n\nOverall, Corcyra cephalonica is an important insect pest that poses a significant threat to the storage and preservation of various cereal crops and grains.",
