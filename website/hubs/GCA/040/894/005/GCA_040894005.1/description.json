  "description": "Engystomops pustulosus, commonly known as the Túngara frog, is a species of small frog belonging to the family Leptodactylidae. It is native to Central and South America, primarily found in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\nThe Túngara frog is a nocturnal and arboreal species, typically living in moist environments such as forests, scrublands, and grasslands. It is characterized by its rounded body, large eyes, and prominent parotoid glands behind the eyes. The skin of E. pustulosus is rough and warty, with a brownish or grayish coloration that helps it blend in with its surroundings.\n\nThese frogs are known for their distinctive mating calls, which consist of a series of \"pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-gu-gu-gu\" sounds, often described as sounding like a \"whine and chuck.\" The calls are used by males to attract females and defend their breeding territories.\n\nEngystomops pustulosus plays an important role in the ecosystems it inhabits, serving as a prey item for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. The species is not currently considered threatened, but its populations may be affected by factors such as habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.",
