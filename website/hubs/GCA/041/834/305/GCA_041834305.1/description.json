  "description": "Megaptera novaeangliae, commonly known as the humpback whale, is a species of large baleen whale that belongs to the Balaenopteridae family. These majestic marine mammals are known for their distinctive hump, long flippers, and impressive acrobatic displays, such as breaching and tail slapping.\n\nHumpback whales are characterized by their unique body shape, with a robust and rounded head, a long and narrow lower jaw, and a hump on their back that is followed by a series of knobs along their back. They have very long pectoral fins, which can reach up to one-third of their body length, and a distinctive, white pattern on their underside and flippers.\n\nThese whales are found in all the world's major oceans, with distinct populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. They are known for their complex and diverse vocalizations, which are believed to play a role in social interactions, communication, and navigation.\n\nHumpback whales are filter feeders, using their baleen plates to strain small prey, such as krill and small schooling fish, from the water. They are known for their unique feeding behaviors, including the \"bubble-net\" feeding technique, where they work collaboratively to corral and trap their prey.\n\nDespite their large size, humpback whales were once heavily hunted for their oil and meat, leading to significant population declines. However, conservation efforts and international protection measures have allowed their numbers to rebound in recent decades, though they remain classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
