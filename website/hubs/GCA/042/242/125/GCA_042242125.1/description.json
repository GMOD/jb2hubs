  "description": "Pempheris klunzingeri, commonly known as Klunzinger's sweeper, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Pempheridae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in the waters around the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the western Indian Ocean.\n\nPempheris klunzingeri is a small, laterally compressed fish with a deep, ovate body shape. It has a large, terminal mouth with small teeth, and a distinct lateral line that runs the length of its body. The fish's coloration is typically silvery or grayish, with a distinctive dark blotch at the base of the pectoral fins.\n\nThis species is often found in schools, swimming close to coral reefs, rocky outcrops, and other underwater structures, where it feeds on small planktonic organisms. Pempheris klunzingeri is considered a nocturnal species, as it is more active and visible during the night hours.\n\nPempheris klunzingeri plays a role in the ecosystem as a prey item for larger predatory fish and other marine organisms. It is not considered a commercially important species, but it may be occasionally caught as bycatch in some fishing operations.",
