  "description": "Doryrhina cyclops is a species of marine gastropod mollusk in the family Doryrhynchidae. It is a predatory sea snail that inhabits the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe shell of Doryrhina cyclops is small, typically less than 20 millimeters in length, and has a distinctive conical shape. The shell's surface is smooth and often bears a reddish-brown or orange coloration. The aperture, or opening, of the shell is relatively small and oval-shaped.\n\nThis species is known for its unique feeding mechanism, which involves using its long, thin proboscis to capture and consume other small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and other mollusks. The proboscis is equipped with a sharp, rasping tongue-like structure that allows the snail to drill through the shells or exoskeletons of its prey.\n\nDoryrhina cyclops is an important component of the marine ecosystem, contributing to the overall biodiversity and food web dynamics in the regions where it is found. Its presence and abundance can serve as an indicator of the health and stability of the local marine environment.",
