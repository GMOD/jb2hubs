  "description": "Rhinolophus yonghoiseni, commonly known as Yonghui's horseshoe bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Rhinolophidae, which is found in China. This species is named after Yonghui, the locality where the type specimen was collected.\n\nRhinolophus yonghoiseni is a medium-sized horseshoe bat, with a forearm length typically ranging from 43 to 47 millimeters. It has a distinctive nose-leaf, which is a complex structure on the nose that is characteristic of horseshoe bats. This species is known to roost in caves and abandoned buildings.\n\nThe taxonomy and distribution of Rhinolophus yonghoiseni are still not well-understood, and further research is needed to fully characterize its morphological features, genetic diversity, and ecological relationships within its native habitat in China.",
