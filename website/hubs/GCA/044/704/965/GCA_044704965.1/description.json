  "description": "Pristiophorus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese sawshark, is a species of sawshark that is found in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. This small shark belongs to the family Pristiophoridae and can be recognized by its elongated, flattened snout that is equipped with a pair of saw-like lateral extensions called rostral teeth.\n\nThe Japanese sawshark typically grows to a maximum length of around 1.2 meters (4 feet). It has a grayish-brown or olive-brown coloration on its dorsal side and a pale underside. This species is known to feed primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks that it detects and captures using its specialized rostral teeth.\n\nPristiophorus japonicus is considered a relatively rare and little-studied species. It inhabits coastal and continental shelf waters at depths ranging from around 50 to 400 meters (160 to 1,300 feet). The conservation status of this sawshark is currently listed as \"Near Threatened\" due to concerns over potential population declines and threats from commercial fisheries and habitat degradation.",
