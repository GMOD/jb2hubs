The male Willisornis vidua has a black head, back, and wings, with white spots on the wings and a white belly. The female, on the other hand, is predominantly brown in color, with a paler belly and some white spotting on the wings.\n\nWillisornis vidua inhabits tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, typically found in the understory and lower canopy levels. These birds are known to be territorial and can often be observed foraging for insects and other small prey, either alone or in mixed-species feeding flocks.\n\nThe species is widely distributed throughout its range, which includes parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia. It is generally considered to be of Least Concern in terms of conservation status, although local population declines may occur due to habitat loss and fragmentation.",
