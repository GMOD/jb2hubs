  "description": "Trichechus inunguis, commonly known as the Amazonian manatee or Amazonian sea cow, is a species of manatee found in the freshwater rivers and estuaries of the Amazon basin in South America. It is one of the four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes dugongs and the extinct Steller's sea cow.\n\nThe Amazonian manatee is a large, barrel-shaped aquatic mammal with a rounded, paddle-like tail and no hind limbs. It has a large, rounded head, small eyes, and a wrinkled, gray-brown skin that is sometimes covered in algae. Adults typically range from 2.5 to 3 meters in length and can weigh up to 500 kilograms.\n\nThese herbivorous mammals feed primarily on aquatic plants, such as water hyacinth and water lettuce, which they graze on using their sensitive, prehensile lips. They are slow-moving and social animals, often found in small groups or pairs.\n\nThe Amazonian manatee is considered a vulnerable species due to threats such as hunting, habitat loss, and entanglement in fishing nets. Conservation efforts, including protected areas and anti-poaching measures, are ongoing to help safeguard this unique aquatic mammal found only in the Amazon basin.",
