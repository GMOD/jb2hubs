It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, typically inhabiting coral reef and seagrass bed environments.\n\nSome key characteristics of Symphorus nematophorus:\n\n1. Appearance: It has an elongated, laterally compressed body with a blunt snout and a slightly protruding lower jaw. The body is covered with small, cycloid scales and is generally whitish or pale in color, with distinctive white spots or blotches along the sides.\n\n2. Size: Symphorus nematophorus can grow up to around 40 cm (16 inches) in total length.\n\n3. Habitat and Behavior: This species is typically found in shallow, coastal waters, often in association with coral reefs, rocky areas, and seagrass beds. It is a herbivorous fish, primarily feeding on various types of algae and seagrasses.\n\n4. Reproduction: Symphorus nematophorus reproduces through external fertilization, with the males and females releasing their gametes into the water column. The larvae undergo a pelagic larval stage before settling and metamorphosing into juvenile and adult forms.\n\n5. Ecological Importance: As a herbivorous fish, Symphorus nematophorus plays a role in the regulation of algal and seagrass communities within its habitat, contributing to the overall ecological balance of the reef and seagrass ecosystems it inhabits.\n\nThis species is of interest to both the commercial and recreational fishing industries in various regions of the Indo-Pacific, and it is also sometimes kept in home aquarium settings.",
