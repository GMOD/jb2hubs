  "description": "Caesio teres, commonly known as the humbug fusilier, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Caesionidae, which are part of the order Perciformes. The species is native to the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the Mariana Islands and southern Japan.\n\nThe Caesio teres is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of around 20-30 cm. It has an elongated, streamlined body shape and a small, protruding mouth. The coloration of the species is distinctive, with a silvery-white body and dark vertical bars or \"humbugs\" that give it a camouflage-like appearance.\n\nCaesio teres is a schooling fish, often found in large shoals near coral reefs, rocky areas, and lagoons. It feeds primarily on zooplankton and small crustaceans, playing an important role in the food web of its ecosystem. The species is considered to be of minor commercial importance, being sometimes targeted by subsistence and small-scale fisheries in its native range.\n\nFrom an ecological perspective, the Caesio teres is an important component of the coral reef community, contributing to the overall diversity and functioning of these diverse marine ecosystems.",
