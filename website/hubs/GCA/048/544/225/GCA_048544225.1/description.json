  "description": "Coilia mystus, commonly known as the goldspot grenadier, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Coiliidae. It is found in the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the eastern coast of Africa to the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Coilia mystus is a small, elongated fish with a unique appearance. It has a long, slender body with a large, rounded head and a prominent, downward-facing mouth. The fish's body is covered in small, ctenoid scales, and it has a distinctive golden or yellowish-brown coloration with dark spots or markings along its sides.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit estuaries, coastal lagoons, and shallow, nearshore areas, where it typically feeds on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other small invertebrates. Coilia mystus plays an important role in the local ecosystems, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and other marine animals.\n\nDue to its widespread distribution and relatively stable population, the Coilia mystus is currently classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
