  "description": "Mantella aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden mantella, is a species of frog belonging to the family Mantellidae. It is native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar, where it inhabits humid, rocky areas near streams and rivers.\n\nThe golden mantella is a small frog, with an average body length of around 25-30 millimeters. It has a distinctive bright orange or golden-yellow coloration, which serves as an aposematic signal to warn predators of its toxicity. The frog's skin secretes alkaloid compounds that make it unpalatable and potentially deadly to potential predators.\n\nMantella aurantiaca is an arboreal species, spending much of its time in the vegetation near its aquatic breeding sites. It reproduces during the rainy season, with males calling from hidden perches to attract females. The female lays her eggs in small pools or seeps, and the tadpoles develop in the water before metamorphosing into froglets.\n\nThe golden mantella is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as collection for the pet trade. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding programs, are ongoing to protect this unique and vibrant amphibian.",
