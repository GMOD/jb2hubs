These primates are found in the tropical rainforests of Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil.\n\nPhysically, Saimiri boliviensis is characterized by a slender build, a rounded head, and large, expressive eyes. They have a distinctive facial mask with a black crown and golden-colored facial features. Their fur is generally yellowish-green on the back and white on the underside. These squirrel monkeys have a long, prehensile tail that aids in their arboreal lifestyle.\n\nBehaviorally, Saimiri boliviensis is known to be highly social, living in large multi-male, multi-female troops. They are diurnal and exhibit a complex social structure with various vocalizations and body language to communicate. These primates are primarily frugivorous, supplementing their diet with insects, small vertebrates, and flowers.\n\nSaimiri boliviensis is considered a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and fragmentation in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species and its critical tropical forest ecosystems.",
