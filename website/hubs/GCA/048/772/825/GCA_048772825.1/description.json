  "description": "Callospermophilus lateralis, commonly known as the golden-mantled ground squirrel, is a species of small rodent in the family Sciuridae. It is found in the western regions of North America, ranging from British Columbia to Baja California and from the Pacific Coast to the Rocky Mountains.\n\nThe golden-mantled ground squirrel is characterized by its distinctive coloration, with a golden or yellowish-brown mantle that extends along the sides of its body, contrasting with the darker brown or black dorsal and ventral regions. It has a relatively short, rounded head, large eyes, and a bushy tail. The species is typically 20-30 cm in length, with a body weight ranging from 150 to 350 grams.\n\nThese ground squirrels are primarily diurnal, emerging from their underground burrows during the day to forage for a variety of plant materials, including seeds, nuts, berries, and occasionally insects. They are known for their agile movements and their ability to climb trees and rocks.\n\nCallospermophilus lateralis is an important prey species for various predators, such as coyotes, foxes, and birds of prey. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem, contributing to the dispersal of seeds and the regulation of insect populations. The species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, with stable populations throughout its range.",
