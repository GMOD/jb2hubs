  "description": "Suid alphaherpesvirus 1, also known as Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1) or Aujeszky's disease virus, is a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily within the Herpesviridae family. It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects and causes disease in pigs (Sus scrofa), the natural host.\n\nThe virus is characterized by its ability to establish latent infections in the sensory ganglia of the host, from which it can periodically reactivate and cause recurrent disease. SuHV-1 has a broad host range and can infect various other mammalian species, including cattle, sheep, goats, and carnivores, though pigs are the primary reservoir.\n\nInfection in pigs can result in a range of clinical manifestations, including respiratory distress, reproductive disorders, and fatal encephalitis, particularly in young animals. SuHV-1 is considered an important pathogen in the swine industry, causing significant economic losses and posing a threat to animal welfare.\n\nThe virus is transmitted primarily through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, as well as through indirect means, such as contaminated fomites or vehicles. Effective prevention and control strategies involve biosecurity measures, vaccination, and comprehensive herd management practices.",
