  "description": "Triticum turgidum subsp. durum, commonly known as durum wheat or macaroni wheat, is a subspecies of the tetraploid wheat species Triticum turgidum. It is a major cereal crop cultivated primarily for the production of semolina, a coarse flour used in the making of pasta, couscous, and other food products.\n\nDurum wheat is characterized by its hard, amber-colored kernels and high protein content, which makes it well-suited for pasta production. The plant typically grows to a height of 0.6 to 1.2 meters, with a spike-like inflorescence that bears the grains. Durum wheat is adapted to grow in warm, dry climates and is primarily cultivated in the Mediterranean region, the Great Plains of North America, and other areas with similar environmental conditions.\n\nGenetically, Triticum turgidum subsp. durum is a tetraploid wheat, meaning it has four sets of chromosomes (2n=4x=28). This genetic makeup contributes to its unique characteristics, such as the hard texture of the kernels and the high gluten content, which is essential for pasta-making.",
