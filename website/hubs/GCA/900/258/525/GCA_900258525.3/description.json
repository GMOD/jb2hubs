  "description": "Culicoides sonorensis is a species of biting midge, also known as a no-see-um or punkies, belonging to the family Ceratopogonidae. It is a small, delicate, blood-feeding insect that is commonly found in various parts of North America.\n\nCulicoides sonorensis is known for its role as a vector, or carrier, of various livestock diseases, such as bluetongue virus and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus. These viruses can be transmitted to domestic and wild ruminants, such as sheep, goats, and deer, through the bites of infected C. sonorensis midges.\n\nThe adults of C. sonorensis are small, measuring around 1-3 millimeters in length, and have a grayish-brown coloration with distinctive wing patterns. The females are the ones that feed on blood, which they require for the development of their eggs. The larvae of this species live in moist, organic-rich habitats, such as standing water, mud, or decaying vegetation.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and ecology of Culicoides sonorensis is important for the management and control of the diseases it can transmit, as well as for the mitigation of its biting nuisance to both humans and animals in areas where it is prevalent.",
