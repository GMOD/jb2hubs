  "description": "Parambassis ranga, commonly known as the Indian glassy fish or Indian glassy perchlet, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Ambassidae. It is native to the Indian subcontinent, where it is found in rivers, streams, and lakes across India, Bangladesh, and Nepal.\n\nThe Indian glassy fish is a small, elongated fish with a transparent body and distinctive large eyes. It typically grows to a maximum length of around 7-10 centimeters. The species has a compressed, laterally flattened body shape, which helps it navigate through dense aquatic vegetation.\n\nParambassis ranga is an omnivorous fish, feeding on a variety of small aquatic organisms, including zooplankton, insect larvae, and algae. It plays an important role in the aquatic food web, serving as a prey species for larger predatory fish.\n\nThe Indian glassy fish is known for its unique behavior of schooling, with individuals often forming tight-knit groups that move in a synchronized manner. This behavior is believed to be a defense mechanism against predators and to facilitate more efficient foraging.\n\nDue to its small size and transparent appearance, the Indian glassy fish is a popular aquarium species, particularly among hobbyists interested in unique and visually striking freshwater fish. However, overfishing and habitat degradation have led to population declines in some regions, making it a species of conservation concern in certain areas.",
