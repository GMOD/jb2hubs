  "description": "Sparus aurata, commonly known as the gilthead seabream or gilt-head bream, is a species of marine fish that belongs to the family Sparidae. It is a popular food fish found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, and the eastern Atlantic Ocean, from the British Isles to Senegal.\n\nSparus aurata is a demersal fish, meaning it lives and feeds near the seafloor. It has a distinctive golden-yellow spot between its eyes, which gives it the name \"gilt-head.\" The body is laterally compressed and oval-shaped, with a small terminal mouth and large scales. The coloration of the fish varies, with a silvery-gray back and a white or yellowish belly.\n\nSparus aurata is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of prey, including small fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and benthic invertebrates. It is a protandric hermaphrodite, meaning that individuals first mature as males and can later change sex to become females.\n\nThe gilthead seabream is an important commercial and recreational species, with a high market value. It is cultured extensively in Mediterranean aquaculture facilities, and wild populations are also targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries.",
