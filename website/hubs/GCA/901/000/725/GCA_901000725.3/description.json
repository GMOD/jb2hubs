  "description": "Takifugu rubripes, also known as the Japanese pufferfish or tiger pufferfish, is a species of pufferfish native to the coastal waters of East Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea. It is a member of the family Tetraodontidae, known for their unique ability to inflate their bodies when threatened.\n\nThe Takifugu rubripes is a small to medium-sized fish, typically ranging from 30 to 50 centimeters in length. It has a distinctive, rounded body with a large, protruding mouth and small, beak-like teeth. The skin of the Takifugu rubripes is covered with small, sharp spines that can be raised when the fish is threatened, allowing it to increase its apparent size and deter predators.\n\nThis species is well-known for its high content of the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin, which makes it potentially deadly if not prepared properly. However, it is considered a delicacy in Japanese cuisine and is widely consumed in Japan, where the preparation of the fish is a highly specialized skill.\n\nThe Takifugu rubripes is an important model organism in genetics and developmental biology research, as its genome has been extensively studied and sequenced, providing valuable insights into vertebrate evolution and genomic structure.",
