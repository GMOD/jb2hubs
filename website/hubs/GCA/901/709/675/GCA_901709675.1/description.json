  "description": "Syngnathus acus, also known as the European or common seahorse, is a species of seahorse native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. It is a small, slender fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae, which includes seahorses, pipefish, and sea dragons.\n\nThe European seahorse has a distinctive elongated body with a prehensile tail, which it uses to cling to various marine structures, such as seagrass, algae, and coral. Its head is horse-like in appearance, with a long, tubular snout that it uses to suck in small prey, such as shrimp, small crustaceans, and plankton.\n\nSyngnathus acus is known for its unique reproductive behavior, where the male seahorse carries the fertilized eggs in a specialized pouch until they hatch. This adaptation is a key characteristic of the Syngnathidae family. The species typically measures between 15 and 25 centimeters in length and can live for up to 5 years in the wild.\n\nThe European seahorse is listed as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but it faces threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and overfishing in some regions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this fascinating and unique marine species.",
