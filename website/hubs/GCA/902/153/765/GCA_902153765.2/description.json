  "description": "Aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos, commonly known as the Golden Eagle, is a large raptor species belonging to the family Accipitridae. This subspecies is found in the Palearctic region, spanning across Europe, North Asia, and parts of North America.\n\nThe Golden Eagle is characterized by its impressive wingspan, reaching up to 2.3 meters, and its distinctive plumage. The adult birds have a dark brown body with golden-brown feathers on the back of the head and neck, giving them a \"golden\" appearance. Their tails are dark with a white base, and their legs are feathered down to the toes.\n\nThese eagles are known for their exceptional hunting abilities, primarily preying on small to medium-sized mammals, such as hares, rabbits, and ground squirrels. They are adept at soaring and gliding, using their keen eyesight to spot their prey from great distances. Their hunting strategy often involves stooping from high altitudes to capture their prey with their powerful talons.\n\nAquila chrysaetos chrysaetos is widely distributed across its range, inhabiting various ecosystems, including mountainous regions, forests, and open habitats. They are skilled at building large, stick-constructed nests on cliffs, trees, or human-made structures, where they raise their young.\n\nThe Golden Eagle is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although some populations may face threats from habitat loss, human disturbance, and persecution in certain regions.",
