  "description": "Cloeon dipterum is a species of mayfly belonging to the order Ephemeroptera. It is a small insect, typically measuring around 10-15 millimeters in length. Cloeon dipterum is found in a wide range of freshwater habitats, including streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes, across Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nThe species has a unique life cycle, with a larval stage that lives in the water and a short-lived adult stage that emerges from the water to mate and reproduce. The larvae, known as nymphs, are aquatic and feed on algae, detritus, and other organic matter. They undergo a series of molts, or ecdysis, as they grow and develop.\n\nCloeon dipterum is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, serving as a food source for various predators, such as fish, birds, and other invertebrates. Additionally, the presence of Cloeon dipterum is often used as an indicator of water quality, as they are sensitive to pollution and environmental changes.\n\nThe species is widely distributed and is not considered to be under significant threat, although it may face challenges due to habitat degradation and pollution in some regions.",
