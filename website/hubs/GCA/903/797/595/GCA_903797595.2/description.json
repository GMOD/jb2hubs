  "description": "Erithacus rubecula, commonly known as the European robin or simply the robin, is a small passerine bird of the family Muscicapidae. This species is native to Europe, northwestern Africa, and western Asia, and is a popular and familiar garden bird throughout its range.\n\nThe European robin is a small, round-bodied bird with a distinctive orange-red face and breast, contrasted by a grey back and wings. It has a relatively large head, dark eyes, and a small, thin beak. The species is known for its bold, inquisitive behavior and its cheerful, melodious song, which is often heard throughout the year.\n\nRobins are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of invertebrates, such as spiders, caterpillars, and beetles. They also supplement their diet with berries and small fruits. The species is known for its territorial behavior, aggressively defending its breeding and foraging areas from other individuals.\n\nRobins are monogamous and typically form pair bonds during the breeding season, which can last from March to September. They build cup-shaped nests in sheltered locations, such as tree cavities or crevices, and lay a clutch of 4-7 eggs, which are incubated for approximately 12-14 days. The young robins fledge after about 14-16 days, but continue to be fed by their parents for several weeks after leaving the nest.\n\nThe European robin is a widely studied and well-known species, and its conservation status is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
