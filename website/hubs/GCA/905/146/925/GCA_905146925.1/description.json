It is a medium-sized moth with a wingspan of around 35-45 millimeters.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of Autographa gamma is the silver-colored Y-shaped mark on its forewings, which gives the moth its common name. The hindwings are typically grayish-white, and the body is covered in grayish-brown scales.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is known to be a migratory species, with populations moving long distances in search of suitable habitats and food sources.\n\nThe larvae of Autographa gamma, commonly referred to as the silver Y caterpillar, are known to feed on a variety of plant species, including various crops and garden plants. They can be considered agricultural pests in some regions due to their potential to cause damage to crops.\n\nAutographa gamma plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator, as the adults feed on the nectar of various flowers. Additionally, the species is of interest to researchers and lepidopterists due to its migratory behavior and its potential use as a bioindicator of environmental changes.",
