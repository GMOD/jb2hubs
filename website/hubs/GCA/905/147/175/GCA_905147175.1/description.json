  "description": "Nymphalis urticae, commonly known as the small tortoiseshell or small tortoiseshell butterfly, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is found throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa.\n\nThe small tortoiseshell is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 45-55 millimeters. Its wings are orange-red in color with distinctive black, yellow, and blue markings. The upper side of the wings has a striking pattern of black, yellow, and blue, while the underside is more muted in shades of brown and gray.\n\nThe small tortoiseshell is a generalist species, meaning it feeds on a variety of nectar-producing plants. Its caterpillars primarily feed on the leaves of stinging nettles (Urtica spp.), hence the species name \"urticae.\"\n\nThe small tortoiseshell is known for its ability to overwinter as an adult, often finding shelter in buildings or hollow trees. It is a common and widely distributed species that plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator and as a food source for various predators.",
