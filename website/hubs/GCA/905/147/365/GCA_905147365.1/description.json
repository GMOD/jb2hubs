  "description": "Aricia agestis, commonly known as the brown argus, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is found throughout Europe and parts of Asia, typically inhabiting grasslands, heaths, and open woodland habitats.\n\nThe brown argus has a wingspan of approximately 30-35 millimeters. The upperside of the wings is a distinctive brown color, with a series of small white spots near the outer edge. The underside of the wings is paler, with a pattern of white and brown spots and lines.\n\nThe lifecycle of the brown argus involves the female laying her eggs on various species of Geraniaceae plants, such as Geranium and Erodium. The caterpillars that hatch from these eggs feed on the leaves of these plants, going through several molts before pupating and emerging as adult butterflies.\n\nAricia agestis is considered a relatively common and widespread species, but it can be sensitive to habitat changes and management practices. Conservation efforts focused on maintaining suitable grassland and heathland habitats are important for the continued survival of this delicate butterfly species.",
