  "description": "Limenitis camilla, commonly known as the white admiral or white-letter hairstreak, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is found in various parts of Europe and Asia.\n\nThe white admiral has a wingspan of approximately 50-65 millimeters. The upper side of its wings is predominantly black with distinctive white bands across both the fore and hindwings. The underside of the wings is brown with white markings and a row of orange-red spots near the outer edge.\n\nThis butterfly species typically inhabits deciduous forests, woodland edges, and areas with a mix of shrubs and trees. The larvae feed on species of honeysuckle (Lonicera), which are the primary host plants for this butterfly.\n\nLimenitis camilla undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with distinct egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (imago) stages. The adults are known to engage in territorial behavior and display complex courtship rituals.\n\nThe white admiral is an important component of forest ecosystems, playing a role in pollination and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the habitats it occupies. Conservation efforts to protect its populations and their associated habitats are crucial for the long-term preservation of this species.",
