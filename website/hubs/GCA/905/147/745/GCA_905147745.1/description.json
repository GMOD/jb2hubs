  "description": "Phlogophora meticulosa, commonly known as the Angle Shades moth, is a species of nocturnal moth belonging to the family Noctuidae. This species is widely distributed across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nThe Angle Shades moth has a wingspan of approximately 40-50 millimeters. Its wings are delicately patterned with various shades of brown, gray, and green, which helps the moth camouflage itself amongst the bark and foliage of its natural habitat. The distinctive feature of this moth is the \"angle\" formed by the outer edge of its forewings, which gives it a characteristic appearance.\n\nThe larvae of the Angle Shades moth are typically green or brown in color, with a slender body and a small head. They feed on a variety of herbaceous plants, including nettle, dandelion, and various other low-growing vegetation.\n\nThe Angle Shades moth is known for its ability to hibernate during the winter months, emerging in the spring to mate and lay its eggs. The adults are often observed during the summer and autumn seasons, attracted to artificial lights and various floral nectar sources.\n\nOverall, the Angle Shades moth is a common and widespread species that plays a role in the ecosystem as a pollinator and a source of food for predators.",
