  "description": "Craniophora ligustri, commonly known as the Coronet moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Acronictinae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nThe Coronet moth has a wingspan ranging from 35 to 45 millimeters. Its forewings are typically grey or greyish-brown in color, with distinct markings that resemble a crown or coronet, hence the common name. The hindwings are generally pale grey or whitish.\n\nThe larvae of the Coronet moth, also known as caterpillars, feed primarily on the leaves of common privet (Ligustrum vulgare), which is the host plant for this species. The caterpillars have a distinctive appearance, with a black head and a pale green or yellowish-green body.\n\nCraniophora ligustri is generally found in woodland habitats, gardens, and urban areas where its host plant, the common privet, is present. The species undergoes a single generation per year, with adults typically emerging in the spring or early summer months.\n\nThis moth plays a role in the ecosystem as a herbivore, feeding on the foliage of its host plant, and as a potential food source for predators. Additionally, the Coronet moth is considered a common and widespread species within its natural range.",
