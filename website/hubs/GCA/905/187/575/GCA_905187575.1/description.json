  "description": "Celastrina argiolus, commonly known as the Holly Blue, is a species of small blue butterfly belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is widely distributed across Europe, North Africa, and Asia.\n\nThe Holly Blue has a wingspan of approximately 25-30 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is a bright, iridescent blue color in the males, while the females have a more greyish-blue appearance. The underside of the wings is pale grey with distinct black spots and markings.\n\nThe species typically inhabits woodland, scrubland, and gardens where its larval host plants, such as holly, ivy, and dogwood, are present. The larvae feed on the flowers and young berries of these plants, while the adults feed on the nectar of various flowering plants.\n\nCelastrina argiolus undergoes multiple generations per year, with the number of broods varying depending on the geographic location. The butterfly is known for its ability to produce more than one generation within a single season, a characteristic known as polyvoltinism.\n\nThe Holly Blue is considered a relatively common and widespread species throughout its range, although populations can fluctuate due to various environmental factors, such as changes in habitat and weather conditions.",
