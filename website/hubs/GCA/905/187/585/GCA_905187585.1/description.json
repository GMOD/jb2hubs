It is native to Europe, Asia Minor, and parts of North Africa.\n\nThe Mazarine Blue has a wingspan of approximately 28-34 mm. The upper side of the wings is a distinctive blue color, with a darker border in the males and a more mottled appearance in the females. The underside of the wings is greyish-brown with white-edged black spots, giving the butterfly a characteristic appearance.\n\nThe species is found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and open woodland areas. The larvae of the Mazarine Blue feed on various species of clover (Trifolium) and other leguminous plants. The adults are known to visit a range of nectar-producing flowers, such as thistles, knapweeds, and scabious.\n\nCyaniris semiargus is considered a relatively common and widespread species within its range, although its populations may be declining in some areas due to factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation. The species is an important component of the local ecosystem, playing a role in the pollination of various plant species.",
