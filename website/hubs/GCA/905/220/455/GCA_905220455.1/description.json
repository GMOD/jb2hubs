It is a small to medium-sized hawk-moth with a distinctive coloration and patterning.\n\nThe wingspan of Deilephila porcellus typically ranges from 45 to 55 millimeters.

The hindwings are bright pink, with a dark band near the outer edge.\n\nThe caterpillars of Deilephila porcellus are also distinctive, with a large, eye-like spot on the thorax and a tapering, trunk-like head, which gives them a resemblance to small elephants, hence the common name. The caterpillars feed on various species of willowherb (Epilobium) and bedstraw (Galium).\n\nDeilephila porcellus is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, and it is commonly found in habitats such as woodlands, gardens, and urban areas where its host plants are present.
