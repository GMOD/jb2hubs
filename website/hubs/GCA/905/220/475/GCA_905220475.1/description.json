  "description": "Ennomos fuscantarius is a species of moth belonging to the family Ennominae, commonly known as the dusky thorn. It is native to Europe, including parts of Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and Central Europe.\n\nThe dusky thorn moth has a wingspan of approximately 35-45 millimeters. Its wings are typically brown or greyish-brown in color, with darker markings and a distinctive toothed or serrated appearance along the outer edge of the wings. The hindwings are usually paler in color compared to the forewings.\n\nThe larvae of the dusky thorn moth are known as \"geometrid\" or \"inchworm\" caterpillars, characterized by their looping movement as they walk. They feed on the leaves of various deciduous trees, such as oak, birch, and alder, and can sometimes be considered a minor forest pest due to their potential for defoliation.\n\nThe dusky thorn moth is generally active during the night, and adults can be attracted to artificial light sources. The species undergoes a single generation per year, with the adults typically flying between August and October in most parts of its range.\n\nOverall, the dusky thorn moth is a relatively common and widespread species within its native European distribution, playing a role in the local forest ecosystem as a herbivore and as a food source for various predators.",
