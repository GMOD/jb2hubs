  "description": "Melitaea cinxia, commonly known as the Glanville fritillary, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 35-45 millimeters.\n\nThe Glanville fritillary's upper wings are orange-brown in color, with distinctive black markings and spots. The hindwings are typically dark brown with a series of orange-brown spots along the outer edge. The underside of the wings is more muted in color, with a pattern of pale and dark patches.\n\nThis species is found in Europe and parts of Asia, inhabiting a range of grassland and open woodland habitats. The larvae of the Glanville fritillary feed on plantain (Plantago) species, and the adults are known to visit a variety of flowering plants to feed on nectar.\n\nMelitaea cinxia is considered a relatively common and widespread species in parts of its range, though it has experienced declines in some areas due to habitat loss and fragmentation. The species plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a pollinator and as a food source for other organisms.",
