The hindwings are pale grey. The body is slender and covered with greyish-brown scales.\n\nThe larvae of Tinea trinotella feed primarily on natural fibers, such as wool, silk, and fur, making them a significant pest in households and textile industries. The larvae construct portable cases from the materials they consume, which they carry with them as they move and feed.\n\nTinea trinotella is widely distributed throughout Europe and parts of Asia. It is known to be a common household pest, often found in closets, wardrobes, and areas where natural fiber-based materials are stored. The species plays a role in the decomposition of keratin-based materials in the natural environment.",
