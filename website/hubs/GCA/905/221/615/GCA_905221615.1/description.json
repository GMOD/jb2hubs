  "description": "Symbiodinium sp. CCMP2592 is a species of single-celled dinoflagellate algae that commonly forms symbiotic relationships with various marine invertebrates, particularly reef-building corals. This species is classified within the genus Symbiodinium, which contains a diverse group of endosymbiotic microalgae that play a crucial role in the health and functioning of coral reef ecosystems.\n\nSymbiodinium sp. CCMP2592 is a photosynthetic organism that resides within the cells of its host, providing the coral with essential nutrients and energy derived from the process of photosynthesis. In return, the coral provides the algae with a stable and nutrient-rich environment, as well as protection from predators and other environmental stressors.\n\nThis particular strain of Symbiodinium was isolated from an unknown host and is maintained in culture at the Provasoli-Guillard National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (CCMP). As a model organism, Symbiodinium sp. CCMP2592 has been extensively studied to understand the complex and dynamic symbiotic relationships between dinoflagellates and their invertebrate hosts, as well as the responses of these systems to environmental changes and stressors, such as those associated with climate change and ocean acidification.",
