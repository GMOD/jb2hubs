  "description": "Boloria selene, commonly known as the small pearl-bordered fritillary, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is a medium-sized butterfly with distinctive orange and brown patterned wings.\n\nThe upper side of the wings is orange-brown with dark brown spots and markings, while the underside is patterned with shades of brown and has a row of silvery-white spots near the outer edge. The hindwings have a distinct row of pearl-like spots, which gives the species its common name.\n\nBoloria selene is found across Europe and Asia, inhabiting a range of habitats, including grasslands, heathlands, and woodland edges. The larvae feed on various violet species, including Viola riviniana and Viola canina, while the adults primarily nectar on flowers such as bramble, knapweed, and thistles.\n\nThis butterfly species is known for its adaptability and can thrive in both natural and managed landscapes, though it is sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation. Conservation efforts aimed at preserving and restoring suitable habitats are important for the continued survival of the small pearl-bordered fritillary.",
