  "description": "Eimeria tenella is a species of protozoan parasite that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It is the causative agent of coccidiosis, a significant intestinal disease in domestic chickens.\n\nE. tenella is an obligate intracellular parasite that primarily infects the epithelial cells of the chicken's cecum, the two blind-ended pouches at the junction of the small and large intestines. The parasite's life cycle involves both asexual (schizogony) and sexual (gametogony) stages, culminating in the production of resistant oocysts that are shed in the host's feces.\n\nInfection with E. tenella can lead to severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, decreased weight gain, and, in severe cases, mortality in chickens. The parasite's ability to rapidly multiply within the host's cells and disrupt the intestinal lining contributes to the pathogenicity of this species.\n\nE. tenella is an important economic concern for the poultry industry, as it can cause significant production losses and veterinary treatment costs. Understanding the biology and life cycle of this parasite is crucial for the development of effective control strategies, such as vaccines and chemotherapeutic agents, to mitigate the impact of coccidiosis in commercial chicken production.",
