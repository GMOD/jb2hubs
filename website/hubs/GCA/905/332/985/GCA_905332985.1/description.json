  "description": "Mimas tiliae, commonly known as the lime hawk-moth or lime hawk, is a species of moth belonging to the family Sphingidae. It is native to Europe, where it is widely distributed from the Iberian Peninsula to the Ural Mountains.\n\nThe Mimas tiliae moth has a wingspan ranging from 80 to 100 millimeters. Its forewings are greyish-brown with darker markings, while the hindwings are pinkish-red with a dark grey band. The caterpillars, known as the lime hawk-moth larvae, are typically green with yellow oblique stripes along the sides and a horn-like structure at the rear end.\n\nThese moths are known to be active during the night and are attracted to artificial lights. The larvae feed primarily on the leaves of lime trees (Tilia spp.), hence the common name \"lime hawk-moth.\" The species undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the eggs hatching into larvae, which then pupate and emerge as adult moths.\n\nMimas tiliae is considered a harmless species and is not known to cause significant damage to its host plants. It is often observed in urban and suburban areas where lime trees are present, and its distinctive appearance and behavior make it a fascinating subject for lepidopterists and nature enthusiasts.",
