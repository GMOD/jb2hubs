  "description": "Lycaena phlaeas, commonly known as the Small Copper, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is a small, brightly colored butterfly that is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.\n\nThe Small Copper has a wingspan of approximately 25-35 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is a vibrant copper-orange color, with a black border and dark spots. The underside of the wings is paler, with a series of distinctive black spots and a reddish-brown border.\n\nThe lifecycle of the Small Copper includes four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. The larvae feed primarily on various species of sorrel (Rumex), a type of plant that is commonly found in their natural habitats. The butterflies are often seen feeding on nectar-rich flowers, such as those from the Asteraceae family.\n\nLycaena phlaeas is known for its adaptability and can be found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, heathlands, and even urban areas. It is considered a relatively common and widespread species throughout its range, although its populations may be affected by habitat loss and changes in land management practices.",
