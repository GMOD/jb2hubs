  "description": "Hesperia comma, commonly known as the silver-spotted skipper, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Hesperiidae. It is found across Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nThe butterfly has a wingspan of approximately 25-35 millimeters. Its distinctive feature is the presence of a prominent silvery-white spot on the underside of its hindwings, which gives it its common name. The upper surface of the wings is dark brown or black, with yellowish-white spots and markings.\n\nHesperia comma larvae feed on various grass species, including fescues and brome grasses. The adults are known to visit a variety of nectar-producing flowers, including thistles, knapweeds, and clovers.\n\nThe species is generally considered common and widespread within its range, but its populations can be affected by habitat loss and changes in land management practices, such as the overuse of herbicides or the abandonment of traditional grazing regimes.",
