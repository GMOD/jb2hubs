  "description": "Fabriciana adippe, commonly known as the High Brown Fritillary, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. This species is found across Europe, ranging from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean region.\n\nThe High Brown Fritillary has a wingspan of approximately 60-70 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is orange-brown in color, with dark brown veins and black spots. The underside of the hindwings displays a distinctive pattern of silvery-white spots on a reddish-brown background.\n\nThe larvae of Fabriciana adippe feed on various species of violets (Viola spp.), which serve as their host plants. The females lay their eggs on the leaves or stems of the host plants. The larvae hatch and go through several instars, eventually pupating and emerging as adult butterflies.\n\nThis species is considered a habitat specialist, preferring open woodland and scrubland habitats with a diverse abundance of its host plants. Due to habitat loss and other environmental factors, the High Brown Fritillary has experienced population declines in many parts of its range, making it a conservation concern in some regions.",
