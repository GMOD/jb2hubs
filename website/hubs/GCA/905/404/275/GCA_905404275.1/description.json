  "description": "Hedya salicella is a species of moth belonging to the family Tortricidae, commonly known as the willow tortrix. It is a small moth with a wingspan of around 12-16 millimeters.\n\nThe forewings of Hedya salicella are greyish-brown with indistinct darker markings, while the hindwings are greyish-brown. The larvae, or caterpillars, of this species feed on the leaves and buds of various willow (Salix) species, which is the reason for the common name \"willow tortrix.\"\n\nHedya salicella is found across Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Russia, and its distribution extends to North Africa and parts of Asia. It is generally considered a common and widespread species within its range.\n\nThe life cycle of Hedya salicella typically involves the larvae feeding on willow plants during the spring and early summer, with the adult moths emerging later in the summer and early autumn. The species overwinters in the pupal stage, with the adults emerging the following year to continue the reproductive cycle.",
