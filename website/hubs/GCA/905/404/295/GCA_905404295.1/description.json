It is found in various parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and parts of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Essex Skipper is a small to medium-sized butterfly, with a wingspan typically ranging from 30 to 35 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is dark brown, while the underside is a paler brown with a distinct pattern of yellow or pale spots on the hindwings.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and open woodland areas. The larvae of the Essex Skipper feed on various grass species, such as Cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata) and False Brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum).\n\nThe lifecycle of the Essex Skipper includes the egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult stages. The butterflies are typically observed during the summer months, from June to August, when they can be seen feeding on nectar-rich flowers.\n\nConservation efforts for the Essex Skipper are ongoing, as some populations have faced declines due to factors such as habitat loss and changes in land management practices. Monitoring and protection of suitable habitats are essential for the long-term survival of this species.",
