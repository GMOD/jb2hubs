  "description": "Leptidea sinapis, commonly known as the wood white or small white, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Pieridae. It is a small to medium-sized butterfly, with a wingspan of around 40-50 millimeters.\n\nThe upper surface of the wings is white, with the forewings having a characteristic dark tip. The underside of the wings is pale greenish-white, with faint veins and a small discal spot on the hindwings.\n\nLeptidea sinapis is found throughout Europe, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean region, and eastward to central Asia. It is typically found in woodlands, meadows, and other open, grassy habitats.\n\nThe species has a single generation per year, with adults emerging in late spring or early summer. The females lay their eggs singly on the leaves of host plants, which include various legumes such as Lathyrus and Vicia species.\n\nThe larvae, or caterpillars, are green in color and feed on the leaves of the host plants. They undergo several molts before pupating, and the pupa, or chrysalis, is typically attached to a stem or leaf.\n\nLeptidea sinapis is considered a relatively common and widespread species, though it may be declining in some areas due to habitat loss and changes in land use practices.",
