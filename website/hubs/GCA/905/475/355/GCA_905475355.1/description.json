  "description": "Clostera curtula, commonly known as the chocolate-tip or alder kitten, is a species of moth belonging to the family Notodontidae. It is found in Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nThe adult moth has a wingspan of around 30-35 millimeters. The forewings are brown with a distinctive chocolate-colored tip, which gives the moth its common name. The hindwings are greyish-white. The larvae (caterpillars) are typically green with yellow and black markings, and possess a distinct horn-like projection on the rear end.\n\nClostera curtula larvae feed primarily on the leaves of alder trees, but can also be found on other deciduous trees such as birch and willow. The moths are nocturnal and attracted to light sources. They typically fly from May to August, with the larvae appearing from June to September.\n\nThis species is not considered to be of major economic importance, but it can occasionally become a minor pest in areas where alder trees are cultivated. Overall, Clostera curtula is a fairly common and widely distributed moth species within its natural range.",
