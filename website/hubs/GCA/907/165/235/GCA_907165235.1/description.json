  "description": "Zeuzera pyrina, commonly known as the leopard moth or wood leopard moth, is a species of moth belonging to the family Cossidae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor.\n\nThe leopard moth is a medium-sized moth, with a wingspan of around 50-80 mm. The forewings are white with characteristic black spots, resembling the pattern of a leopard's fur, hence the common name. The hindwings are white or greyish-white.\n\nThe larvae of the leopard moth are wood-boring and feed on the inner bark and cambium of various broadleaf trees, such as apple, pear, plum, oak, and lime. The larvae can cause significant damage to the host trees, particularly in orchards and plantations.\n\nThe lifecycle of the leopard moth involves an egg stage, followed by the wood-boring larval stage, and finally the adult moth stage. The adults are typically active during the summer months, where they can be seen flying at night around the host trees.\n\nThe leopard moth is considered a pest species in some regions due to its potential to cause economic damage to fruit trees and other woody plants. Management strategies often involve the use of pheromone traps to monitor and control the population levels of this species.",
