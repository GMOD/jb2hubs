  "description": "Idaea aversata, commonly known as the Mullein Wave, is a species of moth belonging to the family Idaeidae. It is a small- to medium-sized moth with a wingspan of approximately 20-25 millimeters.\n\nThe adult moths have greyish-brown wings with distinct wavy patterns, which give the species its common name. The hindwings are typically lighter in color than the forewings. The body is slender, and the antennae are thread-like.\n\nIdaea aversata is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The larvae, or caterpillars, are typically green or brown in color and feed on various herbaceous plants, including mullein, plantain, and other low-growing vegetation.\n\nThe species undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The larvae can be found during the spring and summer months, while the adult moths are typically observed from late spring to early autumn.\n\nIdaea aversata is a common and widespread species that plays a role in the local ecosystem as a pollinator and as a food source for various predators, such as birds and small mammals.",
