  "description": "Parapoynx stratiotata is a species of moth belonging to the family Crambidae. It is commonly known as the waterlily moth or waterlily leafworm moth.\n\nThis moth is found in Europe and Asia, typically inhabiting areas near freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The larvae of P. stratiotata are aquatic, living submerged in the water and feeding on the leaves and stems of aquatic plants, particularly waterlilies (Nymphaea) and water soldier (Stratiotes).\n\nThe adult moths have a wingspan of approximately 20-25 millimeters. They have greyish-brown forewings with distinctive dark brown patches and markings, while the hindwings are white with dark veins. The larvae are greenish-brown in color and can grow up to 20 millimeters in length.\n\nParapoynx stratiotata is considered an important biological control agent for aquatic weeds, as the larvae can significantly reduce the growth and spread of certain invasive aquatic plant species. The species is also of ecological importance, as it serves as a food source for various predators in aquatic ecosystems.",
