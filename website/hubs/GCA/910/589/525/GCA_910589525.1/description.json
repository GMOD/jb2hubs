  "description": "Ennomos quercinarius, commonly known as the oak beauty, is a species of moth belonging to the family Ennominae. It is found in Europe, primarily in oak-dominated forests and woodlands.\n\nThe oak beauty has a wingspan of around 40-50 millimeters. The forewings are typically yellowish-brown with darker markings, often resembling the bark of oak trees, which helps the moth camouflage itself when resting. The hindwings are paler in color.\n\nThe larvae, or caterpillars, of the oak beauty feed on the leaves of various oak species (Quercus spp.). They are typically green in color with darker markings and can grow up to 50 millimeters in length. The caterpillars use their specialized adaptations, such as their body shape and coloration, to blend in with the oak foliage and avoid predation.\n\nThe oak beauty has a life cycle that involves overwintering as a pupa, with the adult moths emerging in late summer or early autumn. They play an important role in the oak-dominated ecosystems, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of these habitats.",
