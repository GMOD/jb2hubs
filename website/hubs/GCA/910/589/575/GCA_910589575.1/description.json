  "description": "Carcina quercana is a species of moth belonging to the family Depressariidae. It is commonly known as the Oak Flat-body Moth or Oak Flat-body.\n\nThis moth species is found in various parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, where its primary host plant is the oak tree (Quercus spp.).\n\nCarcina quercana has a wingspan of approximately 18-25 millimeters. The forewings are typically light brown or greyish-brown in color, with indistinct patterns or markings. The hindwings are pale grey or whitish.\n\nThe larvae of C. quercana feed on the leaves of oak trees, consuming the foliage during the spring and early summer months. The larvae are typically green or yellowish-green in color, with a darker head capsule.\n\nThis species is considered a minor pest in some areas, as the larvae can sometimes cause defoliation of oak trees, although the overall impact is generally not considered significant.\n\nCarcina quercana is an integral part of the oak tree ecosystem, contributing to the overall biodiversity and functioning of the forest habitat.",
