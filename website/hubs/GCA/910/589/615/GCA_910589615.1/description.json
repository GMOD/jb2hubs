  "description": "Taurulus bubalis, commonly known as the shorthorn sculpin or father-lasher, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Cottidae. This benthic species is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea, typically inhabiting coastal waters and estuaries.\n\nThe Taurulus bubalis has a distinctive, broad, and flattened head, with two pairs of short, blunt spines on the operculum (gill cover). The body is robust and covered with rough, bony plates, giving it a characteristic armored appearance. This species can grow up to approximately 25 centimeters in length and is typically brown, grey, or reddish-brown in color, often with darker mottled patterns that help it blend in with its benthic environment.\n\nThe shorthorn sculpin is a predatory species, feeding primarily on small fish, crustaceans, and other invertebrates found in its habitat. It is known for its ability to bury itself in the substrate, making it well-adapted to its coastal and estuarine environments. This species plays a role in the local ecosystem as both a predator and a prey item for larger predatory fish and seabirds.",
