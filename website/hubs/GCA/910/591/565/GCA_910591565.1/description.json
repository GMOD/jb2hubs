  "description": "Cydia splendana is a species of moth belonging to the family Tortricidae, commonly known as the chestnut moth or the chestnut seed moth. It is a small, grayish-brown moth with distinctive wing patterns that help it blend in with the bark and foliage of its host plants.\n\nThe larvae of C. splendana feed on the seeds and nuts of chestnut trees (Castanea spp.), including the European chestnut (Castanea sativa) and the American chestnut (Castanea dentata). The larvae bore into the developing nuts, causing significant damage to the crop and potentially affecting the yield and quality of the chestnut harvest.\n\nC. splendana has a widespread distribution, being found in Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is considered an important pest species in areas where chestnut cultivation is economically significant, and its management often involves the use of integrated pest management strategies, such as the application of pheromone traps and the use of biological control agents.",
