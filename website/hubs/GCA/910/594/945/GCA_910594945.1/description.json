  "description": "Amphipyra berbera, commonly known as the Svensson's Copper Underwing, is a species of moth belonging to the family Amphipyridae. This species is found in Europe, primarily in central and northern regions.\n\nMorphologically, Amphipyra berbera is a medium-sized moth with a wingspan ranging from 35 to 45 millimeters. The forewings are typically dark brown or greyish-brown in color, while the hindwings are a distinctive copper or reddish-brown hue. The species can be distinguished from its closely related counterparts by the presence of a characteristic dark band near the outer edge of the hindwings.\n\nThe larvae of Amphipyra berbera are known to feed on a variety of deciduous trees and shrubs, including oak, birch, and hazel. The moth itself is generally active at night, attracted to light sources, and can be observed during the summer and autumn months.\n\nAmphipyra berbera is considered a relatively common species within its geographical range, though its populations may be affected by factors such as habitat loss and changes in land use practices. Conservation efforts aimed at maintaining suitable habitats for this moth species can contribute to its continued presence in the ecosystem.",
