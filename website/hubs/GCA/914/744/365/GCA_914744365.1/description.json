  "description": "Thunnus albacares, commonly known as the yellowfin tuna, is a species of tuna found in the tropical and subtropical oceans of the world. It is a large, fast-swimming fish that can reach up to 2 meters in length and weigh over 200 kilograms.\n\nYellowfin tuna have a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with a distinctive bright yellow dorsal and anal fins, which can be used to differentiate them from other tuna species. They have a dark metallic blue back that fades to a silvery-white belly, and their bodies are covered in small, rough scales.\n\nThese tuna are apex predators, feeding primarily on smaller fish, squid, and crustaceans. They are known for their impressive migratory patterns, often traveling long distances in search of food and spawning grounds.\n\nYellowfin tuna are commercially important, with their meat being highly sought after for sushi, sashimi, and other culinary applications. However, due to their popularity and overfishing, their populations have declined in recent years, leading to conservation efforts to ensure the sustainability of this species.",
