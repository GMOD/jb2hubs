  "description": "Aplidium turbinatum is a species of sea squirt, also known as a colonial ascidian, that belongs to the family Polyclinidae. It is a sessile marine invertebrate that lives attached to various substrates, such as rocks, shells, or other marine surfaces, in coastal and shallow subtidal environments.\n\nAplidium turbinatum forms compact, leathery colonies that can range in color from white to yellow, orange, or even reddish-brown. The colonies typically have a characteristic turbinate or top-shaped appearance, with a narrower base and a broader, flattened upper surface. The individual zooids, or individual filter-feeding units that make up the colony, are small and embedded within the tunic, the tough, gelatinous outer layer of the colony.\n\nEach zooid in the colony has a branchial sac, or pharynx, with numerous stigmata (gill slits) that allow water to be drawn in and filtered for food particles, as well as a digestive system and reproductive organs. The colonies of Aplidium turbinatum can grow to several centimeters in diameter and are often found in dense aggregations on rocky substrates, where they contribute to the overall biodiversity of the benthic marine communities.",
