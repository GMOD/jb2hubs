  "description": "Ascidia mentula is a species of sea squirt, also known as a solitary tunicate, that belongs to the phylum Chordata and the class Ascidiacea. It is a sessile, marine invertebrate that is commonly found attached to rocky substrates or other hard surfaces in coastal waters.\n\nAscidia mentula has a distinctive, barrel-shaped body with a tough, leathery tunic or mantle that protects the internal organs. The tunic is typically reddish-brown or greyish in color and may have a wrinkled or uneven surface. The animal has two siphons, one for the intake of water and the other for the expulsion of waste and filtered water.\n\nAs a filter-feeding organism, Ascidia mentula draws in water through the incurrent siphon, where it traps and filters out suspended particles, such as plankton and detritus, using a specialized feeding structure called the branchial basket. The filtered water is then expelled through the excurrent siphon.\n\nAscidia mentula is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, typically in areas with moderate water movement and good water quality. It plays a role in the benthic ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the marine environment.",
