  "description": "Symphodus melops, also known as the corkwing wrasse, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Labridae. It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea, and can be found in coastal waters, usually in rocky or seagrass habitats.\n\nThe corkwing wrasse is a small, colorful fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 20 centimeters. It has a compressed, oblong body shape and a protruding lower jaw. The coloration of the fish can vary, but it is generally greenish-brown or reddish-brown, with distinctive blue and orange markings on the head and fins.\n\nSymphodus melops is a carnivorous species, feeding primarily on small invertebrates, such as crustaceans and mollusks, as well as small fish. It is known to be a protandric hermaphrodite, meaning it can change sex from male to female during its lifetime.\n\nThe corkwing wrasse plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to the overall diversity and balance of the marine ecosystem. It is also a popular target for recreational anglers and has commercial value in some regions.",
