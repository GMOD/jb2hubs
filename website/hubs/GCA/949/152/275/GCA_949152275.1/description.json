  "description": "Phoxinus phoxinus, commonly known as the European minnow or common minnow, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is widely distributed across Europe, extending from the British Isles to central Russia and from Scandinavia to northern Italy.\n\nThe European minnow is a small, slender fish typically reaching a maximum length of around 10 centimeters (4 inches). Its body is elongated and slightly compressed laterally, with a pointed snout and a terminal mouth. The dorsal and ventral fins are relatively small, and the caudal fin is forked. The coloration of the fish varies, with the back being greenish-brown or olive-brown, the sides silvery, and the fins often having a reddish tinge.\n\nPhoxinus phoxinus is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a variety of aquatic invertebrates, algae, and plant matter. It plays an important role in the food web, serving as a prey item for larger predatory fish, birds, and other aquatic predators.\n\nThe species is known for its schooling behavior, often forming large shoals in slow-moving or still waters, such as streams, rivers, and lakes. It prefers habitats with clean, well-oxygenated water and a substrate of gravel, sand, or submerged vegetation.\n\nPhoxinus phoxinus is considered a common and widespread species throughout its range, and it is not currently listed as threatened or endangered. However, it may face threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species that can compete with or prey upon the European minnow.",
