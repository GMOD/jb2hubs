  "description": "Platichthys flesus, commonly known as the European flounder or simply the flounder, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is a bottom-dwelling fish found in coastal waters and estuaries throughout the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe European flounder is characterized by its flat, oval-shaped body with both eyes situated on the right side of the head. Its upper side, which is the right side, is typically brown or olive-green in color, while the underside is white. This coloration pattern helps the fish camouflage itself against the seafloor.\n\nThese fish are typically found at depths ranging from a few meters to around 200 meters and prefer habitats with sandy or muddy substrates. They are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and fish.\n\nPlatichthys flesus is an important commercial and recreational species in many parts of its range, and it is also used in aquaculture and for research purposes. The species is known to be relatively resilient to environmental stressors, such as changes in water temperature and salinity, making it an important indicator of the health of coastal ecosystems.",
