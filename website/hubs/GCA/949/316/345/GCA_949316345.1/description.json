  "description": "Pungitius pungitius, commonly known as the ten-spined stickleback or Eurasian ninespine stickleback, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the family Gasterosteidae. It is widely distributed across the northern parts of Europe and Asia, inhabiting a variety of aquatic habitats, including lakes, rivers, and coastal areas.\n\nThe ten-spined stickleback is a small fish, typically measuring between 4 to 8 centimeters in length. It is characterized by its elongated, laterally compressed body and the presence of nine to eleven sharp, bony spines along its back, which can be raised as a defense mechanism against predators. The fish's coloration varies from olive-green to brown, with a lighter belly and darker vertical bars or spots along its sides.\n\nThe ten-spined stickleback is an opportunistic feeder, consuming a variety of small invertebrates, such as insect larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. It plays an important role in aquatic food webs, serving as a prey item for larger predatory fish, birds, and other vertebrates.\n\nReproduction in the ten-spined stickleback is characterized by elaborate courtship rituals and nest-building behavior by the male fish. The male constructs a small, dome-shaped nest using plant materials and defends it vigorously against intruders. Females deposit their eggs within the nest, which are then fertilized by the male. The male subsequently guards the nest and cares for the developing embryos until they hatch.\n\nThe ten-spined stickleback is considered a relatively widespread and adaptable species, with populations found in both freshwater and brackish environments. However, it may be threatened by habitat degradation, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species in some regions.",
