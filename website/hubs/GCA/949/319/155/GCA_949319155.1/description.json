  "description": "Squalius cephalus, commonly known as the chub, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to Europe, found in various river systems and lakes across the continent.\n\nThe chub is a medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of 30-50 cm. It has a robust, stocky body with a large, rounded head and a terminal mouth. The scales are large and cover the entire body, with a distinctive lateral line running along the sides. The coloration of the chub varies, ranging from olive-green to brown on the back, with silvery-white sides and a white or yellowish belly.\n\nChubs are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, insects, crustaceans, and small fish. They are known to be opportunistic feeders, adapting their diet to the available food sources in their habitat.\n\nReproduction in the chub occurs during the spring and early summer months. Females lay their eggs, which adhere to the substrate, such as rocks, gravel, or aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch after a few days, and the young chub undergo a larval stage before transitioning to a juvenile and eventually adult form.\n\nSqualius cephalus is an important species in freshwater ecosystems, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the aquatic environment. It is also valued by anglers as a popular target for recreational fishing.",
