  "description": "Hyperoplus immaculatus is a species of fish belonging to the family Ammodytidae, commonly known as the immaculate sand lance. It is a small, slender fish found in the coastal waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, including the waters around Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East.\n\nThe Hyperoplus immaculatus is characterized by its elongated, eel-like body, with a streamlined shape that helps it swim efficiently through the water. It has no scales, and its skin is smooth and uniform in color, lacking the distinctive patterns or markings seen in some other sand lance species.\n\nThis species typically grows to a length of around 15-25 centimeters and feeds primarily on small crustaceans, plankton, and other small marine organisms. Hyperoplus immaculatus plays an important role in the local marine ecosystems, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nThe species is generally considered to be of least concern in terms of conservation status, as its populations are relatively stable and widespread throughout its natural range. However, it may face some threats from human activities, such as coastal development, pollution, and overfishing, which can impact its habitat and food sources.",
