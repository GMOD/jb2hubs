  "description": "Phalacrocorax aristotelis, commonly known as the European shag or the common shag, is a species of cormorant that is native to the coasts of Europe. It is a member of the family Phalacrocoracidae, which includes various species of cormorants and shags.\n\nThe European shag is a medium-sized seabird, typically measuring between 65-80 cm in length and weighing around 1.5-2.5 kg. It has a slender, elongated body and a long, hooked bill that is adapted for catching and consuming fish. The plumage of the adult bird is dark green or bronze-colored, with a metallic sheen, and it has a distinctive crest on the top of its head during the breeding season.\n\nThese birds are highly adapted to a marine environment, with their webbed feet and streamlined bodies making them excellent swimmers and divers. They typically forage for small fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic prey by diving from the water's surface and pursuing their targets underwater.\n\nThe European shag is found primarily along the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, where it nests in colonies on rocky cliffs and islands. Its breeding season typically occurs between April and July, during which time the birds engage in complex courtship rituals and construct nests made of seaweed, sticks, and other materials.\n\nOverall, the European shag is an important component of the coastal ecosystems in which it resides, playing a crucial role in the food web and serving as a indicator of the health of the marine environment.",
