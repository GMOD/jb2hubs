  "description": "Ammodytes marinus, commonly known as the Lesser Sandeel or Raitt's Sandeel, is a small, slender fish species belonging to the family Ammodytidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to Norway and the Barents Sea.\n\nThe Ammodytes marinus is a streamlined, eel-like fish that can burrow into the sandy seabed, where it spends much of its time. It has a small, protruding lower jaw and a long, cylindrical body with a small dorsal fin and a deeply forked tail. The species is typically silver-gray in color, with a greenish or bluish tinge on the back.\n\nAmmodytes marinus feeds primarily on plankton, including small crustaceans and larval fish. It is an important prey species for various predators, such as seabirds, marine mammals, and larger fish. The species plays a crucial role in the marine food web, acting as a link between the lower and higher trophic levels.\n\nAmmodytes marinus is known to form large, dense schools, often found in shallow coastal waters and near offshore islands. The species is commercially important, with fisheries targeting it for bait and as a food source for aquaculture.",
