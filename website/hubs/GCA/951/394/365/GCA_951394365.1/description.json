  "description": "Tetrao urogallus, commonly known as the Eurasian capercaillie or wood grouse, is a large, ground-dwelling bird species belonging to the family Phasianidae. The species is native to the coniferous and mixed forests of Europe and Asia, ranging from Scandinavia to Siberia.\n\nThe Eurasian capercaillie is a distinctive bird characterized by its large size, with males weighing up to 7 kilograms and females around 2.5 kilograms. The male has a dark, iridescent plumage with a distinctive reddish-orange wattle above the eye, while the female has a more mottled brown and grey plumage. The species is known for its elaborate courtship displays, which involve the male inflating its wattle and producing a distinctive, far-carrying call to attract females.\n\nCapercaillies are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, including pine needles, berries, and other vegetation found in their forest habitats. They are important ecosystem engineers, playing a role in seed dispersal and the maintenance of forest health. However, the species is vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and disturbance, and is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
