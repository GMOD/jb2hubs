  "description": "Stenella coeruleoalba, commonly known as the striped dolphin, is a species of oceanic dolphin found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. It belongs to the family Delphinidae and the genus Stenella.\n\nThe striped dolphin is characterized by its distinctive coloration pattern, which includes a dark gray back, light gray sides, and a white ventral area. Its most notable feature is the presence of thin, dark stripes that run from the eyes to the flippers and from the eyes to the tail. These striking markings, along with its relatively slender body shape, make the striped dolphin easily recognizable.\n\nStriped dolphins are social animals, often found in large pods ranging from a few individuals to several hundred. They are known for their acrobatic and active behavior, frequently leaping out of the water and performing other aerial displays. Their diet consists primarily of small to medium-sized fish, squid, and crustaceans.\n\nStenella coeruleoalba is considered a cosmopolitan species, with a wide distribution across the world's oceans. However, some populations may be threatened by factors such as bycatch in fisheries, pollution, and habitat degradation. Conservation efforts, including monitoring and protection measures, are essential for the long-term survival of this charismatic marine mammal.",
