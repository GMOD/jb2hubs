  "description": "Argentina silus, commonly known as the greater Argentine, is a species of small marine fish belonging to the family Argentinidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Norway to the Canary Islands, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe greater Argentine is a slender, elongated fish with a silvery-blue coloration on its upper body and sides, and a white or silvery-white underside. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 40 cm (16 inches). The fish has a small, slightly upturned mouth, and its body is covered with small, smooth scales.\n\nArgentina silus is a pelagic species, meaning it inhabits the open ocean waters. It feeds primarily on small crustaceans, such as shrimp and krill, as well as small fish. The greater Argentine is an important prey item for larger predatory fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nThis species is commercially valuable and is caught for human consumption, particularly in Europe. It is often used in the production of fish meal and oil. Argentina silus is also an important component of the marine ecosystem, playing a role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the ocean.",
