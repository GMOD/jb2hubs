It is considered a hardy and resilient species, capable of withstanding environmental changes and disturbances.\n\nRutilus rutilus is of commercial and recreational importance, as it is a common target for anglers and is also harvested for human consumption in some regions. It is considered a valuable component of many freshwater ecosystems and is an important part of the aquatic biodiversity in its native range.",
