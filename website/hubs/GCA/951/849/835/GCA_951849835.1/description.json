It is a member of the family Cervidae and the genus Capreolus.\n\nThe European roe deer is a medium-sized cervid, typically standing around 65-85 cm at the shoulder and weighing between 20-30 kg. It has a slender, graceful build with a reddish-brown coat that changes to a greyish-brown in the winter. The species is characterized by its distinctive white rump patch and short, spike-like antlers in the male individuals.\n\nRoe deer are primarily browsers, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including leaves, shoots, buds, and fruits. They are known for their agility and ability to navigate through dense vegetation, often using their excellent hearing and vision to detect predators.\n\nThe species is widely distributed across Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia and from the British Isles to the Ural Mountains. They thrive in a variety of habitats, including deciduous and mixed forests, scrublands, and agricultural areas.\n\nRoe deer play an important ecological role, serving as a prey species for larger carnivores and contributing to the dispersal of plant seeds. They are also of significant cultural and economic importance, being a popular game species in many European countries.",
