  "description": "Zeus faber, commonly known as the John Dory or St. Peter's fish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Zeidae. It is found in the coastal waters of the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe John Dory is a distinctive-looking fish, characterized by its laterally compressed, disc-like body and large, round eyes. Its body is typically yellow or olive-green in color, with a dark spot on the side of its body, which is believed to resemble the thumb print of St. Peter, hence the alternative name \"St. Peter's fish.\"\n\nThe John Dory is a predatory fish, feeding primarily on smaller fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It uses its unique body shape and camouflage to stalk and ambush its prey, often surprising them with a sudden burst of speed.\n\nThe John Dory is a commercially important fish, prized for its delicate, sweet-tasting flesh. It is often served in fine dining establishments and is considered a delicacy in many regions.",
