  "description": "Nesoenas mayeri, commonly known as the Mauritius pink pigeon, is a species of bird native to the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It is a member of the dove and pigeon family, Columbidae.\n\nThe Mauritius pink pigeon is a medium-sized bird with a robust build. It has a distinctive pinkish-red plumage, which gives it its common name. The bird's head, neck, and upper breast are a deeper shade of pink, while the wings and back are a lighter pinkish-grey. Its bill is short and black, and its eyes are dark.\n\nThe species is primarily arboreal, spending most of its time in the canopy of the native Mauritian forests. It feeds on a variety of fruits, seeds, and berries. The Mauritius pink pigeon is known for its unique courtship displays, which involve elaborate head-bowing and wing-flapping.\n\nOnce considered critically endangered, the Mauritius pink pigeon has been the subject of intensive conservation efforts, which have helped to increase its population in recent decades. However, it remains vulnerable to threats such as habitat loss and introduced predators.",
