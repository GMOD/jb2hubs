  "description": "Carassius carassius, commonly known as the Prussian carp or crucian carp, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to Europe and Asia, and has been widely introduced to other regions as well.\n\nCarassius carassius is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching lengths of up to 30 cm (12 inches). It has a robust, laterally compressed body with a rounded, blunt snout. The fish's coloration can vary, with shades of yellow, green, or brown predominating, often with a reddish or golden hue on the fins.\n\nThe Prussian carp is known for its ability to survive in low-oxygen environments, such as stagnant ponds and heavily vegetated waters. This is achieved through its adaptation to utilize anaerobic respiration, which allows the fish to extract oxygen from the water even when oxygen levels are low.\n\nCarassius carassius is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, algae, and small invertebrates. It plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife.\n\nDue to its hardiness and adaptability, the Prussian carp has become an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native fish species and disrupt the local ecosystem. As a result, its introduction is often regulated or prohibited in certain areas.",
