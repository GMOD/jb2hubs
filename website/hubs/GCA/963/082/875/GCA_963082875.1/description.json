  "description": "Corella eumyota, commonly known as the sea squirt or sea vase, is a species of tunicate or ascidian marine invertebrate. It belongs to the phylum Chordata, class Ascidiacea, and order Aplousobranchia.\n\nThe Corella eumyota is a sessile, filter-feeding organism that attaches itself to various substrates in the marine environment, such as rocks, shells, or artificial structures. It has a sac-like body with two openings, called siphons, through which it draws in and expels water for feeding and respiration.\n\nThe body of Corella eumyota is typically translucent or white in color, and it can grow up to several centimeters in size. The species is known for its ability to reproduce both sexually, through the release of sperm and eggs, and asexually, through the formation of new individuals from fragmented body parts.\n\nCorella eumyota is found in various coastal regions around the world, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. It plays a role in the marine ecosystem as a filter feeder, contributing to the cycling of nutrients and the maintenance of water quality.",
