  "description": "Viscum album, commonly known as European mistletoe, is a semi-parasitic evergreen plant species belonging to the Santalaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found growing on the branches of various deciduous trees, such as apple, oak, and poplar.\n\nViscum album is a hemiparasite, meaning it obtains water and some nutrients from the host tree, while also photosynthesizing to produce its own food. The plant has a distinctive green, leathery, and dichotomously branched stem, with small, oval-shaped, yellowish-green leaves. It produces small, white, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for various bird species, which aid in the plant's dispersal.\n\nThe plant's leaves, stems, and berries contain a variety of biologically active compounds, including lectins, polyphenols, and viscotoxins, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties, particularly in the context of cancer treatment and management.",
