  "description": "Lipophrys pholis, commonly known as the shanny or common blenny, is a species of small, bottom-dwelling fish belonging to the family Blenniidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea.\n\nThe shanny is a relatively small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 15 cm (6 inches). It has a elongated, laterally compressed body with a large, rounded head and a prominent, protruding lower jaw. The fish is covered in small, smooth scales, and its coloration can vary from dark brown to greenish-grey, often with mottled or banded patterns that help it blend in with its rocky, intertidal habitat.\n\nShannies are known for their ability to move quickly and efficiently in and around rock crevices and tide pools, where they typically feed on small invertebrates such as crustaceans, mollusks, and algae. They are capable of breathing air and can even leave the water for short periods, making them well-adapted to the fluctuating environmental conditions of their coastal, intertidal environment.\n\nReproduction in the shanny involves the male establishing a territory and courting females, which then lay their eggs in a protected nest site, such as a rock crevice or an empty mussel shell. The male guards the eggs until they hatch, after which the young fry undergo a pelagic larval stage before settling to the seafloor and adopting the adult lifestyle.\n\nOverall, the shanny is a hardy, well-adapted fish that plays an important role in the ecology of rocky, intertidal ecosystems throughout its range.",
