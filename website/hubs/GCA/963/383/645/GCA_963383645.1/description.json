  "description": "Muscardinus avellanarius, commonly known as the common dormouse, is a small rodent species belonging to the family Gliridae. It is native to Europe and found in various woodland habitats, including deciduous forests, hedgerows, and scrublands.\n\nThe common dormouse is a small, round-bodied animal with a fluffy, golden-brown fur coat. It has large, dark eyes and a long, bushy tail that it uses for balance and as a counterweight during climbing. The species is known for its ability to enter a state of torpor, a form of deep sleep, during the colder months to conserve energy and survive periods of food scarcity.\n\nMuscardinus avellanarius is primarily arboreal, spending most of its time in the trees and shrubs, where it constructs nests made of woven plant materials. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of plant materials, such as nuts, berries, and insects.\n\nDue to habitat loss and fragmentation, the common dormouse is considered a protected species in many European countries. Conservation efforts are focused on maintaining and restoring suitable woodland habitats to ensure the long-term survival of this charismatic small mammal.",
