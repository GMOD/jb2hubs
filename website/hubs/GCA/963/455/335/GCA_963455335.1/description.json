  "description": "Martes martes, commonly known as the pine marten, is a small- to medium-sized mammal belonging to the family Mustelidae. It is a member of the genus Martes, which includes several species of tree-dwelling carnivores.\n\nThe pine marten is a slender and agile animal, with a long, cylindrical body, short legs, and a distinctive bushy tail. Its fur is typically a rich, reddish-brown color, with a creamy-yellow or white patch on its throat and chest. The species is primarily arboreal, spending a significant amount of time in the trees, where it hunts for a variety of prey, including small rodents, birds, insects, and berries.\n\nPine martens are known for their excellent climbing abilities and their ability to move stealthily through the forest canopy. They are solitary and territorial, using scent marking and vocalizations to communicate with conspecifics. Females typically give birth to a litter of 1-5 young, known as kits, which they care for and nurture until they are able to live independently.\n\nThe pine marten is found across Europe, from Scandinavia to the Iberian Peninsula, and is also present in parts of Asia. The species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, although it faces threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting in some regions.",
