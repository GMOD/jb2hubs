  "description": "Raja brachyura, commonly known as the blonde ray or short-nosed skate, is a species of ray belonging to the family Rajidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe blonde ray is characterized by a broad, flattened body with a short, rounded snout. Its upper surface is typically pale yellow or beige in color, giving it the common name \"blonde ray.\" The underside is white. It has a diamond-shaped disc and a relatively short, robust tail with a single row of small thorns along the midline.\n\nRaja brachyura is a bottom-dwelling species that prefers sandy or muddy habitats in coastal waters and continental shelf areas. It feeds primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. The blonde ray is ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the young are born live.\n\nThis species is commercially fished and valued for its meat. Due to overfishing and habitat degradation, the blonde ray is classified as \"Near Threatened\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, indicating that it faces a high risk of extinction in the medium-term future.",
