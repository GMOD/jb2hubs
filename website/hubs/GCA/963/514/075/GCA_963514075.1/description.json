  "description": "Conger conger, commonly known as the European conger or conger eel, is a species of large, predatory marine fish belonging to the family Congridae. It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles and Iceland to Mauritania, including the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe European conger is a long, cylindrical fish with a large, powerful head and jaw. It can grow up to 3 meters in length and weigh over 110 kg, making it one of the largest species of eel. The skin is dark brown or black in color, and the body is covered in small, embedded scales.\n\nConger conger is a voracious predator, feeding on a variety of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It is an ambush predator, hiding in crevices and waiting to ambush its prey. The species is known for its powerful bite and can deliver a painful bite to humans if handled.\n\nReproduction in the European conger involves a complex life cycle. They are believed to spawn in the open ocean, with the larvae (called leptocephali) drifting with ocean currents until they metamorphose into juvenile eels and migrate to coastal habitats. The species is commercially important, with the meat being highly valued in some regions.",
