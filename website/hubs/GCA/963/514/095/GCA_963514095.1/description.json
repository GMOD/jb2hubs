  "description": "Eutrigla gurnardus, commonly known as the grey gurnard, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Triglidae. The grey gurnard is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, inhabiting coastal and continental shelf waters.\n\nThe grey gurnard is characterized by a robust, elongated body with a large, bony head and three distinct spiny appendages on its pectoral fins, which it uses for locomotion and communication. The coloration of the fish can vary from greyish-brown to reddish-brown, with distinctive dark spots and bars along its body.\n\nThis species is primarily carnivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and small fish. Grey gurnards are known to exhibit unique behaviors, such as using their pectoral fins to \"walk\" along the seafloor and producing grunting sounds, which are believed to be used for communication and social interaction.\n\nGrey gurnards are commonly found at depths ranging from a few meters to around 200 meters and are an important component of the coastal marine ecosystems in their native range. They are often caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries and are also targeted by recreational anglers.",
