  "description": "Helleia helle, commonly known as the Lesser Marsh Fritillary, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is found in Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Asia.\n\nThe Lesser Marsh Fritillary has a wingspan of approximately 35-45 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is orange-brown with dark brown markings, while the underside is patterned with silvery-white spots and lines. The larvae feed on various species of violets (Viola spp.), which are the host plants for this butterfly.\n\nThe species is typically found in moist, meadow-like habitats, such as marshes, fens, and damp grasslands. It has a single generation per year, with adults typically flying from May to July. The females lay their eggs on the host plants, and the caterpillars hatch and feed on the leaves before entering a dormant stage over the winter, emerging as adults the following spring.\n\nThe Lesser Marsh Fritillary is considered a species of conservation concern in some parts of its range due to habitat loss and degradation. Efforts to preserve and restore suitable wetland and grassland habitats are important for the conservation of this butterfly species.",
