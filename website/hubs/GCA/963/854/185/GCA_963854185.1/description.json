  "description": "Sardina pilchardus, commonly known as the European pilchard or sardine, is a small, oily, pelagic fish species belonging to the family Clupeidae. It is native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to Senegal, and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe European pilchard is a slender, streamlined fish with a silvery-blue coloration on the back and silvery-white underside. It has a small, terminal mouth, a deeply forked tail, and a single dorsal fin. The species typically grows to a maximum length of around 20 centimeters (8 inches).\n\nSardina pilchardus is an important commercial fish, widely harvested for human consumption, as well as for use in fish meal and fish oil production. It plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems, serving as a key forage species for larger predatory fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nThe species exhibits seasonal migrations, moving into coastal waters to spawn, and then returning to offshore feeding grounds. Sardina pilchardus is known for its schooling behavior, often forming large, dense aggregations that are targeted by commercial fisheries.",
