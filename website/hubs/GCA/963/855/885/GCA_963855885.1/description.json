  "description": "Coenonympha glycerion, commonly known as the small heath, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is a small-sized butterfly, with a wingspan typically ranging from 30 to 40 millimeters.\n\nThe upperside of the wings is generally a pale brown or grayish-brown color, with a distinct dark brown or blackish spot near the tip of the forewing. The underside of the wings is typically paler, with a series of small, faint eyespots.\n\nCoenonympha glycerion is found across Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Asia. It prefers open, grassy habitats, such as meadows, pastures, and heathlands. The larvae of this species feed on various grasses, including Festuca and Poa species.\n\nThe life cycle of Coenonympha glycerion involves a single generation per year, with the adults typically flying from late spring to early autumn, depending on the geographic location. The species is known to exhibit seasonal polymorphism, with the spring and summer generations often differing in their appearance.\n\nCoenonympha glycerion is considered a common and widespread species, and it is not currently listed as a threatened species. However, like many other butterfly species, it can be affected by habitat loss and degradation due to changes in land use and management practices.",
