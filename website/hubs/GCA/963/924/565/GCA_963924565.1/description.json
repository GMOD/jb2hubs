  "description": "Ascidiella aspersa, commonly known as the rough sea squirt, is a species of solitary tunicate (sea squirt) found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is a sessile, filter-feeding marine invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Chordata, subphylum Tunicata.\n\nAscidiella aspersa is characterized by a barrel-shaped or cylindrical body that is usually grayish-green or brown in color. The outer surface of the body, or tunic, is rough and wrinkled, giving the species its common name. The tunic is composed of a tough, leathery material that provides protection and support for the organism.\n\nThe sea squirt has two siphons, or openings, on its body â€“ an incurrent siphon that draws in water and suspended food particles, and an excurrent siphon that expels the filtered water and waste. The water-pumping mechanism and feeding process in Ascidiella aspersa is typical of tunicates, with the incurrent siphon acting as a mouth and the excurrent siphon as an anus.\n\nAscidiella aspersa is widely distributed in coastal areas, often found attached to rocks, piers, or other hard substrates. It is an important component of the benthic community, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of the marine environment it inhabits.",
