  "description": "Micromys minutus, commonly known as the Eurasian harvest mouse, is a small rodent species belonging to the family Muridae. It is one of the smallest mammals found in Europe and Asia, with an average body length of around 5-7 centimeters and a weight of only 5-12 grams.\n\nThe Eurasian harvest mouse has a rounded body, a pointed snout, and a long, prehensile tail that is used for climbing and balance. Its fur is typically reddish-brown or orange-brown on the back, while the underside is white or pale grey. The species is known for its remarkable ability to climb and construct intricate nests made of woven grass, often suspended in tall vegetation.\n\nMicromys minutus is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and agricultural areas. It is primarily a nocturnal and solitary species, feeding on a diverse diet of seeds, grains, berries, and insects. The Eurasian harvest mouse plays an important role in the ecosystem as a prey species for various predators, such as owls, foxes, and weasels.\n\nDue to its small size and elusive nature, the Eurasian harvest mouse can be challenging to study, and its population dynamics are not fully understood. However, the species is not currently considered threatened and is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
