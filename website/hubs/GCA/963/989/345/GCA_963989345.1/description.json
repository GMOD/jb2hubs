  "description": "Clangula hyemalis, commonly known as the long-tailed duck, is a species of sea duck that belongs to the family Anatidae. It is a small to medium-sized duck, characterized by its distinctive long and pointed tail feathers, which can measure up to one-third of the bird's total length.\n\nThe long-tailed duck is widely distributed across the northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the Arctic tundra and coastal areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. During the non-breeding season, they migrate to more temperate coastal waters and open oceans, where they forage for a variety of aquatic invertebrates, such as mollusks, crustaceans, and small fish.\n\nThese ducks are known for their unique courtship displays, which involve elaborate head and neck movements, as well as their distinctive calls, which have been described as a \"musical, whistling 'aah-aah-ooo-oooh'\" sound.\n\nThe long-tailed duck is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although their populations have faced some declines in certain regions due to factors such as hunting, oil spills, and habitat loss.",
