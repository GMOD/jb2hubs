  "description": "Abramis brama, commonly known as the common bream or freshwater bream, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to Europe, primarily found in rivers, lakes, and slow-moving waters.\n\nThe common bream is a relatively large and deep-bodied fish, typically reaching lengths of 30-50 cm (12-20 inches) and weighing up to 3 kg (6.6 lbs). Its body is laterally compressed, with a small, downward-facing mouth and large, round scales. The dorsal fin is located midway along the body, and the tail fin is deeply forked.\n\nAbramis brama is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, small invertebrates, and some smaller fish. It is an important commercial and recreational fish in many parts of its range, particularly in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe common bream is known for its adaptability to different habitats and water conditions, tolerating a wide range of temperatures and oxygen levels. It is considered a hardy species, able to thrive in both lotic (flowing) and lentic (still) water environments.\n\nEcologically, the common bream plays a crucial role in aquatic food webs, serving as both a predator and prey species. It is an important component of many freshwater ecosystems, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem function.",
