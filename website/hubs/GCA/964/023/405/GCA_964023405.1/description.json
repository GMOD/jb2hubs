It is a small to medium-sized mouse with a distinctive black dorsal stripe running along its back from the head to the base of the tail.\n\nThe Apodemus agrarius is native to Asia, with a natural range extending from Eastern Europe to Japan. It is found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forests, and agricultural areas. The species is known for its adaptability and can thrive in both natural and human-modified environments.\n\nApodemus agrarius is primarily nocturnal and omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant matter, seeds, insects, and small invertebrates. It is an important prey species for various predators, such as birds of prey, snakes, and small carnivores.\n\nReproduction in the Apodemus agrarius is characterized by multiple litters per year, with the females giving birth to 4-8 young per litter. The young are born blind and helpless, and they mature rapidly, reaching sexual maturity within a few months.\n\nThe Apodemus agrarius is widely distributed and considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the species may face localized threats from habitat loss, fragmentation, and the use of rodenticides in agricultural areas.",
