  "description": "Micromesistius poutassou, commonly known as the blue whiting, is a small, slender fish species belonging to the family Gadidae. It is found in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, extending from the Barents Sea to the Iberian Peninsula, and in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe blue whiting is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical body shape and a distinct bluish-gray coloration on its back, fading to a silvery-white belly. It has a relatively large, slightly protruding lower jaw and a pair of small barbels on its chin. The fish typically grows to a maximum length of around 40 cm, with an average lifespan of about 10 years.\n\nBlue whiting are pelagic, schooling fish that primarily feed on small crustaceans, such as copepods and krill, as well as small fish and squid. They play an important role in the marine ecosystem as a forage species for larger predators, including commercially important fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.\n\nCommercially, the blue whiting is an important species in the Northeast Atlantic fisheries, where it is targeted for its meat and used in a variety of seafood products, such as surimi and fish meal.",
