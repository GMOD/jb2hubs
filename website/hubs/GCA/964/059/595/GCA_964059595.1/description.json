  "description": "Bucephala clangula, commonly known as the common goldeneye, is a species of duck belonging to the genus Bucephala. It is a medium-sized diving duck found in the Northern Hemisphere, primarily in North America and Eurasia.\n\nThe common goldeneye is characterized by its distinctive round, puffy head, and large, hooked bill. The male has a black head with a green iridescent sheen, a white body, and a yellow eye. The female has a brown head, gray body, and a white patch on the cheek. Both sexes have a white wing patch that is visible in flight.\n\nThese diving ducks primarily feed on aquatic insects, crustaceans, and small fish, which they catch by diving and swimming underwater. They are known for their loud, whistling call, which is often heard during their courtship displays.\n\nBucephala clangula is a migratory species, breeding in northern forested areas and wintering on open waters, such as lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. They are relatively abundant and have a widespread distribution, though their populations can be impacted by factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and climate change.",
