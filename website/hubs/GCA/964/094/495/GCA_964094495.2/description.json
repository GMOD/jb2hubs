It is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including forests, urban areas, and mountainous regions.\n\nThe whiskered bat is characterized by its distinctive facial features, including a prominent muzzle and long, silky whiskers, which give the species its common name.

The wingspan of the whiskered bat typically ranges from 22 to 26 centimeters.\n\nThis species is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of small insects such as moths, flies, and beetles. Myotis mystacinus is known for its agile flight and its ability to navigate through cluttered environments using echolocation, which it uses to detect and capture its prey.\n\nWhiskered bats are generally considered to be a common and widespread species, with stable populations in many parts of their range. However, they may face threats from habitat loss, disturbance of roost sites, and the use of certain pesticides, which can negatively impact their prey populations.",
