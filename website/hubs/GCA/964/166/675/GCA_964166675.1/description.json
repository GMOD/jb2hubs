  "description": "Cepaea nemorensis, also known as the Brown-lipped Snail or Grove Snail, is a species of land snail that belongs to the family Helicidae. It is a common and widespread species found throughout Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to Scandinavia and from the British Isles to the Urals.\n\nThe shell of Cepaea nemorensis is globular in shape, typically ranging from 18 to 25 millimeters in diameter. The shell color can vary greatly, from shades of yellow, brown, pink, or even banded patterns. The shell's surface is smooth and glossy, and the aperture (opening) of the shell has a distinct brown or reddish-brown lip.\n\nCepaea nemorensis is a herbivorous species, feeding on a variety of plants, including grasses, herbs, and decaying vegetation. It is often found in woodland habitats, gardens, and other areas with dense vegetation, where it can hide during the day and become more active at night or during periods of high humidity.\n\nThe species is known for its remarkable color polymorphism, which is believed to be an adaptation to various environmental conditions and predator pressures. This variation in shell color and banding patterns has made Cepaea nemorensis a popular subject of study in evolutionary biology and ecological research.",
