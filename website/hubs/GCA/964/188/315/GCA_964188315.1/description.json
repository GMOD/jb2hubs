  "description": "Podarcis muralis, commonly known as the common wall lizard or European wall lizard, is a species of small lizard native to Europe. It belongs to the genus Podarcis, which is part of the family Lacertidae.\n\nThe common wall lizard is a slender, medium-sized lizard, typically reaching a length of 15-20 cm, including the tail. It has a flattened body and a relatively large head. The coloration is variable, ranging from various shades of brown, gray, or green, with dark markings or stripes along the back and sides. Some individuals may also have a blue or orange-red coloration on the underside.\n\nThese lizards are primarily diurnal, meaning they are active during the day, and they can often be found basking on walls, rocks, or other warm surfaces. They are adept climbers and can quickly dart in and out of crevices and vegetation when threatened.\n\nThe common wall lizard is an oviparous species, meaning it reproduces by laying eggs. Females typically lay 2-10 eggs in sheltered locations, such as under rocks or in crevices, and the eggs hatch after several weeks of incubation.\n\nThe common wall lizard is a widespread and adaptable species, found throughout much of Europe, from the Iberian Peninsula to western Asia. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including urban areas, rocky landscapes, and Mediterranean scrublands.",
