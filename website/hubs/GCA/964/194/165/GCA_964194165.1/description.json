  "description": "Cetorhinus maximus, commonly known as the basking shark, is the second-largest living fish species in the world, after the whale shark. It is a member of the order Lamniformes and the family Cetorhinidae.\n\nBasking sharks are filter-feeding sharks, meaning they use their large mouths to capture and filter small prey from the water. They have a massive, gaping mouth that can measure up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) wide, equipped with small, numerous teeth used to filter plankton, small fish, and other small marine organisms.\n\nThese sharks are found in cool, temperate waters in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They are known to be slow-moving, docile, and harmless to humans. Basking sharks migrate long distances, often following the seasonal movements of their plankton prey.\n\nDespite their size, basking sharks are not aggressive and pose little threat to humans. They are, however, vulnerable to overfishing and other anthropogenic threats, leading to their classification as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
