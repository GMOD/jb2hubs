  "description": "Vipera berus, commonly known as the common European adder or common European viper, is a venomous snake species found across Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the genus Vipera, a group of venomous true vipers.\n\nThe Vipera berus is a relatively small snake, typically ranging from 50 to 70 cm in length. It has a distinct triangular-shaped head, vertical pupils, and a stocky, robust body. The coloration of the species can vary, with common color morphs including gray, brown, reddish-brown, and black, often with a distinct zig-zag pattern along the back.\n\nThis species is ectothermic, meaning it regulates its body temperature through external sources, such as basking in the sun. It is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, heathlands, moorlands, and grasslands, often in areas with good cover and basking sites.\n\nVipera berus is a viviparous species, meaning it gives birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The females can give birth to litters of 3 to 20 young, which are independent from birth. The species is known to be relatively slow-moving, but it can strike quickly and defensively when threatened.\n\nThe venom of Vipera berus is primarily hemotoxic, meaning it affects the circulatory system, and can cause swelling, pain, and sometimes more severe symptoms in humans. However, the risk of a fatal bite is relatively low, and the species is not considered a major threat to humans.",
