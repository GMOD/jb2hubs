  "description": "Scardinius erythrophthalmus, commonly known as the rudd, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the carp family, Cyprinidae. It is native to Europe and western Asia, inhabiting lakes, slow-moving rivers, and other still or slow-moving water bodies.\n\nThe rudd is a medium-sized fish, typically growing up to 40 cm in length. It has a deep, laterally compressed body with a blunt snout and a small, terminal mouth. The fins, including the dorsal, anal, and paired fins, are typically reddish or orange in color, giving the fish its distinctive appearance. The scales are large and easily visible, and the body color can range from greenish-brown to golden-yellow on the back, with silvery-white or pale yellow sides and belly.\n\nRudd are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, algae, small invertebrates, and even fish eggs and larvae. They are known to be hardy and adaptable fish, capable of thriving in a wide range of water conditions, including those with varying levels of oxygen, pH, and temperature.\n\nReproduction in the rudd typically occurs in the spring or early summer, with the fish spawning in shallow, vegetated areas of their habitat. The eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic plants or other submerged surfaces. The larvae and juveniles feed on plankton and small invertebrates, eventually transitioning to the more diverse adult diet.\n\nThe rudd is an important species in many freshwater ecosystems, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of its habitat.",
