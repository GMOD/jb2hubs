  "description": "Triturus cristatus, commonly known as the great crested newt, is a species of newt belonging to the family Salamandridae. It is one of the largest species of newt found in Europe, with adults typically reaching lengths of 10-15 cm.\n\nThe great crested newt is characterized by its distinct crest, which is more prominent in males during the breeding season. This crest is used for display and courtship rituals. The body is typically dark brown or black in color, with a pale belly and prominent warty skin.\n\nThese newts are primarily aquatic, spending the majority of their life cycle in ponds, lakes, or other freshwater habitats. They are skilled swimmers and use their long tails for propulsion. During the breeding season, the males perform intricate courtship dances to attract females, and the females lay their eggs on aquatic vegetation.\n\nThe great crested newt is considered a protected species in many European countries due to declining populations, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Conservation efforts focus on protecting and restoring suitable breeding and overwintering sites for this unique amphibian.",
