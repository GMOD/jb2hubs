  "description": "Styela clava, commonly known as the clubbed tunicate or Asian sea squirt, is a species of sea squirt or ascidian that belongs to the phylum Chordata and the class Ascidiacea. It is a sessile, filter-feeding marine invertebrate that attaches itself to various surfaces, such as rocks, docks, and ship hulls.\n\nThe Styela clava has a distinctive club-shaped body with a narrow stalk at the base, which gives it its common name. The body is covered by a tough, leathery tunic that can range in color from brown to gray. The animal has two siphons, one for intake and one for expelling water, which it uses to filter-feed on microscopic plankton and organic particles suspended in the water.\n\nStyela clava is native to the northwestern Pacific Ocean, including the coasts of China, Korea, and Japan. However, it has been introduced to various other regions, including the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and Europe, where it has become an invasive species, often outcompeting native ascidian species and disrupting local marine ecosystems.\n\nThe species is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, including changes in temperature, salinity, and levels of dissolved oxygen, which has contributed to its success as an invasive species. It is also capable of rapid growth and reproduction, with individuals able to reach sexual maturity within a few months and produce large numbers of larvae.",
