  "description": "Bombina variegata, commonly known as the yellow-bellied toad or fire-bellied toad, is a species of small amphibian belonging to the family Bombinatoridae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, with a range extending from Germany to Romania and Croatia.\n\nBombina variegata is a small toad, typically measuring between 3-5 cm in length. Its most distinctive feature is its vibrant yellow or orange-colored underbelly, which serves as a warning signal to potential predators. The upper side of the toad is typically brown or olive-green, with dark spots or markings.\n\nThe yellow-bellied toad is a semi-aquatic species, preferring to live in small, shallow ponds, wetlands, and slow-moving streams. It is a nocturnal species, spending much of the day hidden under rocks, logs, or vegetation, and emerging at night to feed on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and mollusks.\n\nBombina variegata is known for its unique defensive behavior, where it will flip over and expose its brightly colored belly when threatened, in an attempt to deter predators. This species also produces a defensive secretion from its skin that can be toxic to some predators.\n\nThe yellow-bellied toad is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but some local populations may be threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and the introduction of non-native species. Conservation efforts, such as habitat protection and management, are essential to ensure the long-term survival of this iconic European amphibian.",
