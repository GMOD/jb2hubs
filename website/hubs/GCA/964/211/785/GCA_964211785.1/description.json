It is a member of the genus Anser, which includes various goose species.\n\nThe Greylag Goose is characterized by its large size, with an average body length of around 75-90 cm and a wingspan of 150-180 cm. Its plumage is predominantly grey, with a pinkish-orange bill and legs. The species is known for its distinct honking call, which is often heard in flight or when the birds are congregating.\n\nGreylag Geese are widely distributed across Europe and Asia, with breeding populations found in temperate and subarctic regions. They prefer wetland habitats, such as marshes, lakes, and rivers, where they feed on a variety of aquatic plants, grasses, and grains.\n\nThese geese are highly social and often form large flocks, especially during the non-breeding season. They are known for their strong pair bonds and their ability to form strong family groups, with the parents and their offspring staying together for several years.\n\nGreylag Geese play an important role in their ecosystems, serving as a food source for predators and contributing to the maintenance of wetland habitats through their grazing and feeding activities.",
