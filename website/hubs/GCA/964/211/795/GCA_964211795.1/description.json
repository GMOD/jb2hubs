  "description": "Aythya ferina, commonly known as the common pochard or simply the pochard, is a medium-sized diving duck species belonging to the genus Aythya. It is native to Eurasia, breeding in temperate regions of Europe and Asia.\n\nThe common pochard is characterized by a distinctive reddish-brown head and neck, a black breast, and a grey body. It has a characteristic yellow eye and a dark bill. Females are generally duller in coloration, with a brown head and a grey body.\n\nThese ducks are primarily aquatic, spending most of their time on freshwater lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers. They are excellent divers, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, insects, and small invertebrates. During the breeding season, they form monogamous pairs and construct their nests in dense vegetation near the water's edge.\n\nThe common pochard is widely distributed across its range, with populations fluctuating due to various factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and climate change. Conservation efforts have been implemented in some regions to maintain the species' population and habitat.",
