  "description": "Mustelus asterias, commonly known as the starry smooth-hound or spotted houndshark, is a species of small, bottom-dwelling shark belonging to the family Triakidae. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to Mauritania, as well as in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe starry smooth-hound is characterized by its slender, streamlined body with a short, blunt snout and large, round eyes. Its skin is covered in small, denticle-like scales, which give it a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The coloration of this species is typically a grayish-brown or olive-gray on the dorsal (upper) side, with a white or pale underside and distinctive dark spots or \"stars\" scattered across its back and sides.\n\nThese sharks are known to feed primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks, which they crush with their flattened, pavement-like teeth. They are ovoviviparous, meaning they give birth to live young that hatch from eggs within the mother's body.\n\nMustelus asterias is considered a relatively common and widespread species, but it faces some conservation concerns due to its vulnerability to overfishing and habitat degradation. It is often caught as bycatch in commercial and recreational fisheries, and its meat and liver oil are sometimes utilized for human consumption or other purposes.",
