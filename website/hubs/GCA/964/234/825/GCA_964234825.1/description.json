  "description": "Podarcis melisellensis, commonly known as the Melisello wall lizard, is a species of lizard belonging to the family Lacertidae. It is endemic to the Croatian Adriatic islands of Lastovo, Mljet, and Vis.\n\nThis small lizard typically measures between 14-18 cm in total length, including the tail. Its body is slender with a pointed snout. The dorsal coloration can vary from shades of brown to gray, often with darker spots or stripes. The ventral side is usually whitish or yellowish.\n\nPodarcis melisellensis is a diurnal, insectivorous species that inhabits rocky areas, stone walls, and Mediterranean scrubland. It is an agile and fast-moving lizard that uses its camouflage to blend in with its surroundings. The species is known for its ability to lose its tail as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nReproduction in Podarcis melisellensis typically occurs during the spring and summer months. Females lay 2-5 eggs, which hatch after an incubation period of approximately 2 months. The young lizards reach sexual maturity within their first year of life.\n\nThis species is considered a vulnerable species due to its limited distribution and habitat fragmentation. Conservation efforts, such as the protection of its island habitats, are crucial for the long-term survival of Podarcis melisellensis.",
