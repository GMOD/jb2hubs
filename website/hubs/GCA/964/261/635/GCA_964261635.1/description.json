  "description": "Lissotriton helveticus, commonly known as the smooth newt, is a small amphibian species belonging to the family Salamandridae. It is native to western and central Europe, including countries such as France, Germany, Switzerland, and parts of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe smooth newt is a relatively small species, typically reaching a length of 8-12 centimeters. It has a slender body with a smooth, velvety skin that ranges in color from olive-green to brown, often with darker spots or markings. The tail is long and laterally compressed, which aids in its aquatic locomotion.\n\nDuring the breeding season, the male smooth newt develops a distinct crest along its back and a fan-like tail, which it uses to attract and court females. The females lay their eggs singly, attaching them to submerged aquatic vegetation.\n\nSmooth newts are typically found in various freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where they spend a significant portion of their life cycle. They are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and mollusks.\n\nThe smooth newt is considered a relatively common species throughout its range and is not currently listed as threatened or endangered. However, it faces threats from habitat loss, pollution, and the introduction of non-native predators, which can have a negative impact on local populations.",
