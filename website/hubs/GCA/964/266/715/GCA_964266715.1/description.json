  "description": "Microstomus kitt, commonly known as the lemon sole or the common sole, is a species of flatfish belonging to the family Pleuronectidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the British Isles to the Barents Sea, and also in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe lemon sole is a benthic fish, meaning it lives and feeds on the seafloor. It has a flattened, ovoid body shape, with both eyes situated on the upper, pigmented side of the body. The lower, unpigmented side is white in color. The lemon sole has a small mouth with small teeth, which it uses to feed on small invertebrates and crustaceans found in the sediment.\n\nMicrostomus kitt is a commercially important species, with the flesh being highly prized for its delicate flavor and texture. It is an important target species for commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. The species is known to be susceptible to overexploitation, and its populations are closely monitored and managed by fishery authorities.",
