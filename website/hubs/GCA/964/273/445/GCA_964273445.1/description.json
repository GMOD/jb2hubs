  "description": "Streptopelia decaocto, commonly known as the Eurasian collared dove, is a species of dove belonging to the genus Streptopelia. It is native to Asia, but has expanded its range significantly in the 20th century, colonizing much of Europe, Africa, and parts of North America.\n\nThe Eurasian collared dove is a medium-sized dove with a distinctive black half-collar on the back of its neck, which gives it its common name. It has a slender, streamlined body, a small head, and a relatively long, tapered tail. The plumage is predominantly pale grey, with a pinkish-buff breast and abdomen. Its flight is characterized by stiff, rapid wing beats.\n\nEcologically, the Eurasian collared dove is an adaptable species that thrives in a variety of habitats, including urban and suburban areas, agricultural landscapes, and woodlands. It feeds primarily on seeds, grains, and other plant matter. The species is known for its prolific breeding behavior, with multiple broods produced each year, which has contributed to its successful range expansion.\n\nDue to its adaptability and population growth, the Eurasian collared dove is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
