  "description": "Mesoplodon mirus, commonly known as the True's beaked whale, is a species of beaked whale belonging to the family Ziphiidae. These whales are classified as medium-sized cetaceans, with adult individuals typically measuring between 4.5 to 5.5 meters in length.\n\nThe distinctive features of M. mirus include a robust, barrel-shaped body, a short beak, and a small, triangular-shaped dorsal fin located towards the posterior end of the body. Their coloration varies from dark gray to black on the dorsal side, with a lighter, grayish-white underside.\n\nMesoplodon mirus are found in the temperate and subtropical waters of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, with a distribution that extends from the eastern coast of North America to the western coast of Africa. They are considered one of the least known members of the Mesoplodon genus, as their elusive nature and offshore habitats make them challenging to study.\n\nThe diet of True's beaked whales primarily consists of various species of cephalopods, such as squid and octopus, as well as small fish. They are believed to be suction feeders, using their unique dentition and specialized jaws to capture and consume their prey.\n\nConservation-wise, Mesoplodon mirus is classified as \"Data Deficient\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to the limited information available on their population status and potential threats. Ongoing research and monitoring efforts are essential to better understand the ecology and conservation needs of this enigmatic species of beaked whale.",
