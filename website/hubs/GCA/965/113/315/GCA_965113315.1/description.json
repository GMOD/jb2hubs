It is endemic to northern Africa, found primarily in Morocco and Algeria.\n\nPhysically, Podarcis vaucheri is a small to medium-sized lizard, typically reaching a snout-to-vent length of around 6-8 cm. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males being slightly larger than females. The dorsal coloration varies from brown to grayish-brown, with darker spots or reticulations. The ventral side is usually pale or whitish.\n\nPodarcis vaucheri is a diurnal, heliothermic (sun-basking) species that inhabits a variety of habitats, including rocky areas, stone walls, and open, dry environments. It is an agile and alert lizard, known for its ability to run and climb quickly to escape predators.\n\nThe species is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a range of invertebrates such as insects, spiders, and small arthropods. Reproduction in Podarcis vaucheri typically occurs during the spring and early summer, with females laying a clutch of 2-8 eggs.\n\nPodarcis vaucheri is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a relatively wide distribution and is not currently facing major threats. However, habitat degradation and fragmentation due to human activities may pose potential risks to the species in the future.",
