  "description": "Aythya marila, commonly known as the greater scaup or simply the scaup, is a species of diving duck that belongs to the genus Aythya. It is a medium-sized waterfowl found in the northern hemisphere, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nThe greater scaup is characterized by its distinctive appearance, with a rounded head, large bill, and a dark, iridescent green head that contrasts with its white body and black breast. The male and female birds exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the males being more colorful and having a larger bill compared to the females.\n\nThese ducks are primarily aquatic birds, spending most of their time on open water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. They feed mainly on aquatic invertebrates, small fish, and plant matter, diving underwater to forage. The greater scaup is known for its migratory behavior, with individuals breeding in the northern regions and wintering in more temperate areas.\n\nThe greater scaup is an important species in the ecosystem, contributing to the food web and serving as a prey for larger predators. It is also a popular target for recreational hunting and birdwatching, making it a significant component of the avian biodiversity in its native habitats.",
