  "description": "Cygnus columbianus, commonly known as the Tundra Swan or Whistling Swan, is a species of swan belonging to the genus Cygnus. It is a migratory waterfowl native to North America.\n\nDescription:\n- Cygnus columbianus is a large, elegant swan with a long, slender neck and a distinctive black bill with a yellow spot in front of the eye.\n- The plumage is entirely white, with black legs and feet.\n- The wingspan can reach up to 2.1 meters (7 feet), and the average body length is around 1.2 meters (4 feet).\n- The Tundra Swan is smaller than its close relative, the Trumpeter Swan (Cygnus buccinator), and can be distinguished by its smaller size and the yellow spot on the bill.\n\nHabitat and Distribution:\n- Cygnus columbianus breeds in the arctic and subarctic regions of North America, including Alaska and Canada.\n- During the non-breeding season, the species migrates to temperate regions of the United States and Canada, where it can be found in wetlands, lakes, and rivers.\n\nBehavior and Ecology:\n- Tundra Swans are primarily herbivorous, feeding on aquatic plants, grasses, and other vegetation.\n- They are known for their loud, high-pitched calls, which are often described as a \"whoop\" or \"whistle,\" hence the common name \"Whistling Swan.\"\n- Tundra Swans are monogamous and form long-lasting pair bonds. They build large, mound-like nests on the ground near water bodies.\n- The species is important ecologically, serving as a food source for predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the habitats they occupy.\n\nConservation Status:\n- Cygnus columbianus is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as the species has a large and stable global population.\n- However, the species faces some threats, such as habitat loss and degradation, hunting, and collisions with power lines and other infrastructure.",
