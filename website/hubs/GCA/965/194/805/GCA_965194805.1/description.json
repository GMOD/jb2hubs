  "description": "Balaenoptera borealis, commonly known as the sei whale, is a species of baleen whale that belongs to the family Balaenopteridae. It is the third-largest member of the rorqual group, after the blue whale and the fin whale.\n\nThe sei whale has a sleek, streamlined body, typically reaching lengths of 12-20 meters (39-66 feet) and weighing up to 28 metric tons (31 short tons). Its coloration is typically dark gray or bluish-gray on the back, with a lighter gray or white underside. The whale has a distinct, tall, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin located about two-thirds of the way back along its body.\n\nSei whales are found in temperate and subpolar ocean regions around the world, often in the open ocean. They are migratory animals, spending the summer feeding in high-latitude waters and the winter in low-latitude breeding and calving areas. Their diet consists primarily of small schooling fish, krill, and copepods, which they filter-feed using their baleen plates.\n\nThe sei whale is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to past commercial whaling, which greatly reduced its global population. Conservation efforts and international protection measures have helped the species recover in recent decades, but they remain vulnerable to threats such as ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and the potential impacts of climate change on their feeding grounds.",
