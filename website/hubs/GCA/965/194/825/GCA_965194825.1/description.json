  "description": "Balaenoptera physalus, commonly known as the fin whale, is the second-largest species of whale in the world, after the blue whale. It belongs to the order Cetacea, the suborder Mysticeti, and the family Balaenopteridae.\n\nFin whales are characterized by their streamlined, elongated bodies, which can reach lengths of up to 27 meters (88 feet) and weigh up to 120 metric tons. They have a distinctive coloration pattern, with a dark gray or brownish-black upper body and a white or pale underside. Their most distinctive feature is the asymmetrical coloration of their head, with the right side being lighter in color than the left.\n\nFin whales are found in all the world's major oceans, from the equator to the polar regions. They are primarily pelagic, spending most of their time in deep, open waters, and are known for their impressive speed, capable of reaching speeds of up to 37 kilometers per hour (23 miles per hour).\n\nThese whales are filter feeders, using their baleen plates to strain small schooling fish, krill, and other small marine organisms from the water. They are an important part of the marine ecosystem, playing a role in the food chain and serving as indicators of the overall health of the ocean.\n\nDue to historical overexploitation, fin whales were classified as an endangered species, but their populations have since recovered, and they are now listed as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
