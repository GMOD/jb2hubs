  "description": "Pagrus pagrus, also known as the common seabream or red porgy, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Sparidae. It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, as well as the western Atlantic Ocean, ranging from Massachusetts, USA, to Argentina.\n\nPagrus pagrus is a relatively large fish, typically reaching lengths of up to 60 cm (24 inches) and weighing up to 5 kg (11 pounds). It has a robust, ovate body with a large, terminal mouth and strong jaws, which are adapted for crushing hard-shelled prey such as mollusks and crustaceans. The fish's coloration is typically reddish-pink or silvery-grey, with dark vertical bars along the body.\n\nPagrus pagrus is a commercially important species, targeted by both recreational and commercial fisheries. It is valued for its firm, white flesh and is often sold fresh or frozen. The species is also important in aquaculture, with efforts to develop sustainable farming practices for this species.\n\nEcologically, Pagrus pagrus plays a significant role in coastal and offshore marine ecosystems, serving as both a predator and a prey species. It feeds on a variety of benthic organisms, contributing to the overall trophic structure of the ecosystem, while also being a food source for larger predatory fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.",
