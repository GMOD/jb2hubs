  "description": "Trypanosoma brucei brucei TREU927 is a subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, in humans and nagana in livestock. The TREU927 strain is a well-characterized laboratory isolate that has been widely used in research and genomic studies.\n\nT. b. brucei TREU927 is a unicellular, flagellated protozoan that belongs to the order Kinetoplastida. It has a complex life cycle, involving both a mammalian host and a tsetse fly vector. In the mammalian host, the parasite resides in the bloodstream and lymphatic system, where it undergoes antigenic variation to evade the host's immune response. This subspecies is not able to infect humans due to the presence of a specific human serum factor that kills the parasite, but it can infect various livestock animals, causing significant economic and agricultural impacts.\n\nThe TREU927 strain has been extensively studied for its genome, transcriptome, and proteome, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the parasite's biology, host-parasite interactions, and potential drug targets for the development of new therapies against African trypanosomiasis.",
