  "description": "Kluyveromyces lactis is a species of yeast that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic microorganism known for its ability to utilize lactose, the primary sugar found in milk, as a carbon and energy source.\n\nK. lactis is a haploid organism, meaning it has a single set of chromosomes. It reproduces asexually through budding, a process in which a new cell emerges from the parent cell. This yeast is commonly found in dairy environments, such as cheese production facilities and dairy farms, where it plays a role in the fermentation and ripening processes.\n\nOne of the key characteristics of K. lactis is its lactose metabolism. The yeast produces enzymes, including Î²-galactosidase, which allow it to break down lactose into glucose and galactose, which can then be further metabolized for energy production. This ability makes K. lactis useful in the dairy industry, where it can be employed in the production of certain cheese varieties and other dairy products.\n\nAdditionally, K. lactis has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of heterologous proteins, the development of expression systems, and the exploration of its genetic and metabolic properties for various industrial and scientific purposes.",
