  "description": "Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88 is a strain of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger, which is a widely studied and important species in the genus Aspergillus. Aspergillus niger is a common environmental mold known for its ability to produce a variety of industrially relevant enzymes and metabolites.\n\nThe CBS 513.88 strain is a well-characterized isolate of Aspergillus niger that has been extensively studied and used as a model organism in various research and industrial applications. This strain was originally isolated and deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection.\n\nAspergillus niger CBS 513.88 is a black-spored fungus that grows rapidly on various media, forming dense, velvety colonies. Microscopically, the fungus produces conidiophores (asexual reproductive structures) that bear chains of dark-colored, globose (spherical) conidia (asexual spores). This strain is known for its ability to produce a wide range of enzymes, such as glucoamylase, cellulases, and pectinases, which are important in various industrial processes, including the production of food, beverages, and biofuels.\n\nThe genome of Aspergillus niger CBS 513.88 has been sequenced and studied, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities, secondary metabolite production, and genetic regulation. This strain has been widely used as a model organism in the study of fungal biology, genetics, and biotechnological applications.",
