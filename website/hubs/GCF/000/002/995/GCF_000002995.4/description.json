  "description": "Brugia malayi is a species of filarial nematode, a type of parasitic roundworm, that is responsible for causing lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease. This mosquito-borne parasite is primarily found in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Malaysia, and India.\n\nThe adult B. malayi worms reside in the lymphatic system of the human host, where they can live for several years and produce thousands of microscopic larvae, known as microfilariae. These microfilariae circulate in the bloodstream and are taken up by mosquitoes during a blood meal, completing the parasite's life cycle.\n\nInfection with B. malayi can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including lymphedema, hydrocele, and elephantiasis, which are caused by the worms' impact on the lymphatic system. The disease is considered a major public health problem in affected regions, and efforts are ongoing to control and eliminate this parasite through mass drug administration and vector control strategies.",
