  "description": "Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL is a rodent malaria parasite species that belongs to the genus Plasmodium. It is a subspecies of Plasmodium yoelii, which is a common model organism used in malaria research.\n\nPlasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL is a protozoan parasite that infects and replicates within red blood cells of its rodent host, typically the laboratory mouse. The \"17XNL\" designation refers to a specific strain of the parasite that has been widely used in experimental studies.\n\nThis subspecies is known for its ability to cause acute and lethal infections in laboratory mice, making it a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis, host-parasite interactions, and potential therapeutic interventions of malaria. Researchers have utilized Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL to study various aspects of malaria, including host immune responses, drug testing, and the development of potential vaccines.\n\nThe life cycle of Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL is similar to other Plasmodium species, involving both sexual and asexual stages within the mosquito vector and the vertebrate host, respectively. The successful use of this model system has contributed to our understanding of the complex biology and epidemiology of malaria, which remains a significant global health challenge.",
