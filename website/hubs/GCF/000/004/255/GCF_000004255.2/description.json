  "description": "Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata is a perennial, herbaceous plant species that belongs to the mustard family, Brassicaceae. It is a close relative of the model organism, Arabidopsis thaliana, and is commonly known as the lyre-leaved rock cress.\n\nArabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata is native to North America, primarily found in the eastern and central regions of the United States and Canada. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained habitats, such as cliffs, ledges, and open woodlands.\n\nThe plant has a rosette-forming growth habit, with deeply lobed, lyre-shaped leaves that arise from the base of the plant. The leaves are typically green in color and covered with small, soft hairs. The flowers are white in color and have four petals, characteristic of the mustard family.\n\nArabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata is considered a valuable model organism for research in various fields, including plant genetics, evolutionary biology, and plant stress responses. Its genome has been sequenced, and it shares many similarities with the more extensively studied A. thaliana, making it a useful comparative system for understanding plant biology.\n\nOverall, Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. lyrata is a hardy, perennial plant species that has adapted to thrive in challenging, rocky environments and has proven to be a valuable research model in the scientific community.",
