  "description": "Glycine max, commonly known as the soybean or soya bean, is a species of legume native to East Asia. It is an annual herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Fabaceae. Glycine max is a widely cultivated crop plant, primarily grown for its edible bean, which is a valuable source of protein, oil, and other nutrients.\n\nThe soybean plant typically grows to a height of 20-150 cm, with trifoliate leaves and white, purple, or pink flowers. The pods contain one to five seeds, which are oval-shaped and range in color from yellow to black. Soybeans are rich in isoflavones, a group of phytoestrogens that have been studied for their potential health benefits.\n\nGlycine max is an important crop worldwide, with major producers including the United States, Brazil, Argentina, China, and India. Soybeans are used to produce a variety of food products, such as tofu, tempeh, miso, and soy milk, as well as animal feed and industrial products like biodiesel. The cultivation and processing of soybeans have significant economic and agricultural importance globally.",
