  "description": "Dictyostelium discoideum AX4 is a species of slime mold, a type of protist that exhibits both unicellular and multicellular stages in its life cycle. It is a model organism widely used in the study of cell biology, development, and social behavior.\n\nAX4 is a genetically modified strain of D. discoideum, which has been widely used in research due to its ability to grow axenically (in the absence of bacteria) and its well-characterized genome. The organism is a soil-dwelling eukaryote that feeds on bacteria and other microorganisms.\n\nDuring its life cycle, D. discoideum AX4 can transition from a single-celled amoeba to a multicellular, fruiting body structure. When food becomes scarce, the individual amoebae aggregate and form a multicellular slug-like structure, which can move towards better environmental conditions. This slug then develops into a fruiting body, consisting of a stalk and a spore-containing structure, which facilitates the dispersal of spores and the survival of the organism during unfavorable conditions.\n\nD. discoideum AX4 is a valuable model organism in the study of cellular signaling, chemotaxis, cell differentiation, and the evolution of multicellularity. Its simple life cycle, genetic tractability, and well-studied developmental processes make it an important tool for understanding fundamental biological processes.",
