  "description": "Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 is a well-studied strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli, a common inhabitant of the human gut microbiome. This particular strain was first isolated in 1922 from the stool of a diphtheria patient in Palo Alto, California, and has since become a widely used model organism in microbiology and molecular biology research.\n\nThe MG1655 strain is a non-pathogenic derivative of the original K-12 strain, and is known for its well-characterized genome and extensive genetic and physiological data available. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is facultatively anaerobic, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen.\n\nThe genome of E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 consists of a single circular chromosome of approximately 4.6 million base pairs, encoding around 4,300 protein-coding genes. This strain has been extensively used as a model organism to study various cellular processes, such as DNA replication, gene expression, metabolism, and stress response mechanisms.\n\nDue to its well-established genetic tools and ease of cultivation, E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 has become an invaluable tool for a wide range of research applications, including genetic engineering, metabolic engineering, and the study of host-microbe interactions.",
