  "description": "Plasmodium knowlesi strain H is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the Plasmodium genus, which is responsible for causing malaria in humans and other primates. Plasmodium knowlesi is a simian malaria parasite that can infect humans and is considered an emerging zoonotic disease.\n\nThe strain H of Plasmodium knowlesi was first isolated from a human patient in Malaysia in 2004. This strain is known to be highly virulent and can cause severe and potentially life-threatening malaria in humans, with clinical manifestations similar to those caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly human malaria parasite.\n\nGenetically, Plasmodium knowlesi strain H is closely related to other Plasmodium knowlesi strains found in various primate hosts, such as the long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) and the pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), which are the natural hosts for this parasite. The genome of Plasmodium knowlesi strain H has been sequenced, providing insights into its biology, pathogenicity, and potential drug targets.\n\nUnderstanding the characteristics and epidemiology of Plasmodium knowlesi strain H is crucial for the development of effective diagnostic tools, treatment strategies, and public health interventions to combat this emerging zoonotic malaria threat.",
