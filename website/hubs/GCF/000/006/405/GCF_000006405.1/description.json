  "description": "Perkinsus marinus ATCC 50983 is a species of unicellular eukaryotic parasite that belongs to the Perkinsozoa phylum. It is the causative agent of Dermo disease, a significant disease affecting the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States.\n\nThis species is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects the host's hemocytes (immune cells) and can proliferate within the oyster's tissues, leading to the development of the Dermo disease. P. marinus ATCC 50983 has a complex life cycle, with several distinct stages, including trophozoites, schizonts, and zoospores.\n\nThe ATCC 50983 strain of P. marinus was isolated from an infected Eastern oyster and is commonly used in research to study the biology, pathogenesis, and host-parasite interactions of this important aquaculture pathogen. Investigations into the genomics, biochemistry, and host-immune responses to P. marinus ATCC 50983 have contributed to a better understanding of this economically significant parasite.",
