  "description": "Rickettsia conorii str. Malish 7 is a species of gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia. It is the causative agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, also known as boutonneuse fever, which is a tick-borne rickettsial disease.\n\nThe Malish 7 strain of R. conorii was isolated from a patient in Yugoslavia (now Serbia) in 1954. It is a small, coccobacillary or rod-shaped bacterium that measures approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is highly adapted to survive and replicate within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells, particularly endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages.\n\nR. conorii str. Malish 7 is primarily transmitted by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and is found in Mediterranean countries, Africa, and parts of Asia. The infection in humans typically causes a characteristic skin rash, fever, and other clinical symptoms, and can be potentially life-threatening if not treated with appropriate antibiotics.\n\nGenetic and genomic studies have revealed that the Malish 7 strain is closely related to other R. conorii strains and shares a high degree of similarity in its genomic content and organization, reflecting the close evolutionary relationship within the species.",
