  "description": "Brucella suis 1330 is a Gram-negative, facultatively intracellular bacterial species that belongs to the genus Brucella. It is the causative agent of porcine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that can also infect humans. \n\nThe strain Brucella suis 1330 is a virulent and well-characterized isolate that is commonly used in research and diagnostic settings. It is a small, non-motile, and non-spore-forming coccobacillus. Brucella suis 1330 is capable of surviving and replicating within the host's phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, which allows it to evade the immune response.\n\nThe pathogenesis of Brucella suis involves its ability to invade and persist within the host's cells, leading to a chronic and debilitating infection. Infection in humans can result in a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and potentially more severe complications, such as endocarditis or neurobrucellosis.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and virulence factors of Brucella suis 1330 is crucial for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies against porcine brucellosis and human brucellosis, which remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.",
