  "description": "Bacillus anthracis str. 'Ames Ancestor' is a strain of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of the serious and often fatal disease, anthrax. This particular strain is the ancestral form of the Ames strain, which is one of the most widely studied and virulent strains of B. anthracis.\n\nBacillus anthracis is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Bacillaceae family. The Ames Ancestor strain is known to possess the two major virulence plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, which encode the key toxins and capsule that contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacterium.\n\nThis strain is commonly used in research and laboratory studies to understand the biology, genetics, and virulence mechanisms of B. anthracis. Its study has provided important insights into the development of medical countermeasures, such as vaccines and treatments, against anthrax infections.",
