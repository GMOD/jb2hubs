  "description": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. Sakai is a pathogenic strain of the bacterium Escherichia coli, which is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic bacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms, including humans.\n\nThe O157:H7 serotype of E. coli is known to be a major cause of foodborne illness, particularly due to its ability to produce Shiga toxin, a potent cytotoxin that can lead to severe gastrointestinal complications, such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).\n\nThe Sakai strain, named after the city in Japan where a large outbreak occurred in 1996, is a specific isolate of the O157:H7 serotype that has been extensively studied due to its virulence and ability to cause severe disease in humans. This strain is known to possess a variety of virulence factors, including genes encoding Shiga toxin, intimin (an adhesion protein), and a type III secretion system, which collectively contribute to its pathogenicity.\n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 str. Sakai is an important subject of research in microbiology, food safety, and public health, as understanding its genetic and molecular characteristics is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies against this potentially life-threatening foodborne pathogen.",
