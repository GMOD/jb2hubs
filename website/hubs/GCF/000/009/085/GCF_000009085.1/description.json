  "description": "Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 = ATCC 700819 is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, microaerophilic bacterium that belongs to the genus Campylobacter. It is considered the type strain of Campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni, a subspecies of the species Campylobacter jejuni.\n\nThis bacterial strain was isolated from a human patient with gastroenteritis in the United Kingdom in 1977 and has since become a widely used model organism for the study of Campylobacter infections. It is a fastidious microorganism, requiring specific growth conditions such as low oxygen levels and optimal temperature range for cultivation.\n\nCampylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni NCTC 11168 is known to be a common cause of foodborne gastroenteritis in humans, often associated with the consumption of undercooked poultry products. The bacterium possesses various virulence factors, including motility, adhesion, and invasion capabilities, which contribute to its ability to colonize the human gastrointestinal tract and cause disease.\n\nThe genome of this strain has been sequenced, and it has been extensively studied in the laboratory to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying Campylobacter pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, and the development of potential prevention and treatment strategies.",
