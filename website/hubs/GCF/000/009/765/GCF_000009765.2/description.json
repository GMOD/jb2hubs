  "description": "Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 = NBRC 14893 is a bacterium species belonging to the genus Streptomyces. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and filamentous actinobacterium. Streptomyces avermitilis is known for its ability to produce the anthelmintic compounds called avermectins, which are widely used as veterinary and human medicines for the treatment of parasitic infections.\n\nThe strain MA-4680 was initially isolated from a soil sample collected in Kawana, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. It has been designated as the type strain and is held in the NBRC (NITE Biological Resource Center) culture collection under the accession number NBRC 14893.\n\nGenome analysis has revealed that Streptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 has a linear chromosome of approximately 9 million base pairs and is known to possess a large number of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, contributing to its remarkable capacity for the production of diverse natural products.\n\nThis species is of great importance in the pharmaceutical industry due to its ability to produce the potent anthelmintic compounds avermectins, which have had a significant impact on the treatment of parasitic diseases in both humans and animals.",
