  "description": "Anaplasma marginale str. St. Maries is a species of tick-borne bacteria that infects and replicates within the red blood cells of cattle and other ruminants. It is the causative agent of bovine anaplasmosis, a significant disease in cattle worldwide.\n\nThe key characteristics of this bacterial species are:\n\n1. Obligate intracellular parasite: Anaplasma marginale str. St. Maries is an obligate intracellular bacterium, meaning it can only replicate and survive within the host's red blood cells.\n\n2. Gram-negative: It is a small, pleomorphic, Gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the order Rickettsiales.\n\n3. Marginal body formation: The bacterium forms characteristic marginal bodies or inclusions within the red blood cells, which is a diagnostic feature of anaplasmosis.\n\n4. Transmission: The bacteria are transmitted by various tick species, primarily Dermacentor ticks, which act as biological vectors, harboring and transmitting the pathogen to susceptible hosts.\n\n5. Pathogenesis: Infection with Anaplasma marginale str. St. Maries leads to the destruction of red blood cells, causing anemia, fever, and other clinical signs of bovine anaplasmosis, which can be fatal if left untreated.\n\n6. Genetic diversity: The St. Maries strain is a specific genotype or variant of Anaplasma marginale, which has been isolated and characterized from the state of Idaho, USA.\n\nThis species is of significant veterinary importance due to the severe economic impact of bovine anaplasmosis on cattle production and the challenges in controlling and preventing the disease in endemic regions.",
