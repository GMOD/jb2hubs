  "description": "Rickettsia bellii RML369-C is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular pathogens known to cause various tick-borne diseases. Rickettsia bellii RML369-C is a Gram-negative, pleomorphic, and coccobacillary bacterium that is typically found in association with arthropod hosts, particularly ticks.\n\nThis specific strain, RML369-C, was isolated from a tick of the genus Dermacentor collected in the United States. Rickettsia bellii is considered a member of the spotted fever group of Rickettsia, although it has some unique genomic and phenotypic characteristics that distinguish it from other members of this group.\n\nRickettsia bellii RML369-C is known to have a relatively wide host range, infecting various tick species and potentially other arthropods. While the pathogenicity of this particular strain is not well-established, the Rickettsia bellii species as a whole is not typically considered a significant human pathogen, although it may have some implications for veterinary or ecological health.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential impacts of Rickettsia bellii RML369-C and other strains within this species.",
