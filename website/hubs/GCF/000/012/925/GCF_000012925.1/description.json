  "description": "Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 is a species of anaerobic, dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria that belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class. It was first isolated from sediments of the Potomac River in the United States.\n\nKey features of Geobacter metallireducens GS-15:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is capable of using a variety of organic compounds, such as acetate, as electron donors, and it can couple the oxidation of these compounds to the reduction of metal ions, including iron (Fe(III)) and manganese (Mn(IV)).\n\n2. Electron transfer: Geobacter metallireducens can transfer electrons derived from the oxidation of organic compounds to extracellular electron acceptors, such as insoluble metal oxides, through a mechanism involving outer membrane cytochromes and conductive pili (or \"nanowires\").\n\n3. Bioremediation: Due to its ability to reduce and precipitate various toxic metal ions, Geobacter metallireducens has been studied for its potential applications in the bioremediation of metal-contaminated environments.\n\n4. Phylogenetic position: Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 is a member of the Geobacteraceae family, which is part of the Deltaproteobacteria class within the Proteobacteria phylum.\n\n5. Ecological significance: As a metal-reducing bacterium, Geobacter metallireducens plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of metals in various environments, particularly in anaerobic sediments and soils.\n\nOverall, Geobacter metallireducens GS-15 is a well-studied model organism for understanding the mechanisms of dissimilatory metal reduction and its potential applications in environmental biotechnology.",
