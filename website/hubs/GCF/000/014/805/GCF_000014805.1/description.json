  "description": "Aeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila ATCC 7966 is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, motile bacterium that belongs to the Aeromonadaceae family. This subspecies is commonly found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats, as well as in soil and sediments.\n\nAeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila ATCC 7966 is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause a variety of infections in humans and animals, including gastroenteritis, wound infections, septicemia, and meningitis. It is particularly problematic in immunocompromised individuals and can also affect fish, amphibians, and other aquatic organisms.\n\nThis subspecies is known for its ability to produce various virulence factors, such as cytotoxins, hemolysins, and proteases, which contribute to its pathogenicity. It is also capable of forming biofilms, which can enhance its resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune responses.\n\nAeromonas hydrophila subsp. hydrophila ATCC 7966 is commonly used in research and diagnostic settings as a representative strain for the study of Aeromonas infections, pathogenesis, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms.",
