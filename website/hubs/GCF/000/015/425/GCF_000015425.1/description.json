  "description": "Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It is a member of the Acinetobacter genus, which is part of the Gammaproteobacteria class within the Proteobacteria phylum.\n\nAcinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 is a clinically significant pathogen, known for its ability to cause a wide range of nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. This strain is particularly notable for its high levels of antibiotic resistance, making it a significant challenge in healthcare settings.\n\nThe genome of Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978 has been sequenced, revealing insights into its genetic makeup and potential mechanisms of virulence and drug resistance. This strain is widely used in research to study the biology, epidemiology, and antimicrobial resistance of this important opportunistic pathogen.",
