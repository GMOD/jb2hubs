  "description": "Brucella ovis ATCC 25840 is a bacterial species that belongs to the genus Brucella, a group of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and facultatively intracellular bacteria. Brucella ovis is the causative agent of ovine brucellosis, a disease primarily affecting sheep and occasionally goats.\n\nThe Brucella ovis ATCC 25840 strain is a well-characterized reference strain used in laboratory research and diagnostics. It is a smooth, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium that can survive and replicate within the host's phagocytic cells, particularly in the reticuloendothelial system. Brucella ovis is known to cause reproductive and fertility problems in infected sheep, leading to abortions, epididymitis, and orchitis.\n\nThis species is typically transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their placentas, or contaminated environments. Brucella ovis is considered less pathogenic to humans compared to other Brucella species, but it can still cause a relatively mild form of brucellosis in rare cases.\n\nIdentification and differentiation of Brucella ovis from other Brucella species often rely on specific serological tests, bacteriological culturing, and molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.",
