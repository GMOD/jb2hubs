  "description": "Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 = DSM 16493 is a species of bacteria that belongs to the class Alphaproteobacteria, order Rhodobacterales, and family Roseobacter. It was first isolated from the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima in the German Wadden Sea.\n\nDinoroseobacter shibae is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile, and aerobic bacterium. It has a curved rod-shaped morphology and can form rosettes. The cells are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species is known to be a member of the Roseobacter clade, which is a widely distributed and ecologically important group of marine bacteria. Dinoroseobacter shibae is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, and it can also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis using bacteriochlorophyll a.\n\nThe genome of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL 12 has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities, adaptation to the marine environment, and potential interactions with eukaryotic organisms, such as dinoflagellates.",
