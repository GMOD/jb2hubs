  "description": "Brucella microti CCM 4915 is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella. Brucella are small, gram-negative, facultatively intracellular coccobacilli known to cause brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that can infect a wide range of mammalian hosts.\n\nBrucella microti CCM 4915 was first isolated from the common vole (Microtus arvalis) in the Czech Republic. It is considered a recently discovered species within the Brucella genus, with characteristics that distinguish it from other Brucella species.\n\nGenetically, Brucella microti CCM 4915 has been shown to have a distinct genome compared to other Brucella species, indicating its evolutionary divergence. Additionally, it exhibits unique phenotypic traits, such as its ability to grow at lower temperatures and its limited host range, primarily infecting small rodents like the common vole.\n\nResearch on Brucella microti CCM 4915 is ongoing to further understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and potential implications for human and animal health, as it represents a newly identified member of the Brucella genus.",
