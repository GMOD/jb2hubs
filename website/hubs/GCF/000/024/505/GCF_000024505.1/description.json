  "description": "Anaplasma centrale str. Israel is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Anaplasma, which is a member of the family Anaplasmataceae. This bacterium is an obligate intracellular parasite that primarily infects and resides within the red blood cells of its host.\n\nAnaplasma centrale str. Israel is primarily found in cattle and is known to cause a mild form of anaplasmosis, a tick-borne disease that can result in fever, anemia, and other clinical symptoms in infected animals. This strain of A. centrale is considered less virulent compared to other Anaplasma species, such as Anaplasma marginale, which can cause more severe disease in cattle.\n\nThe genome of Anaplasma centrale str. Israel has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential mechanisms of pathogenesis. Studies have shown that this bacterium possesses a range of genes and molecular pathways that facilitate its survival and replication within the host's red blood cells, allowing it to establish a persistent infection.\n\nOverall, Anaplasma centrale str. Israel is an important veterinary pathogen that continues to be studied for its potential impact on the health and productivity of livestock, as well as its role in the broader ecosystem of tick-borne diseases.",
