  "description": "Candida dubliniensis CD36 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Candida. It is a fungal pathogen that can cause opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nCandida dubliniensis CD36 is a diploid, asexual, and dimorphic yeast. It can exist in both a yeast form and a hyphal form, which allows it to adapt to different environmental conditions. The yeast cells are typically oval-shaped and reproduce by budding.\n\nThis species was first isolated in 1995 from the oral cavities of HIV-positive individuals and was initially misidentified as Candida albicans, another Candida species. However, further genetic analysis revealed that it is a distinct species, Candida dubliniensis.\n\nCandida dubliniensis CD36 is closely related to Candida albicans, but it has several distinguishing characteristics, such as its ability to produce chlamydospores (thick-walled, resting cells) and its reduced ability to form germ tubes (a characteristic of Candida albicans).\n\nThis species is known to be an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or organ transplants. It is commonly associated with oral candidiasis (thrush) and can also cause invasive infections, such as bloodstream infections (candidemia).\n\nOngoing research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the virulence and pathogenicity of Candida dubliniensis CD36, as well as the development of improved diagnostic methods and treatment strategies for infections caused by this fungal species.",
