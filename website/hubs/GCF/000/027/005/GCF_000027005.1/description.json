  "description": "Komagataella phaffii GS115 is a species of methylotrophic yeast that is commonly used as a model organism for recombinant protein production. It is a single-celled, eukaryotic microorganism that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota and the class Saccharomycetes.\n\nThe GS115 strain of K. phaffii is a histidine auxotrophic mutant, meaning it requires the amino acid histidine for growth and survival. This characteristic makes it a useful host for genetic engineering and heterologous protein expression, as the histidine auxotrophy can be utilized as a selectable marker for the introduction of recombinant DNA.\n\nK. phaffii GS115 is known for its ability to efficiently express and secrete a wide range of recombinant proteins, including enzymes, antibodies, and other therapeutic proteins. This is facilitated by the strong and tightly regulated promoters, such as the alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter, which can be induced by the presence of methanol in the growth medium.\n\nThe genome of K. phaffii GS115 has been sequenced and extensively studied, providing valuable insights into its genetics, metabolism, and potential applications in biotechnology and biopharmaceutical production.",
