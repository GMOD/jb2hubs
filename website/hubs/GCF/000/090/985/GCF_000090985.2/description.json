  "description": "Micromonas commoda is a species of unicellular green algae belonging to the phylum Chlorophyta, class Mamiellophyceae, and order Mamiellales. It is a marine, free-living, and photosynthetic microorganism found in various oceanic environments, including coastal regions and open oceans.\n\nMicromonas commoda is a small, spherical or ovoid-shaped cell, typically measuring between 1.5 to 3 micrometers in diameter. It possesses a single, anterior flagellum that allows for its motility. The cell is surrounded by a cell wall and contains a single, cup-shaped chloroplast, which is the site of photosynthesis.\n\nThis species is known to play a significant role in marine primary production, contributing to the overall carbon and nutrient cycling in the oceans. Micromonas commoda is considered a key component of the picoplankton community, which includes the smallest photosynthetic organisms in the marine ecosystem.\n\nGenomic studies have revealed that Micromonas commoda has a relatively small genome size compared to other green algae, which may contribute to its ecological success and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is widely distributed across the world's oceans and has been observed in both temperate and tropical regions.",
