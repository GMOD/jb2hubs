  "description": "Ostreococcus lucimarinus CCE9901 is a species of unicellular green alga belonging to the class Mamiellophyceae. It is a marine phytoplankton species that is widely distributed in coastal and open ocean environments.\n\nOstreococcus lucimarinus CCE9901 is a small, spherical-shaped cell, approximately 0.8-1.2 micrometers in diameter. It has a single chloroplast, a single mitochondrion, and a single nucleus. The cell is surrounded by a cell wall and contains a single flagellum, which is used for locomotion.\n\nThis species is known to be an important contributor to primary productivity in marine ecosystems, playing a crucial role in the global carbon cycle. Ostreococcus lucimarinus CCE9901 is also known to be sensitive to environmental factors, such as temperature, light, and nutrient availability, making it a useful indicator organism for monitoring changes in marine ecosystems.\n\nThe strain CCE9901 was isolated from coastal waters off the coast of California, USA, and has been extensively studied for its genetic and physiological characteristics, as well as its potential applications in biotechnology and environmental research.",
