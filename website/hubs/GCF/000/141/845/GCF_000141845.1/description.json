  "description": "Paramecium tetraurelia is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism belonging to the phylum Ciliophora. The strain d4-2 is a specific genetic variant of this species. \n\nParamecium tetraurelia is a free-living, freshwater ciliate known for its complex cellular structure and behaviors. The d4-2 strain has been extensively studied as a model organism in various areas of cell biology and genetics. \n\nSome key features of Paramecium tetraurelia strain d4-2 include:\n\n1. Cell structure: It has a distinct, cigar-shaped body covered with thousands of cilia, which it uses for locomotion and feeding.\n\n2. Genetic makeup: The d4-2 strain has a well-characterized genome, with 40 chromosomes and an estimated 40,000 protein-coding genes.\n\n3. Cellular processes: Paramecium exhibits complex behaviors, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and conjugation (a form of sexual reproduction).\n\n4. Research applications: The d4-2 strain has been extensively used in studies of cell signaling, organelle biogenesis, and gene expression regulation, among other areas of cell biology.\n\nThis detailed genetic and functional information about Paramecium tetraurelia strain d4-2 has made it a valuable model organism in various fields of biological research.",
