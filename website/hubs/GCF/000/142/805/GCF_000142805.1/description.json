  "description": "Lachancea thermotolerans CBS 6340 is a species of yeast that belongs to the Lachancea genus. It is characterized as a thermotolerant yeast, meaning it can tolerate and grow at relatively high temperatures compared to other yeast species.\n\nThe strain CBS 6340 was isolated from soil samples and is known for its ability to produce lactic acid as a byproduct of its metabolism. This property makes it useful in various industrial applications, such as the production of fermented foods and beverages, as well as potential applications in biofuel production.\n\nLachancea thermotolerans CBS 6340 is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding. It is classified as a basidiomycete yeast and is known to exhibit a range of physiological and biochemical characteristics that make it adaptable to diverse environmental conditions.\n\nFurther research on the genomic and metabolic properties of this yeast strain could provide valuable insights into its potential applications in biotechnology and contribute to our understanding of the Lachancea genus and its role in various natural and industrial processes.",
