  "description": "Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335 is a unicellular, marine diatom species that belongs to the phylum Bacillariophyta. It is a small, centric diatom with a diameter ranging from 3 to 5 micrometers (Î¼m). The cell wall of T. pseudonana CCMP1335 is composed of silica, forming a unique, intricate pattern of perforations known as the frustule.\n\nThis species is a common and ecologically important component of marine phytoplankton communities, particularly in coastal and upwelling regions. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions, such as varying temperatures, nutrient levels, and light intensities.\n\nT. pseudonana CCMP1335 is an important model organism in the field of diatom biology and genomics. Its genome has been sequenced, providing valuable insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying diatom metabolism, cell division, and adaptation to the marine environment. This information has contributed to our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary significance of diatoms in marine ecosystems.",
