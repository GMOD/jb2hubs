  "description": "Aspergillus fischeri NRRL 181 is a species of filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It is a common environmental mold found in soil, decaying organic matter, and various other natural habitats.\n\nAspergillus fischeri NRRL 181 is a haploid, asexual fungus that reproduces through the formation of asexual spores called conidia. The fungus has a characteristic conidiophore structure, with a vesicle at the top from which the conidiophores radiate outward, bearing the conidia.\n\nGenetically, Aspergillus fischeri NRRL 181 has been studied extensively and is considered a model organism for the genus Aspergillus. It has a relatively small genome size compared to other Aspergillus species, making it a useful tool for genetic and genomic research.\n\nThis strain, NRRL 181, is a well-characterized and widely used reference strain of Aspergillus fischeri, and it has been deposited in various culture collections, such as the USDA's Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection (NRRL), for research and educational purposes.",
