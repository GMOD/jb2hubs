  "description": "Schizosaccharomyces japonicus yFS275 is a species of fission yeast, a type of unicellular eukaryotic microorganism. It belongs to the genus Schizosaccharomyces, which is known for its unique cell division mechanism called \"fission\" rather than the more common \"budding\" seen in other yeast species.\n\nThe strain yFS275 is a specific isolate or laboratory variant of the Schizosaccharomyces japonicus species. This strain has been widely used in scientific research, particularly in the study of cell biology, genetics, and molecular mechanisms underlying cellular processes in fission yeast.\n\nSchizosaccharomyces japonicus yFS275 is a haploid organism, meaning it has a single set of chromosomes. It is known to have a relatively short generation time and can be easily cultured in the laboratory, making it a valuable model organism for various experimental investigations.\n\nThe availability of the complete genome sequence and well-established genetic tools for this strain have contributed to its widespread use in the scientific community, allowing researchers to explore various aspects of eukaryotic cell biology, such as cell cycle regulation, cellular signaling pathways, and genome organization.",
