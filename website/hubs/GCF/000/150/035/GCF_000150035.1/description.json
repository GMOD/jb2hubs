  "description": "Vanderwaltozyma polyspora DSM 70294 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nThe cells of Vanderwaltozyma polyspora DSM 70294 are spherical to ovoid in shape, typically measuring between 4-8 micrometers in diameter. The yeast is able to produce multiple ascospores (up to 4) within a single ascus, which is a characteristic that distinguishes it from other related yeast species.\n\nVanderwaltozyma polyspora DSM 70294 is classified as a member of the genus Vanderwaltozyma, which is closely related to the genus Saccharomyces. It is known to be able to ferment various sugars and produce ethanol as a byproduct.\n\nThe strain DSM 70294 was originally isolated from soil samples and is maintained in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) culture collection, which serves as an important resource for the scientific study and preservation of microbial diversity.",
