  "description": "Schizosaccharomyces octosporus yFS286 is a species of fission yeast (also known as a schizosaccharomyces) that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic fungus that reproduces asexually through a process called binary fission, where the cell divides into two equal daughter cells.\n\nThe yFS286 strain of S. octosporus is a laboratory-adapted variant that has been widely used in genetic and molecular studies. It is known to have eight chromosomes and is capable of producing up to eight ascospores (sexual spores) within a single ascus (spore-containing structure) during its sexual reproductive cycle.\n\nS. octosporus yFS286 is a useful model organism for studying various cellular processes, such as cell division, DNA repair, and meiosis, due to its relatively simple genome and well-established genetic tools for manipulation and analysis.",
