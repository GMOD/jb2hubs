  "description": "Nannizzia gypsea CBS 118893 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Nannizzia. It is a dermatophyte, which means it is a type of fungus that can infect the skin, hair, and nails of humans and animals.\n\nThe strain CBS 118893 refers to the specific isolate of this fungal species that has been deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection. This culture collection is a recognized international repository for fungal strains.\n\nNannizzia gypsea is known to cause a type of fungal skin infection called tinea corporis, which is commonly referred to as \"ringworm.\" The fungus can infect various parts of the body, including the trunk, limbs, and even the scalp.\n\nMorphologically, Nannizzia gypsea is characterized by the production of asexual spores called arthroconidia, which are formed by the fragmentation of hyphae. These arthroconidia are the infective propagules that can be transmitted from one host to another.\n\nGenetically, Nannizzia gypsea can be distinguished from other dermatophyte species through molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing of specific genetic markers. The CBS 118893 strain may have been isolated from a clinical sample and deposited in the culture collection for further study and reference purposes.",
