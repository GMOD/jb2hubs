  "description": "Trichophyton benhamiae CBS 112371 is a species of dermatophyte fungus, which are a group of fungi that can infect the skin, hair, and nails of humans and animals. Trichophyton benhamiae is a member of the Trichophyton genus, which is known for its ability to cause various types of tinea infections, such as ringworm.\n\nThe CBS 112371 strain of T. benhamiae was isolated and identified by researchers, and it is considered a reference strain for this species. Dermatophytes like T. benhamiae are known to produce various enzymes and secondary metabolites that help them invade and colonize the keratin-rich tissues of the host. The growth characteristics, colony morphology, and genetic markers of this particular strain have been studied and documented in the scientific literature.\n\nTrichophyton benhamiae is typically found in the environment and can be transmitted to humans and animals through direct contact or exposure to contaminated surfaces. Understanding the biology and characteristics of this fungal species is important for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the infections it can cause.",
