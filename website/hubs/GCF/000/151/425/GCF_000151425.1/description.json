  "description": "Trichophyton rubrum CBS 118892 is a species of dermatophyte fungus that belongs to the genus Trichophyton. Dermatophytes are a group of fungi that can infect the skin, hair, and nails, causing various types of fungal infections known as tinea or dermatophytosis.\n\nTrichophyton rubrum is one of the most common and widespread dermatophyte species, responsible for a significant proportion of fungal skin infections in humans worldwide. The CBS 118892 strain is a specific isolate of this species, which has been deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection.\n\nMorphologically, T. rubrum CBS 118892 produces a slow-growing, powdery to granular colony on culture media, typically with a reddish-brown to wine-red pigmentation. Microscopically, the fungus exhibits characteristic septate hyphae, branching conidiophores, and numerous microconidia (small, round spores) that are produced in clusters.\n\nGenetically, T. rubrum CBS 118892 has been the subject of various molecular studies, contributing to our understanding of the genomic features and phylogenetic relationships within the Trichophyton genus. This information can be valuable for diagnostic, epidemiological, and evolutionary investigations of this clinically important fungal pathogen.",
