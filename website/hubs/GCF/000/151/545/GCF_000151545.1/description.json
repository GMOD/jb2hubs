  "description": "Saprolegnia parasitica CBS 223.65 is a species of oomycete, a water mold that belongs to the genus Saprolegnia. Oomycetes are eukaryotic, fungus-like organisms that are not true fungi but are classified as a separate group within the Stramenopila.\n\nSaprolegnia parasitica is an aquatic, filamentous organism that is considered a significant pathogen, primarily affecting freshwater fish and amphibians. It can cause a disease known as \"saprolegniasis,\" which can lead to significant economic losses in aquaculture and impact wild fish populations.\n\nThe strain CBS 223.65 is a specific isolate of Saprolegnia parasitica that was obtained from the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection, which is a major international repository for fungal and fungus-like organisms.\n\nThis strain has been used in various scientific studies and experiments to investigate the biology, ecology, and pathogenicity of Saprolegnia parasitica, contributing to our understanding of this important oomycete pathogen.",
