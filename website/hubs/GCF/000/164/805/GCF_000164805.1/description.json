  "description": "Carlito syrichta, commonly known as the Philippine tarsier, is a small primate species native to the Philippine archipelago. It belongs to the family Tarsiidae, which includes the tarsiers, a group of small, nocturnal primates known for their large, round eyes and specialized adaptations for an arboreal lifestyle.\n\nThe Philippine tarsier is a tiny mammal, typically measuring around 85-160 mm in head-body length and weighing between 80-160 grams. It has a distinctive, round head with large, forward-facing eyes that provide binocular vision, and extremely long, thin limbs with specialized hands and feet adapted for grasping and climbing. The tarsier's tail is also relatively long, often exceeding the length of its body, and is used for balance and as a prehensile organ.\n\nThese primates are primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. They are known for their remarkable leaping abilities, capable of jumping up to 5 meters between tree branches.\n\nThe Philippine tarsier is classified as a Vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting pressure in its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and fascinating primate species.",
