  "description": "Sorex araneus, commonly known as the common shrew, is a small insectivorous mammal belonging to the family Soricidae. It is one of the most widespread and abundant species of shrew found across Europe and Asia.\n\nThe common shrew is a small, slender-bodied creature with a pointed snout, small eyes, and rounded ears. Its fur is typically dark brown or reddish-brown on the upper parts, with a lighter grayish-brown underside. These shrews have a high metabolic rate and require a constant supply of food to sustain their energy needs.\n\nSorex araneus is primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and worms. They are known for their voracious appetite and can consume up to their own body weight in food each day. These shrews are important predators in their ecosystem, helping to regulate the populations of their prey species.\n\nShrews are solitary and territorial, with males and females occupying separate home ranges. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including high-pitched squeaks and ultrasonic calls. Breeding typically occurs in the spring, with females giving birth to litters of up to 10 young.\n\nThe common shrew is an integral part of many terrestrial ecosystems, playing a crucial role in the food chain and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its habitat.",
