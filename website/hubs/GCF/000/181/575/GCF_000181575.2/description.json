  "description": "Borreliella burgdorferi Bol26 is a species of spirochete bacteria that is the primary causative agent of Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness. It is a gram-negative, microaerophilic, and motile bacterium that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.\n\nThe Bol26 strain is a specific isolate of B. burgdorferi that has been extensively studied for its genetic and phenotypic characteristics. It was originally isolated from a patient with Lyme disease and has become a model strain for understanding the biology and pathogenesis of this important human pathogen.\n\nBorreliella burgdorferi Bol26 possesses a circular chromosome and several linear and circular plasmids that contribute to its virulence and adaptability within the tick vector and human host. The bacterium is able to evade the host's immune response and establish a persistent infection, leading to the characteristic symptoms of Lyme disease, such as a bullseye rash, flu-like symptoms, and potential long-term complications if left untreated.\n\nThe study of Borreliella burgdorferi Bol26 has provided valuable insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease, and it continues to be an important model organism for research on tick-borne infections and spirochete biology.",
