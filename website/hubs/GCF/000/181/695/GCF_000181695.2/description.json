  "description": "Malassezia globosa CBS 7966 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. It is a member of the phylum Basidiomycota, which includes fungi that produce their spores on club-shaped structures called basidia.\n\nMalassezia globosa is a lipophilic yeast, meaning it requires lipids or fatty substances for growth and survival. It is commonly found on the skin of humans and other warm-blooded animals, where it can be part of the normal microbiome. However, it can also be associated with certain skin conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and atopic dermatitis.\n\nThe strain CBS 7966 is a well-studied isolate of Malassezia globosa, which was originally obtained from human skin. It has a globose or spherical cell morphology, and it reproduces asexually through the formation of blastoconidia, which are budding yeast cells.\n\nGenomic studies have revealed that Malassezia globosa CBS 7966 has a relatively small genome size compared to other fungi, and it possesses a unique set of genes and metabolic pathways that enable it to thrive on the lipid-rich environment of the skin. Understanding the biology and ecology of this species can provide insights into its role in skin health and disease.",
