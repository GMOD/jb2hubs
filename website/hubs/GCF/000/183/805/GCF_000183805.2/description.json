  "description": "Loa loa, commonly known as the African eye worm or Calabar swelling, is a parasitic nematode worm that infects humans in certain regions of West and Central Africa. The species belongs to the Filarioidea superfamily, which includes several other medically important filarial worms.\n\nThe adult Loa loa worms are approximately 3-7 cm in length and live in the subcutaneous tissues and connective tissues of the human host. The female worms are responsible for producing microfilariae, which are the larval stage of the parasite that circulate in the host's bloodstream.\n\nInfection with Loa loa typically occurs through the bite of infected deer flies or mango flies (Chrysops species), which act as the intermediate hosts and vectors of the parasite. When the infective larvae are introduced into the human host, they migrate through the subcutaneous tissues and eventually mature into adult worms.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of Loa loa infection can include intermittent and migratory Calabar swellings, which are localized, painful, and edematous areas in the subcutaneous tissues, as well as the occasional visible movement of the adult worm under the skin, particularly in the eye region.\n\nLoa loa infection is endemic to certain areas of West and Central Africa, and it is considered an important public health concern in these regions due to its potential complications and the difficulties associated with its diagnosis and treatment.",
