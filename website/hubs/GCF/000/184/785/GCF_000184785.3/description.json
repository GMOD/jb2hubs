  "description": "Apis florea, commonly known as the dwarf honey bee or little honey bee, is a species of honey bee native to South and Southeast Asia. It is the smallest of the Apis honey bee species, with workers measuring around 8-10 mm in length.\n\nApis florea is a cavity-nesting bee, typically building its single, exposed comb on the branches of shrubs or small trees. The comb is often built in the open, without any protective covering, and is characterized by its unique inverted teardrop shape.\n\nThese bees are known for their gentle and docile nature, making them relatively easy to observe and handle. They are important pollinators, contributing to the pollination of a variety of agricultural crops and wild plants in their native range.\n\nApis florea colonies are relatively small, typically consisting of a single queen, several hundred to a few thousand workers, and a small number of drones. The bees produce a small amount of honey, which is sometimes harvested by local communities for consumption or traditional medicine.\n\nDue to habitat loss and the use of pesticides, Apis florea populations have declined in some areas, but the species is still considered to be of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
