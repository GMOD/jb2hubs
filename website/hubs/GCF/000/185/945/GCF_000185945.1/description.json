  "description": "Cryptococcus gattii WM276 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the Cryptococcus genus. This strain, WM276, is a member of the Cryptococcus gattii species complex, which is known to cause cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals.\n\nCryptococcus gattii WM276 is an encapsulated, basidiomycetous yeast that can reproduce both sexually and asexually. It is typically found in the environment, particularly in certain tree species, and can be transmitted to humans through inhalation of the fungal spores or desiccated yeast cells.\n\nThe genome of Cryptococcus gattii WM276 has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential virulence factors. This strain has been studied extensively due to its ability to cause cryptococcosis in otherwise healthy individuals, unlike the more common Cryptococcus neoformans species, which primarily affects immunocompromised patients.\n\nResearch on Cryptococcus gattii WM276 has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of cryptococcosis, a potentially life-threatening infection that requires prompt diagnosis and appropriate antifungal therapy.",
