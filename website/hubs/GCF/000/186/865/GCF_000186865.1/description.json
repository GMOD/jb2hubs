  "description": "Aureococcus anophagefferens is a small, unicellular phytoplankton species that belongs to the class Pelagophyceae. It is a type of brown tide algae that is known for its ability to form dense blooms in coastal waters.\n\nAureococcus anophagefferens is a spherical or oval-shaped cell, typically ranging in size from 2 to 5 micrometers in diameter. It has a golden-brown pigmentation due to the presence of carotenoids and chlorophyll-c, which are characteristic of the Pelagophyceae class.\n\nThis species is a mixotrophic organism, meaning it can obtain energy and nutrients through both photosynthesis and the ingestion of other small organisms, such as bacteria and other phytoplankton. This versatile feeding strategy allows Aureococcus anophagefferens to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, particularly in nutrient-rich coastal waters.\n\nBlooms of Aureococcus anophagefferens can have significant ecological and economic impacts, as the high cell densities can lead to decreased light penetration, hypoxia, and the production of toxins that can harm other marine organisms, including bivalves and finfish. The formation of these harmful brown tide events has been linked to factors such as eutrophication, climate change, and changes in microbial community composition.",
