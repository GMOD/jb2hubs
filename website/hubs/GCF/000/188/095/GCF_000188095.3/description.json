  "description": "Bombus impatiens, commonly known as the common eastern bumble bee, is a species of bumble bee native to eastern North America. It is a robust, fuzzy bee with a distinctive black and yellow coloration.\n\nBombus impatiens is a eusocial insect, living in colonies that can reach several hundred individuals. The colony is led by a single queen, who is responsible for egg-laying, while the sterile female workers perform tasks such as foraging, nest building, and brood care.\n\nThese bumble bees play a crucial role in the ecosystem as pollinators, visiting a wide variety of flowering plants and contributing to the reproduction of many plant species. Their large size and hairy bodies allow them to effectively transfer pollen from flower to flower.\n\nBombus impatiens is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a range of habitats, including agricultural areas, urban environments, and natural landscapes. However, like many other bee species, Bombus impatiens faces threats from habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change, which have contributed to declines in their populations in recent years.",
