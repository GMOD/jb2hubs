  "description": "Tetrahymena thermophila SB210 is a unicellular, ciliated protozoan species that belongs to the genus Tetrahymena. It is a free-living, freshwater microorganism commonly found in soil and aquatic environments.\n\nTetrahymena thermophila SB210 is a eukaryotic organism, meaning it has a well-defined nucleus and membrane-bound organelles within its cytoplasm. It possesses a complex and highly organized cellular structure, with a large macronucleus responsible for its vegetative growth and a smaller micronucleus involved in sexual reproduction.\n\nThis species is characterized by the presence of numerous cilia that cover its entire surface, enabling it to swim and move efficiently in its aquatic environment. Tetrahymena thermophila SB210 is also known for its ability to thrive in relatively high-temperature habitats, with an optimal growth temperature around 40°C (104°F).\n\nTetrahymena thermophila SB210 is widely used as a model organism in various fields of biology, including cell biology, genetics, and molecular biology, due to its well-characterized genome, ease of cultivation, and diverse cellular processes.",
