  "description": "Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e is a strain of the gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen.\n\nListeria monocytogenes EGD-e is a well-studied model strain that has been extensively used in research to understand the biology and pathogenesis of this bacterium. It is known for its ability to invade and replicate within host cells, particularly in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, which is a key feature of its virulence.\n\nThe genome of Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e has been sequenced, providing valuable insights into its genetic composition and the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity. This strain has been utilized in various studies to investigate the regulation of virulence factors, the host-pathogen interactions, and the adaptive responses of the bacterium to different environmental conditions.\n\nListeria monocytogenes EGD-e is an important model organism for the study of intracellular bacterial pathogens and their interactions with the host immune system, contributing to our understanding of the pathogenesis of listeriosis, a severe foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes.",
