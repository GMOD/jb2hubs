  "description": "Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis JAM81 is a chytrid fungus that is known to be the causative agent of the disease chytridiomycosis in amphibians. This particular strain, JAM81, was isolated from a dead mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, United States.\n\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis is a member of the Chytridiomycota phylum, which are a group of fungi that typically produce motile zoospores as their reproductive stage. The JAM81 strain is an aquatic, unicellular, and obligate parasitic fungus that primarily infects the keratinized skin of amphibians, leading to disruption of osmoregulation and eventual death of the host.\n\nGenomic analyses have revealed that the JAM81 strain possesses a relatively small genome compared to other fungi, comprising around 23 million base pairs. This strain has also been the subject of extensive research to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its virulence and pathogenicity in amphibian populations worldwide.",
