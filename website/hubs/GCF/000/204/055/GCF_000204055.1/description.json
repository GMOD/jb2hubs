  "description": "Melampsora larici-populina 98AG31 is a species of rust fungus that primarily infects poplar trees (Populus spp.) and larch trees (Larix spp.). It is a biotrophic pathogen, meaning it requires a living host to complete its life cycle. The fungus goes through a complex life cycle, alternating between the two host plant species.\n\nOn poplar trees, the fungus causes a disease known as poplar leaf rust, characterized by the formation of orange-yellow pustules on the leaves. These pustules release large numbers of spores that can be dispersed by wind to infect other poplar trees. On larch trees, the fungus forms different types of spores that allow it to complete its life cycle.\n\nThe 98AG31 strain refers to a specific genetic variant or isolate of Melampsora larici-populina that has been identified and studied in research settings. This particular strain may exhibit unique characteristics, such as differences in virulence, host specificity, or resistance to certain control measures, compared to other strains of the same fungal species.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and genetics of Melampsora larici-populina 98AG31 is important for developing effective management strategies to control the disease in forestry and agricultural settings where poplar and larch trees are cultivated.",
