  "description": "Theobroma cacao, commonly known as the cacao tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is the primary source of cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate.\n\nThe Theobroma cacao tree typically grows to a height of 4-8 meters (13-26 feet) and has large, leathery, oblong leaves that can reach up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length. The tree produces large, pod-like fruits called cacao pods, which can be green, red, or purple in color, depending on the variety.\n\nThe cacao pods contain 20-60 seeds, commonly referred to as cocoa beans, which are the primary commercial product of the tree. The cocoa beans are fermented, dried, and processed to extract the cocoa butter and cocoa solids, which are then used to produce a variety of chocolate products.\n\nTheobroma cacao is an economically important crop, with the global production of cocoa beans reaching around 4.8 million metric tons per year. The tree thrives in warm, humid climates with well-distributed rainfall and is cultivated in various regions, including West Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of Central and South America.",
