  "description": "Entamoeba dispar SAW760 is a species of protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Entamoeba. It is a non-invasive commensal organism that is closely related to the pathogenic species Entamoeba histolytica, which is the causative agent of amoebiasis.\n\nEntamoeba dispar SAW760 is found in the human gastrointestinal tract, primarily in the large intestine. It is a single-celled eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through binary fission. The life cycle of E. dispar SAW760 includes the formation of cysts, which are the infective stage of the parasite, and trophozoites, which are the active, feeding stage.\n\nUnlike E. histolytica, E. dispar SAW760 is considered a non-pathogenic species, as it does not invade the host's tissues or cause the severe symptoms associated with amoebiasis. However, it can still be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, similar to its pathogenic counterpart.\n\nThe strain designation \"SAW760\" refers to the specific isolate of E. dispar that was collected and characterized by researchers. This strain has been used in various studies to understand the biology, genetics, and epidemiology of this non-pathogenic Entamoeba species.",
