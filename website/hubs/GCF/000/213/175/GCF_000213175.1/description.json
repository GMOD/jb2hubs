  "description": "Neurospora tetrasperma FGSC 2508 is a filamentous ascomycete fungus that belongs to the genus Neurospora. This particular strain, FGSC 2508, is a laboratory stock strain maintained by the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC).\n\nNeurospora tetrasperma is a heterothallic species, meaning it has a bipolar mating system with two distinct mating types, designated as A and a. The FGSC 2508 strain is a homokaryotic strain, meaning it contains genetically identical nuclei within its hyphae.\n\nThe primary characteristic of N. tetrasperma is the production of asci (the spore-bearing structures) that typically contain four ascospores, hence the species name \"tetrasperma.\" The ascospores are the result of meiosis and are the primary means of reproduction for this fungus.\n\nNeurospora species, including N. tetrasperma, are widely used as model organisms in genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology research due to their relatively simple life cycle, well-characterized genetics, and ability to grow rapidly in laboratory conditions.",
