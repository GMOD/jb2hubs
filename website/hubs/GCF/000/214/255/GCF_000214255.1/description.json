  "description": "Bombus terrestris, commonly known as the buff-tailed bumblebee or large earth bumblebee, is a species of bumblebee native to Europe and Asia. It is a large, robust bumblebee with a distinct buff-colored abdomen and black and yellow bands on its body.\n\nBombus terrestris is an important pollinator, playing a crucial role in the ecosystem by facilitating the pollination of a wide range of flowering plants. These bees are known for their ability to collect pollen and nectar from various plant species, including agricultural crops, contributing to the productivity and biodiversity of the areas they inhabit.\n\nThe nest of Bombus terrestris is typically located underground, often in abandoned rodent burrows or other cavities. The colony is annual, with a single queen producing workers, males, and new queens throughout the active season. The queen is responsible for initiating the colony, laying eggs, and ensuring the colony's survival.\n\nBombus terrestris is recognized for its adaptability and has been introduced to various regions worldwide for its pollination services. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can disrupt the natural ecosystem and compete with native bumblebee species.",
