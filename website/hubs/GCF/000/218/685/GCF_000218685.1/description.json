  "description": "Serpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.9 is a fungal species that belongs to the order Boletales and the family Serpulaceae. It is a wood-decaying fungus commonly known as the dry rot fungus or the serpula dry rot.\n\nThis variety, S7.9, is a specific strain or genetic variant of the Serpula lacrymans species. Serpula lacrymans is a basidiomycete fungus that is known for its ability to cause significant damage to wooden structures, particularly in damp and poorly ventilated environments.\n\nThe fungus is characterized by its ability to produce a dense, fan-shaped mycelium that can spread rapidly through wood, causing it to become brittle and crumble. The mycelium is typically white or pale yellow in color and can produce distinctive fruiting bodies, which are small, tube-shaped structures that release spores.\n\nSerpula lacrymans var. lacrymans S7.9 is a specific genetic variant of the species that may exhibit unique characteristics or behaviors compared to other strains. Further research would be necessary to determine the specific traits or ecological roles of this particular variety.",
