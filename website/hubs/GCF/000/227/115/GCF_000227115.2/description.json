  "description": "Naumovozyma dairenensis CBS 421 is a species of yeast that belongs to the family Saccharomycetaceae. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Dairenensis, China.\n\nNaumovozyma dairenensis is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically spherical or ovoid in shape, with a diameter ranging from 3 to 6 micrometers.\n\nGenetically, Naumovozyma dairenensis has been characterized through sequencing of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (26S) rRNA gene. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that it is closely related to other species within the Naumovozyma genus, which is a distinct clade within the Saccharomycetaceae family.\n\nPhysiologically, Naumovozyma dairenensis is capable of fermenting a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, and can grow in a wide range of temperatures, typically between 15 and 30 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe ecological role and potential biotechnological applications of Naumovozyma dairenensis are still under investigation, as this species has not been extensively studied compared to other yeast species of commercial or scientific interest.",
