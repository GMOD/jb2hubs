  "description": "Tetrapisispora phaffii CBS 4417 is a species of yeast belonging to the family Saccharomycetaceae. It is a haploid, ascomycetous fungus that reproduces asexually through the formation of ascospores.\n\nSome key features of this species:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are typically round or oval-shaped, ranging in size from 3-6 Î¼m in diameter.\n\n2. Reproduction: T. phaffii reproduces asexually through the formation of four hat-shaped ascospores within each ascus (a specialized structure for spore production).\n\n3. Habitat and distribution: This species has been isolated from various natural environments, including soil, plant materials, and insect-associated habitats.\n\n4. Physiology and metabolism: T. phaffii is able to ferment glucose and assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources. It is known to have applications in biotechnology, such as in the production of enzymes and other valuable compounds.\n\n5. Taxonomic classification: T. phaffii belongs to the genus Tetrapisispora, which is classified within the family Saccharomycetaceae, order Saccharomycetales, and phylum Ascomycota.\n\nThis brief scientific description provides an overview of the key characteristics and taxonomic placement of the yeast species Tetrapisispora phaffii CBS 4417.",
