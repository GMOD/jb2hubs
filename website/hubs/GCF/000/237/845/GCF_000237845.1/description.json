  "description": "Rickettsia slovaca 13-B is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites. It is a gram-negative, pleomorphic, and coccobacillary bacterium.\n\nRickettsia slovaca 13-B is primarily transmitted by the tick species Dermacentor marginatus and is responsible for causing a disease known as \"tick-borne lymphadenopathy\" (TIBOLA) or \"Dermacentor-borne necrosis-erythema-lymphadenopathy\" (DEBONEL) in humans.\n\nThe bacterium infects and replicates within the endothelial cells of the host, leading to vasculitis and the characteristic clinical manifestations of the disease. Symptoms typically include an eschar (necrotic skin lesion) at the site of the tick bite, regional lymphadenopathy, and various flu-like symptoms.\n\nRickettsia slovaca 13-B is considered an emerging pathogen, and its distribution is primarily limited to certain regions of Europe, such as Slovakia, France, Spain, and Italy, where the vector tick species is present. Proper diagnosis and timely antibiotic treatment are essential for the management of Rickettsia slovaca 13-B infections.",
