  "description": "Schistosoma mansoni is a species of parasitic flatworm that causes a chronic and debilitating disease known as schistosomiasis or bilharzia. It is a member of the Schistosomatidae family and is one of the major causative agents of schistosomiasis in humans, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America.\n\nThe life cycle of S. mansoni involves both a human host and an intermediate snail host. The adult worms reside in the mesenteric veins of the human host, where they mate and produce eggs. These eggs are released into the intestinal lumen and are passed out of the body through feces. In the environment, the eggs hatch and release free-swimming larval forms called miracidia, which then infect specific species of freshwater snails, primarily of the genus Biomphalaria.\n\nInside the snail host, the miracidia develop into sporocysts, which then produce cercariae, the infective larval stage. The cercariae are released from the snail and can penetrate the human skin during contact with contaminated water, such as during activities like swimming, bathing, or washing. Once inside the human host, the cercariae mature into adult worms and migrate to the mesenteric veins, completing the life cycle.\n\nSchistosoma mansoni infection can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including intestinal and hepatic involvement, as well as severe complications such as liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, and bladder cancer. The disease is a significant public health concern in many developing countries, and control efforts focus on treatment, snail control, and improving access to clean water and sanitation.",
