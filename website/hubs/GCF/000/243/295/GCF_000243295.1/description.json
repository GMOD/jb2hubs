  "description": "Trichechus manatus latirostris, commonly known as the Florida manatee, is a subspecies of the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). It is a large, aquatic, herbivorous mammal that inhabits the coastal and inland waterways of the southeastern United States, primarily in the state of Florida.\n\nThe Florida manatee is characterized by its large, barrel-shaped body, with a rounded, paddle-like tail and short, stubby flippers. They have a broad, blunt snout and their bodies are covered in thick, wrinkled skin that is typically gray or brown in color. Adult Florida manatees can grow up to 13 feet (4 meters) in length and weigh up to 1,200 pounds (540 kilograms).\n\nThese mammals are well-adapted to their aquatic environment, with a slow metabolism and the ability to hold their breath for up to 20 minutes. They are primarily grazers, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, including seagrasses, algae, and various floating and submerged vegetation.\n\nThe Florida manatee is a protected species, listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. They face various threats, including collisions with watercraft, loss of habitat, and exposure to cold temperatures, which can lead to cold stress and death. Conservation efforts, such as designated manatee protection zones and public awareness campaigns, are ongoing to ensure the long-term survival of this unique and charismatic species.",
