  "description": "Phytophthora nicotianae INRA-310 is a species of water mold, which is a type of oomycete, belonging to the genus Phytophthora. It is a plant pathogen that can infect a wide range of host plants, including economically important crops such as tobacco (Nicotiana spp.).\n\nThe INRA-310 strain of P. nicotianae was specifically isolated from tobacco plants. This strain has been studied extensively for its pathogenicity, epidemiology, and potential management strategies in tobacco cultivation.\n\nAs a water mold, P. nicotianae INRA-310 thrives in moist environments and can spread through the movement of water, soil, or infected plant material. It produces motile zoospores that can swim and infect plant roots, stems, and leaves, leading to a range of symptoms, such as root rot, leaf blight, and wilting.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and characteristics of P. nicotianae INRA-310 is crucial for developing effective disease management strategies in tobacco production, as well as for furthering our knowledge of the Phytophthora genus and its interactions with plant hosts.",
