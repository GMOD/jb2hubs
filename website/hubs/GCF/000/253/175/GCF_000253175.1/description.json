  "description": "Yersinia enterocolitica subsp. palearctica Y11 is a bacterial subspecies that belongs to the Yersinia enterocolitica species, which is a member of the Yersinia genus. Yersinia enterocolitica is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nThe subspecies Y. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica Y11 is specifically known to be found in the Palearctic biogeographic region, which encompasses Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. This subspecies is typically associated with human and animal gastrointestinal infections, causing a disease known as yersiniosis.\n\nY. enterocolitica subsp. palearctica Y11 possesses various virulence factors, such as the plasmid-encoded Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) and the chromosomally encoded type III secretion system, which enable the bacterium to evade the host's immune response and cause disease. The subspecies has been the subject of scientific research, particularly in understanding its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential impact on public health.",
