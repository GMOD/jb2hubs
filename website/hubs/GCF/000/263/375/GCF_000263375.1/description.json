  "description": "Wallemia mellicola CBS 633.66 is a species of fungus belonging to the genus Wallemia, which is a member of the phylum Basidiomycota. This species is known to be xerophilic, meaning it can grow in environments with low water activity, such as high-sugar or high-salt conditions.\n\nWallemia mellicola CBS 633.66 is a small, unicellular fungus that reproduces asexually through the formation of small, single-celled spores called conidia. These conidia are typically globose or subglobose in shape and measure approximately 2-4 Î¼m in diameter.\n\nThe colonies of this species are typically slow-growing, compact, and velvety in texture, often with a white, tan, or pink coloration. Microscopically, the hyphae of W. mellicola CBS 633.66 are thin, septate, and hyaline (translucent).\n\nThis species has been isolated from various substrates, including honey, dried fruits, and other high-sugar or high-salt environments. It is considered a common environmental fungus and has been reported to have a global distribution.",
