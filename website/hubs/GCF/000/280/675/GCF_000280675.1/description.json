  "description": "Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860 is a strain of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Entomopathogenic fungi are microorganisms that can infect and kill insects and other arthropods.\n\nBeauveria bassiana is a ubiquitous fungus found in soils worldwide. The ARSEF 2860 strain was isolated from a dead insect and is maintained in the USDA-ARS Collection of Entomopathogenic Fungal Cultures (ARSEF).\n\nThis strain is known to produce a suite of insecticidal compounds, including the cyclic depsipeptide beauvericin, which disrupts cell membranes and induces apoptosis in insect cells. The fungus can infect a wide range of insect pests, including beetles, caterpillars, and flies, through direct contact and subsequent penetration of the insect cuticle.\n\nOngoing research explores the potential of Beauveria bassiana ARSEF 2860 as a biological control agent against various agricultural and forest pests, as well as its mode of action and interactions with the insect immune system.",
