It is a dematiaceous hyphomycete, meaning it produces dark-colored, septate hyphae and conidia (asexual spores).\n\nThis particular strain, with the accession number CBS 100218, was isolated from a sample collected in Germany. Coniosporium apollinis is known to be a saprobic fungus, meaning it derives its nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter.\n\nThe fungus is characterized by its slow-growing, velvety, olive-brown to black colonies on culture media. Microscopically, it produces solitary, dark-colored, septate conidiophores that give rise to single, spherical to ellipsoidal, dark-pigmented conidia.\n\nConiosporium apollinis is considered a member of the Dothideomycetes class within the Ascomycota phylum of fungi. It is typically found in association with various plant materials, soil, and other environmental sources, playing a role in the decomposition of organic matter.",
