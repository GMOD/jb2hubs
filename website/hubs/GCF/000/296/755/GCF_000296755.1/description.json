  "description": "Erinaceus europaeus, commonly known as the European hedgehog, is a small mammal belonging to the family Erinaceidae. This species is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny coat, which is used as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nThe European hedgehog is a nocturnal and insectivorous animal, primarily feeding on insects, small vertebrates, and plant matter. It has a rounded body, short snout, and small eyes and ears. The spines, which are modified hairs, cover the back and sides of the animal, providing protection from predators. When threatened, the hedgehog can roll up into a ball, exposing its spines to potential attackers.\n\nErinaceus europaeus is a solitary animal, with individuals living in burrows or nests constructed from leaves, grass, and other natural materials. They are known to hibernate during the winter months, conserving energy by lowering their body temperature and metabolic rate.\n\nThe European hedgehog plays an important role in its ecosystem, serving as a predator of various insects and invertebrates, and as a food source for larger predators. However, habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as the use of pesticides, have contributed to a decline in their population in some regions.",
