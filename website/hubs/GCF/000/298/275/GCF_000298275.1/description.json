  "description": "Orycteropus afer afer, commonly known as the Cape aardvark, is a subspecies of the aardvark (Orycteropus afer) found in southern Africa. Aardvarks are unusual mammals that belong to the order Tubulidentata, which is a group of mammals that have unique tooth structures.\n\nThe Cape aardvark is a medium-sized mammal, typically weighing between 40 to 80 kilograms. It has a stocky, pig-like body with a large, elongated head, small eyes, and large ears. The skin is thick and coarse, and the body is covered with sparse, course hair that ranges in color from reddish-brown to gray. Aardvarks have a long, sticky tongue that they use to feed on ants and termites, which are their primary food source.\n\nAardvarks are nocturnal animals and spend the majority of the day sleeping in their burrows, which they dig themselves or take over from other animals. They are known for their impressive burrowing abilities, using their strong claws and powerful front legs to dig extensive tunnel systems.\n\nThe Cape aardvark is found in a variety of habitats, including savannas, grasslands, and semi-desert regions, throughout southern Africa. They play an important role in their ecosystem, as their burrows provide shelter for various other species and their feeding habits help to control the populations of ants and termites.",
