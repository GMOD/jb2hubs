  "description": "Elephantulus edwardii, commonly known as the Cape rock elephant-shrew or Edward's rock elephant-shrew, is a small mammal species classified under the order Macroscelidea, which includes elephant-shrews or sengis.\n\nThe Cape rock elephant-shrew is native to the southwestern parts of South Africa, primarily found in the Cape Floristic Region. It is a small, insectivorous animal, typically weighing between 40-70 grams, with a long, flexible snout and large, round ears. The species has a grayish-brown fur coat and a long, scaly tail, which it uses for balance and as a storage depot for fat reserves.\n\nElephant-shrews are known for their unique adaptations, including their elongated snout, which they use to forage for insects, small vertebrates, and plant matter. They are agile and quick, able to move rapidly across rocky or uneven terrain, and they are excellent climbers, often found in rocky outcrops and dense vegetation.\n\nThe Cape rock elephant-shrew is a solitary and territorial species, with each individual occupying a home range that it actively defends against conspecifics. They are primarily diurnal, with their peak activity periods occurring during the early morning and late afternoon hours.\n\nThis species plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a prey item for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the Cape Floristic Region, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.",
