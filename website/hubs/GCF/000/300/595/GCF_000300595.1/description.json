  "description": "Phanerochaete carnosa HHB-10118-sp is a species of wood-rotting fungus that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a member of the order Polyporales and the family Phanerochaetaceae.\n\nPhanerochaete carnosa is a white-rot fungus, meaning it has the ability to efficiently degrade the lignin component of wood, leaving behind the cellulose. This allows the fungus to colonize and decompose a wide range of woody substrates, including both hardwood and softwood species.\n\nThe fungus produces a resupinate (crust-like) basidiocarp (fruiting body) that is typically thin, membranous, and adnate (closely attached) to the substrate. The hymenium (spore-bearing surface) is smooth to slightly tuberculate (with small, rounded projections) and can range in color from white to cream or pale yellow.\n\nMicroscopically, Phanerochaete carnosa HHB-10118-sp is characterized by its simple-septate hyphae, which lack clamp connections, and its production of thin-walled, cylindrical to slightly allantoid (sausage-shaped) basidiospores.\n\nThis particular strain, HHB-10118-sp, was isolated and studied for its potential in various biotechnological applications, such as the biodegradation of lignocellulosic materials and the production of enzymes or other valuable compounds.",
