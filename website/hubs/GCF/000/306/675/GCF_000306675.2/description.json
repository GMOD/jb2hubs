  "description": "Leptospira mayottensis 200901116 is a species of pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genus Leptospira. It was first isolated in 2009 from a patient on the island of Mayotte, located in the Indian Ocean.\n\nLeptospira mayottensis is a spirochete, a type of spiral-shaped bacterium, that is capable of causing the zoonotic disease leptospirosis in humans and animals. The bacterium is transmitted through contact with water, soil, or other environments contaminated with the urine of infected animals, such as rodents.\n\nGenetically, Leptospira mayottensis is classified as a member of the Leptospira interrogans serogroup, which includes several other pathogenic Leptospira species. Genomic analysis has revealed that Leptospira mayottensis is closely related to, but distinct from, other known Leptospira species.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of leptospirosis caused by Leptospira mayottensis can range from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe, life-threatening complications, such as kidney and liver failure, and hemorrhage. Effective diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and improve patient outcomes.",
