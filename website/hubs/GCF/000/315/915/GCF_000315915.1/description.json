  "description": "Henningerozyma blattae CBS 6284 is a species of yeast that was isolated from the gut of a cockroach (Blattella germanica). It belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, and the genus Henningerozyma.\n\nHenningerozyma blattae is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically round or oval-shaped, with a smooth cell surface. This yeast species is able to ferment various carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, and can grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene has confirmed the placement of Henningerozyma blattae within the Henningerozyma genus. This genus was named after the German mycologist Wilhelm Henniger, who made significant contributions to the study of yeasts.\n\nThe ecological role of Henningerozyma blattae within the cockroach gut microbiome is not fully understood, but it is likely involved in the digestion and utilization of the host's diet, contributing to the overall metabolic processes of the cockroach. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific interactions and functions of this yeast species in its natural habitat.",
