  "description": "Helobdella robusta is a species of freshwater leech belonging to the family Glossiphoniidae. It is commonly known as the robust leech or the giant glossiphoniid leech.\n\nHelobdella robusta is a relatively large freshwater leech, typically measuring between 20-50 millimeters in length when fully extended. The body is elongated and flattened, with a distinct anterior sucker and a smaller posterior sucker. The species is characterized by its robust, muscular appearance, which gives it the common name \"robust leech.\"\n\nThis leech is found in various freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, across North America. It is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, acting as a predator and scavenger, feeding on small invertebrates, fish, and even other leeches.\n\nHelobdella robusta reproduces through a unique process called clitellate reproduction, where the leech produces a cocoon-like structure that contains its eggs and young. The young leeches, known as hatchlings, emerge from the cocoon and undergo a direct development, without a larval stage.\n\nThe robust leech is considered an important model organism in the study of leech biology, development, and regeneration, as it has the ability to regenerate lost body parts, including its anterior and posterior suckers.",
