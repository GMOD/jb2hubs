  "description": "Gossypium raimondii, commonly known as the Peruvian cotton, is a species of cotton plant that is native to Peru. It is a diploid species, meaning it has two sets of chromosomes (2n = 26).\n\nThe Gossypium raimondii plant is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. It has palmately lobed leaves with three to five lobes. The flowers are yellow, and the fruit is a capsule-like boll that contains the cotton fibers.\n\nThis species is considered one of the wild progenitor species of cultivated cotton, and it is believed to have contributed genetic material to the development of some modern cotton varieties. Gossypium raimondii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is known for its tolerance to drought and high temperatures.\n\nThe cotton fibers of Gossypium raimondii are relatively short and coarse compared to those of other cotton species, but they have unique properties that may be of interest for specialized textile applications. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this species, as it is considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation.",
