  "description": "Orcinus orca, commonly known as the killer whale or orca, is a large, toothed whale species that belongs to the Delphinidae family. Orcas are the largest members of the dolphin family and are easily recognizable by their distinctive black and white coloration, with a large, rounded dorsal fin and a streamlined, hydrodynamic body shape.\n\nOrcas are found in all the world's major oceans, from the Arctic and Antarctic regions to the tropics, and are known for their intelligence, social behavior, and hunting prowess. They are apex predators, feeding on a diverse range of prey, including fish, seals, sea lions, dolphins, and even other whale species.\n\nOrcas have a complex social structure, often living in tight-knit family groups or \"pods,\" and communicating with a variety of vocalizations, including whistles, clicks, and pulsed calls. They are known for their impressive hunting strategies, which can involve coordinated group efforts to herd and capture their prey.\n\nOrcas are considered highly intelligent animals, with a large brain-to-body ratio and the ability to learn and adapt to new environments. They are also known for their playful and curious behavior, and have been the subject of extensive scientific research and conservation efforts.",
