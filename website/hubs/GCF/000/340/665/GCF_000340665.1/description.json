  "description": "Cajanus cajan, commonly known as pigeon pea or red gram, is a leguminous crop plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is an important food and forage crop cultivated extensively in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa.\n\nCajanus cajan is a perennial, semi-woody shrub that can grow up to 4 meters in height. The plant has a deep taproot and several branching stems. The leaves are compound, with 3-5 leaflets that are elliptical or lanceolate in shape. The flowers are yellow, and the fruits are long, flattened pods that contain 3-6 pea-like seeds.\n\nThe seeds of Cajanus cajan are a rich source of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and essential minerals such as iron, calcium, and phosphorus. They are commonly used in various cuisines, either as a whole grain or as a split pulse (dal). The plant is also valued for its forage and green manure properties, as the leaves and stems can be used as animal feed or incorporated into the soil to improve soil fertility.\n\nCajanus cajan is known for its drought tolerance and adaptability to a wide range of soil conditions, making it a valuable crop in regions with limited water resources or poor soil quality. It is also a nitrogen-fixing plant, which helps to improve soil fertility and support the growth of other crops in mixed cropping systems.",
