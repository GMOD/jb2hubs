  "description": "Huiozyma naganishii CBS 8797 is a species of yeast that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Japan. It belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, the class Saccharomycetes, and the order Saccharomycetales.\n\nHuiozyma naganishii is a unicellular, asexual, and heterotrophic organism that reproduces by budding. The cells are typically round or oval-shaped, and they can range in size from approximately 3 to 5 micrometers in diameter.\n\nBiochemically, Huiozyma naganishii is able to assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and trehalose, and it can also grow in the presence of ethanol. The species is known to produce small amounts of extracellular enzymes, such as xylanase and cellulase, which may contribute to its ecological role in soil environments.\n\nPhylogenetically, Huiozyma naganishii is closely related to other members of the genus Huiozyma, which are commonly found in soil and plant-associated habitats. The species was first described and named in 2007 based on its morphological and physiological characteristics, as well as its unique DNA sequence data.",
