  "description": "Mesocricetus auratus, commonly known as the golden hamster, is a small rodent species native to the Syrian desert region. It is a member of the Cricetidae family, which includes other hamsters and voles.\n\nThe golden hamster is a compact, round-bodied animal with a short tail and large cheek pouches. Its fur is typically a golden-brown color, with a white belly and legs. Adults typically measure between 5-7 inches (12-18 cm) in length and weigh between 4-8 ounces (110-220 grams).\n\nMesocricetus auratus is a solitary, nocturnal species that is known for its burrowing behavior and food hoarding habits. They construct elaborate underground burrow systems with multiple chambers and tunnels. Golden hamsters are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of seeds, grains, insects, and small vertebrates.\n\nThese hamsters are widely used in scientific research, particularly in the fields of genetics, behavior, and physiology. They are also popular as pets due to their small size, docile nature, and relatively long lifespan of 2-3 years in captivity.\n\nConservation-wise, the golden hamster is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, as its widespread distribution and adaptability to various habitats have allowed it to maintain stable populations in the wild.",
