  "description": "Cyphellophora europaea CBS 101466 is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Cyphellophora. It is classified under the phylum Ascomycota, which is a large and diverse group of fungi that produce spores in sac-like structures called asci.\n\nCyphellophora europaea CBS 101466 is a dematiaceous (dark-pigmented) hyphomycete, meaning it produces dark-colored, septate (divided) hyphae and conidiophores (spore-bearing structures). The conidiophores are erect and branched, and they produce chains of pigmented, septate conidia (asexual spores).\n\nThis species was first isolated from a human skin sample in Europe, hence the specific epithet \"europaea.\" It is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various types of skin and soft tissue infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nMorphologically, Cyphellophora europaea CBS 101466 can be distinguished by its dark-colored, septate hyphae and the production of chains of pigmented, septate conidia on branched conidiophores. Molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing, are often used to confirm the identification of this species and differentiate it from other closely related Cyphellophora species.",
