  "description": "Nicotiana tomentosiformis is a species of wild tobacco plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1-2 meters. The leaves are broad, oblong-ovate in shape, and covered in a dense, velvety tomentose (woolly) pubescence, which gives the plant a distinctive soft, fuzzy appearance.\n\nThe flowers of N. tomentosiformis are tubular, with a corolla that is white or pale yellow in color. The flowers are arranged in terminal inflorescences, and the plant produces capsular fruits containing numerous small seeds.\n\nTaxonomically, N. tomentosiformis belongs to the genus Nicotiana, which includes around 70 species of tobacco plants. It is closely related to other wild Nicotiana species found in the Andes region of South America.\n\nEcologically, N. tomentosiformis is adapted to grow in diverse habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in the local plant communities and food webs as a nectar source for various pollinators.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, N. tomentosiformis is an important species for understanding the evolutionary history and genetic diversity within the Nicotiana genus, as well as its potential use in tobacco breeding and biotechnology applications.",
