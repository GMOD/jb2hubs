  "description": "Nicotiana sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland tobacco or wild tobacco, is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae. It is native to northwestern Argentina and southern Bolivia.\n\nNicotiana sylvestris is a perennial herbaceous plant that can grow up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall. The leaves are large, oblong-lanceolate in shape, and can reach up to 50 cm (20 inches) in length. The flowers are white, tubular, and arranged in large, terminal inflorescences.\n\nThis species is known for its high nicotine content, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces a wide range of secondary metabolites, including various alkaloids, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and taste.\n\nNicotiana sylvestris is closely related to the commercially important tobacco species, Nicotiana tabacum, and has been used in breeding programs to introduce desirable traits, such as disease resistance, into cultivated tobacco varieties.",
