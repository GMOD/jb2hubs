  "description": "Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that is commonly found in the soil and in dairy products. The strain Clostridium tyrobutyricum DSM 2637 = ATCC 25755 = JCM 11008 is a well-characterized isolate of this species.\n\nThis bacterium is rod-shaped, with the ability to form ellipsoidal, subterminal spores. It is motile, using peritrichous flagella for locomotion. Clostridium tyrobutyricum is a chemoorganotroph, obtaining energy through the fermentation of various carbohydrates, producing butyric acid as the primary metabolic end-product.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for this strain include anaerobic environments, with a temperature range of 25-40Â°C and a pH range of 5.5-8.0. It is commonly isolated from dairy products, where it can contribute to the development of desired flavors, but can also cause spoilage through the production of gas and off-flavors.\n\nClostridium tyrobutyricum DSM 2637 = ATCC 25755 = JCM 11008 has been widely used in research, particularly in studies related to butyric acid production, dairy fermentation, and the ecology of anaerobic bacterial communities.",
