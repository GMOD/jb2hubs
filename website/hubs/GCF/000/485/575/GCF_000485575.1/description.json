  "description": "Poecilia formosa, commonly known as the Amazon molly, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Poeciliidae. It is a small, livebearing fish native to the coastal regions of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas in the United States.\n\nThe Amazon molly is an all-female species, reproducing through a process called gynogenesis, where the females produce clones of themselves without the involvement of males. This unique reproductive strategy allows the species to maintain genetic diversity despite its lack of sexual reproduction.\n\nThese fish are typically gray or olive-colored, with a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body and a forked caudal fin. They can grow up to around 6 centimeters (2.4 inches) in length and are known to inhabit slow-moving, shallow waters such as streams, rivers, and lakes.\n\nThe Amazon molly is an important model organism in the study of evolutionary biology, particularly in the context of asexual reproduction and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Its unique reproductive strategy has made it a subject of significant scientific interest and research.",
