  "description": "Erythranthe guttata, commonly known as the seep monkeyflower, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Erythranthe (formerly Mimulus). It is a perennial, herbaceous plant native to western North America, ranging from British Columbia to Baja California.\n\nErythranthe guttata typically grows 10-30 cm tall, with erect, branching stems. The leaves are opposite, simple, and oblong to lance-shaped, with a toothed margin. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical, with a tubular corolla that is typically yellow with red or maroon spots or blotches. The flowers are typically 15-30 mm in length and are borne singly in the leaf axils.\n\nThe species is adapted to moist, seepy habitats, such as springs, seeps, and streambanks, and is often found growing in the splash zones of waterfalls or on the edges of ponds and lakes. It plays an important role in the ecology of these wetland environments, providing nectar and pollen resources for various pollinator species.\n\nErythranthe guttata is of interest to botanists and conservation biologists due to its adaptations to specialized habitats and its potential as an indicator species for the health of freshwater ecosystems in western North America.",
