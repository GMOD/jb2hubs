  "description": "Kwoniella mangroviensis CBS 8507 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, and order Tremellales. It was first isolated from mangrove sediment collected in Hainan Island, China.\n\nThe key characteristics of Kwoniella mangroviensis CBS 8507 are:\n\n1. Colony morphology: Colonies on agar media are cream-colored, smooth, and butyrous (butter-like) in texture.\n\n2. Cell morphology: Cells are spherical to ellipsoidal, measuring 4-8 μm in diameter. They reproduce by budding.\n\n3. Physiological characteristics: The yeast is able to assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and raffinose. It can grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 35°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 25°C.\n\n4. Habitat and ecology: Kwoniella mangroviensis CBS 8507 is found in mangrove sediments, suggesting it may play a role in the decomposition of organic matter in these coastal ecosystems.\n\n5. Taxonomic placement: Phylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA sequences has confirmed the placement of this species within the genus Kwoniella, which is known to contain several other yeast species isolated from various marine and terrestrial habitats.\n\nThis brief scientific description provides an overview of the key features and characteristics of Kwoniella mangroviensis CBS 8507, a yeast species found in mangrove environments.",
