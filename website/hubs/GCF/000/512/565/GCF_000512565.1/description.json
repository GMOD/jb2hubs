  "description": "Kwoniella dejecticola CBS 10117 is a species of yeast belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. It was isolated from bird droppings in the Netherlands.\n\nKwoniella dejecticola is a unicellular, round to oval-shaped fungus that reproduces asexually through the formation of budding cells. The cells are typically 4-6 Î¼m in diameter. The species can grow on a variety of media, including standard yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar.\n\nGenetically, Kwoniella dejecticola belongs to the genus Kwoniella, which is classified within the order Tremellales. Phylogenetic analysis based on ribosomal DNA sequences has shown that this species is closely related to other Kwoniella species found in various environmental samples, including soil and animal-associated habitats.\n\nNot much is known about the specific ecological roles or metabolic capabilities of Kwoniella dejecticola. As a yeast species isolated from bird droppings, it likely plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter in those habitats. Further research would be needed to elucidate its precise niche and interactions within microbial communities.",
