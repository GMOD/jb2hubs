  "description": "Limulus polyphemus, commonly known as the Atlantic horseshoe crab, is a species of arthropod that belongs to the Chelicerata subphylum. It is one of the oldest living species on Earth, with a fossil record dating back over 450 million years.\n\nThe Atlantic horseshoe crab has a distinctive, dome-shaped carapace (upper shell) that can reach up to 60 centimeters (24 inches) in length. It has a long, spike-like telson (tail) that it uses for steering and stability. The species has a total of 10 appendages, including a pair of chelicerae (claw-like appendages) and five pairs of legs.\n\nHorseshoe crabs are known for their unique blue blood, which contains a copper-based respiratory pigment called hemocyanin. This blood is widely used in the biomedical industry for the detection of bacterial endotoxins.\n\nThese arthropods are found primarily along the Atlantic coast of North America, from Maine to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. They play a crucial role in the ecosystem, serving as an important food source for various species, including migratory birds, and contributing to the overall health of coastal habitats.\n\nDue to their ecological importance and vulnerability to human activities, such as overharvesting and habitat loss, the Atlantic horseshoe crab is considered a species of conservation concern in many regions.",
