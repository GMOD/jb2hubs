  "description": "Plasmodium inui San Antonio 1 is a species of malaria parasite that infects macaque monkeys. It is a protozoan parasite that belongs to the genus Plasmodium, which includes the various species of malaria parasites that infect both humans and other vertebrate hosts.\n\nPlasmodium inui San Antonio 1 was first isolated from a cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) in San Antonio, Texas, United States. It is closely related to other Plasmodium species that infect various primate hosts, such as P. coatneyi and P. fieldi, which also infect macaque monkeys.\n\nLike other Plasmodium species, P. inui San Antonio 1 has a complex life cycle that involves both a vertebrate host (the macaque monkey) and an invertebrate host (the Anopheles mosquito). The parasite is transmitted to the monkey host through the bite of an infected mosquito, where it then undergoes development and replication within the host's red blood cells, leading to the characteristic symptoms of malaria.\n\nP. inui San Antonio 1 is an important model organism for studying the biology and pathogenesis of malaria infections in non-human primate hosts, as well as for the development and testing of potential antimalarial drugs and vaccines.",
