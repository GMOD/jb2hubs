  "description": "Kuraishia capsulata CBS 1993 is a yeast species that belongs to the genus Kuraishia. It is a member of the family Saccharomycetaceae, which is part of the phylum Ascomycota.\n\nK. capsulata is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically ovoid or spherical in shape, measuring around 3-6 Î¼m in diameter. The species is known to produce ascospores, which are formed within asci, the specialized reproductive structures in ascomycete fungi.\n\nKuraishia capsulata CBS 1993 was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Japan. It is known to be able to assimilate a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, and can grow in a range of temperature and pH conditions.\n\nThis yeast species has been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, such as in the production of biofuels, enzymes, and other valuable compounds. Additionally, its unique physiological and genetic characteristics make it an interesting model organism for research in yeast biology and evolution.",
