  "description": "Eurytemora carolleeae is a species of calanoid copepod, a type of small crustacean, found in estuarine and coastal environments. It belongs to the genus Eurytemora, which is known for its adaptability to a wide range of salinities.\n\nThis species was first described in 2003 and named after Carollee Haibach, a prominent figure in the study of estuarine zooplankton. Eurytemora carolleeae is typically found in the upper reaches of estuaries, where it plays a crucial role in the aquatic food web as a link between primary producers (such as phytoplankton) and higher trophic levels, including fish and other predators.\n\nMorphologically, Eurytemora carolleeae is characterized by its segmented body, antennae, and swimming legs, which are typical features of calanoid copepods. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males and females displaying distinct morphological differences, particularly in their antennae and reproductive organs.\n\nThe ecology and life cycle of Eurytemora carolleeae are closely tied to the dynamic estuarine environment, with factors such as salinity, temperature, and food availability influencing its distribution, abundance, and reproductive patterns. Understanding the role and dynamics of this species in estuarine ecosystems is important for the overall understanding and management of these complex and ecologically valuable systems.",
