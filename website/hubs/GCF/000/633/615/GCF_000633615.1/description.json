  "description": "Poecilia reticulata, commonly known as the guppy, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the family Poeciliidae. It is native to northeastern South America, particularly the coastal regions of Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and northern Brazil.\n\nGuppies are known for their vibrant and diverse coloration patterns, with males typically displaying more elaborate and colorful fins and body markings compared to the relatively drab females. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males being smaller and more colorful than females.\n\nGuppies are livebearers, meaning they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The females can store sperm and reproduce multiple times without further mating, giving birth to broods of up to 200 tiny, fully-formed offspring.\n\nGuppies are widely distributed and adaptable, able to thrive in a variety of aquatic habitats, including slow-moving streams, ponds, and even brackish waters. They are omnivorous, feeding on a diverse range of aquatic plants, algae, and small invertebrates.\n\nDue to their hardy nature, small size, and vibrant colors, guppies are one of the most popular aquarium fish species and are widely kept by hobbyists around the world. They have also been used extensively in scientific research, particularly in the fields of genetics, behavior, and evolutionary biology.",
