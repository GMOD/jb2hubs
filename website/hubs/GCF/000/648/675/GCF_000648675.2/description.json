  "description": "Cimex lectularius, commonly known as the bed bug, is a small, wingless insect that belongs to the order Hemiptera. These insects are obligate blood-feeding parasites that primarily feed on human hosts, though they can also feed on other warm-blooded animals.\n\nCimex lectularius have a flattened, oval-shaped body and range in size from 4 to 7 millimeters in length. They have a reddish-brown color and possess a proboscis, which they use to pierce the skin and feed on blood. These insects are nocturnal and typically hide in cracks, crevices, and other secluded areas during the day, emerging at night to feed on their hosts.\n\nBed bugs undergo a simple metamorphosis, with the life cycle consisting of egg, nymph, and adult stages. Females can lay up to 500 eggs during their lifespan, which hatch in about 6 to 17 days, depending on environmental conditions. Nymphs must molt through five instars before reaching adulthood, a process that can take several weeks to several months.\n\nCimex lectularius are known for their ability to survive for long periods without feeding and their resistance to many insecticides, making them a persistent and challenging pest to control. Their bites can cause skin irritation, allergic reactions, and, in some cases, secondary infections in humans.",
