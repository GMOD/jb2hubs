  "description": "Centruroides sculpturatus, commonly known as the Arizona bark scorpion, is a species of scorpion native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Buthidae, which includes some of the most venomous scorpion species in the world.\n\nThe Arizona bark scorpion is a small to medium-sized scorpion, typically reaching a length of 2.5 to 3.5 inches (6.4 to 8.9 cm). It has a distinctive appearance, with a flattened body and a pale yellow to light brown color, often with dark brown or black markings on its carapace and metasoma (tail). The species is named for the intricate, sculptured patterns on its exoskeleton, which help it blend in with the bark of trees and rocky environments it inhabits.\n\nCentruroides sculpturatus is known for its potent neurotoxic venom, which can cause severe pain, muscle spasms, and respiratory distress in humans. However, fatalities from its sting are rare, and most cases can be managed with appropriate medical treatment. The species is typically found in dry, arid regions, where it inhabits crevices, under rocks, and in the bark of trees, actively hunting for small prey such as insects and other arthropods.",
