  "description": "Ursus maritimus, commonly known as the polar bear, is a large, white-furred marine mammal that inhabits the Arctic region. It is the largest living land carnivore, with adult males weighing up to 800 kg (1,760 lbs).\n\nPolar bears are well-adapted to their harsh, icy environment. Their thick fur and layer of fat provide excellent insulation, and their large paws act as natural snowshoes, enabling them to move efficiently across the frozen tundra. They are excellent swimmers, using their large front paws to propel themselves through the water.\n\nThe primary prey of polar bears is seals, particularly ringed seals and bearded seals, which they hunt from the sea ice. They use their sharp sense of smell to locate their prey and their powerful jaws and claws to kill and consume them.\n\nPolar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend a significant portion of their time on the sea ice, where they hunt, mate, and raise their young. However, they are also considered terrestrial mammals, as they come ashore to rest, den, and occasionally forage for other food sources.\n\nDue to the effects of climate change, polar bear populations are facing significant threats, as the sea ice they depend on for hunting and breeding is diminishing at an alarming rate. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this iconic Arctic species.",
