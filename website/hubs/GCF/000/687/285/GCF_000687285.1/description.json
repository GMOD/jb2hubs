  "description": "Phaethon lepturus, commonly known as the White-tailed Tropicbird, is a seabird species belonging to the Phaethontidae family. These birds are characterized by their long, slender tails and graceful, buoyant flight patterns.\n\nThe White-tailed Tropicbird is a medium-sized bird, with an average length of around 40-45 cm, including its elongated tail feathers. They have a predominantly white plumage, with black markings on the wings and a distinctive red or orange bill. Their long, streamlined tails can reach up to twice the length of their body, making them a distinctive and elegant sight in the skies.\n\nThese birds are found in tropical and subtropical regions, primarily in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They are known for their impressive aerial displays and courtship rituals, often soaring high above the ocean's surface before plunging into the water to catch their prey, which consists mainly of small fish, squid, and crustaceans.\n\nPhaethon lepturus is considered a pelagic species, spending most of its time at sea and only returning to land to breed on remote, rocky islands or cliffs. They are known to form monogamous pairs and nest in small colonies, laying a single egg in a simple scrape or crevice on the ground.\n\nOverall, the White-tailed Tropicbird is a remarkable seabird species, adapted to the challenges of the open ocean and known for its impressive aerial acrobatics and unique physical features.",
