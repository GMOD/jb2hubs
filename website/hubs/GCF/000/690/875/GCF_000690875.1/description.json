  "description": "Gavia stellata, commonly known as the red-throated loon or red-throated diver, is a species of diving bird belonging to the family Gaviidae. It is a medium-sized loon with a slender, pointed bill and a distinctive red throat patch during the breeding season.\n\nGavia stellata is widely distributed across the Northern Hemisphere, breeding in the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. It spends the non-breeding season in coastal areas and inland waters, often near estuaries, bays, and sheltered waters.\n\nThis species is an excellent swimmer and diver, using its large webbed feet to propel itself underwater in pursuit of small fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic prey. Gavia stellata is known for its haunting, wailing calls, which can be heard both on the breeding grounds and during migration.\n\nGavia stellata is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as its population is considered stable and widespread. However, it faces threats from oil spills, habitat degradation, and climate change, which can impact its breeding and wintering grounds.",
