  "description": "Brassica oleracea var. oleracea, commonly known as wild cabbage, is a subspecies of the Brassica oleracea species. It is a biennial plant that is native to the western and central Mediterranean region, including the coastal areas of the United Kingdom and France.\n\nWild cabbage is the progenitor of many cultivated Brassica vegetables, including cabbage, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts. It is a hardy plant that can grow in a variety of soil types and climates, and it is known for its thick, waxy leaves and compact, leafy head.\n\nThe plant typically grows to a height of 60-120 cm and produces yellow flowers that develop into long, slender seed pods. Wild cabbage is rich in essential nutrients, including vitamins C, K, and B6, as well as minerals such as calcium, iron, and magnesium.\n\nThis subspecies of Brassica oleracea is an important genetic resource for the breeding and improvement of cultivated Brassica vegetables, as it possesses a wide range of genetic diversity and valuable traits that can be selectively bred into modern crop varieties.",
