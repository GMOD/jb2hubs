  "description": "Agrilus planipennis, commonly known as the emerald ash borer (EAB), is a species of metallic wood-boring beetle native to Asia. It is considered a major invasive pest that has caused significant damage to ash tree populations in North America and Europe.\n\nThe emerald ash borer is a small, slender beetle, measuring around 8-14 millimeters in length. Its distinctive features include a metallic, emerald-green body and a flattened, elongated shape. The adults have a characteristic v-shaped abdominal segment and antennae that are serrated.\n\nThe larvae of the emerald ash borer are wood-boring insects that feed on the inner bark and cambium of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients. This feeding activity can ultimately lead to the tree's death within a few years of infestation.\n\nThe beetle's life cycle typically takes one to two years to complete, depending on environmental conditions. Adult beetles emerge from the tree bark in the spring and summer, feeding on the leaves of ash trees before mating and laying their eggs in the bark crevices.\n\nThe emerald ash borer has become a significant threat to ash tree populations in North America and Europe, where it has been accidentally introduced and has spread rapidly, causing widespread tree mortality. Effective management strategies, such as early detection, tree removal, and the use of biological control agents, are crucial in mitigating the impact of this invasive pest.",
