  "description": "Antrostomus carolinensis, commonly known as the Chuck-will's-widow, is a nocturnal bird species belonging to the nightjar family, Caprimulgidae. This medium-sized bird is native to the southeastern United States and parts of the Caribbean.\n\nThe Chuck-will's-widow is known for its distinctive call, which consists of the repeated phrase \"chuck-will's-widow\" that can be heard at night. It has a large, flattened head, a small beak, and a wide, gaping mouth that helps it capture flying insects, its primary food source.\n\nThe species has a camouflaged plumage, typically brownish-gray in color, which helps it blend in with the bark of trees and other natural environments. It spends the day resting on the ground or on low branches, becoming active at dusk to hunt for insects.\n\nAntrostomus carolinensis is a migratory bird, with individuals spending the breeding season in the southeastern United States and wintering in the Caribbean and Central America. The species plays an important role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitats.",
