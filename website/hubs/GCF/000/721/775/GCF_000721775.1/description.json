  "description": "Aureobasidium melanogenum CBS 110374 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the genus Aureobasidium. It is a member of the phylum Ascomycota, which is the largest phylum of fungi.\n\nAureobasidium melanogenum is characterized by its ability to produce melanin, a dark pigment, which gives the fungus a distinctive black or dark brown appearance. The fungus can grow on a variety of substrates, including plant materials, soil, and water.\n\nMorphologically, Aureobasidium melanogenum forms yeast-like cells that can undergo budding reproduction. The cells can also produce hyphae, which are long, branching filamentous structures typical of many fungi.\n\nGenetically, Aureobasidium melanogenum has been studied and its genome has been sequenced. This has provided insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying its pigment production and other physiological properties.\n\nEcologically, Aureobasidium melanogenum is often found in association with plants and can play a role in the degradation of plant materials. It has also been studied for its potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of enzymes or biofuels.",
