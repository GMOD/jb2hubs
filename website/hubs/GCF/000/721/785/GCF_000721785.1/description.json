  "description": "Aureobasidium pullulans EXF-150 is a strain of the fungal species Aureobasidium pullulans, which is a yeast-like fungus commonly found in various environmental niches, such as on plant surfaces, in soil, and in aquatic environments.\n\nAureobasidium pullulans EXF-150 is a well-studied strain that has been isolated from environmental sources, such as hypersaline environments. This strain is known for its ability to produce the extracellular polysaccharide pullulan, which has various industrial and biotechnological applications.\n\nThe cells of Aureobasidium pullulans EXF-150 are typically ellipsoidal or elongated in shape and can exhibit dimorphism, transitioning between a yeast-like form and a filamentous, mycelial form, depending on environmental conditions. The strain is capable of growing in a wide range of pH, temperature, and salinity conditions, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse ecological niches.\n\nAureobasidium pullulans EXF-150 has been the subject of extensive research due to its potential applications in areas such as biofuel production, bioremediation, and the development of novel biomaterials. Its ability to produce pullulan and other valuable metabolites has made it an attractive model organism for both academic and industrial research.",
