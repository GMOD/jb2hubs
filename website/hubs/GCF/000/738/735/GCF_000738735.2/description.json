  "description": "Corvus cornix cornix, commonly known as the hooded crow or Carrion Crow, is a subspecies of the Carrion Crow (Corvus corone) that is found in parts of Europe and Asia. It is a medium-sized member of the crow family, Corvidae.\n\nThe hooded crow has a distinctive appearance, with a dark grey body and black head, wings, and tail. This coloration pattern gives it the appearance of wearing a \"hood.\" The beak, legs, and feet are also black. The subspecies is slightly smaller than the nominate Carrion Crow subspecies.\n\nHooded crows are highly intelligent and adaptable birds, known for their problem-solving abilities and opportunistic foraging behaviors. They thrive in a variety of habitats, including urban, rural, and forested areas. Their diet is omnivorous, consisting of carrion, insects, small vertebrates, plant matter, and even human refuse.\n\nThese crows are considered to be important ecosystem regulators, playing a role in controlling populations of smaller animals and scavenging on carcasses. They are also known for their complex social behaviors and vocalizations, which include a distinctive \"caw\" call.\n\nThe hooded crow subspecies is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, with populations found from Scandinavia to Central Asia. Its conservation status is currently classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
