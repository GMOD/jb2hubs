  "description": "Bison bison bison, commonly known as the American bison or the Plains bison, is a subspecies of the American bison (Bison bison) that is native to the Great Plains region of North America. This large, shaggy-haired bovine is the largest land mammal in North America, with adult males (bulls) typically weighing between 800 and 2,000 pounds (360 to 900 kilograms).\n\nThe American bison is characterized by its distinctive hump over the shoulders, which is formed by the elongated vertebrae and muscles that support the animal's massive head and horns. The bison's thick, woolly coat helps insulate it from the harsh winter conditions of its native habitat, which includes grasslands, prairies, and open woodlands.\n\nBison bison bison is a grazing herbivore, feeding primarily on grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous vegetation. They are well-adapted to their environment, with their sturdy, muscular build and sharp horns allowing them to defend themselves against predators, such as wolves and grizzly bears.\n\nOnce a dominant species across the Great Plains, the American bison population was severely reduced in the late 19th century due to overhunting and habitat loss. Conservation efforts have helped to restore the species, though it remains classified as \"Near Threatened\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
