  "description": "Hyalella azteca is a small freshwater amphipod crustacean species that is widely distributed in North America. It is commonly known as the freshwater scud or side-swimmer.\n\nHyalella azteca is typically less than 10 millimeters in length and has a laterally compressed body with seven pairs of walking legs. It is a detritivore, feeding on decaying organic matter and algae in the aquatic environments it inhabits, such as lakes, ponds, streams, and wetlands.\n\nThis species plays an important role in aquatic food webs, serving as a food source for various predators, including fish, amphibians, and aquatic birds. Hyalella azteca is also commonly used as a model organism in ecotoxicological studies due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants and its widespread distribution.\n\nThe species is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, including changes in pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen levels, making it a resilient and adaptable component of freshwater ecosystems across the continent.",
