  "description": "Pimelobacter simplex is a species of bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccus-shaped bacterium. Pimelobacter simplex is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism.\n\nThis bacterium was first isolated from soil samples and is known to be found in various environmental habitats, such as soil and sediments. Pimelobacter simplex is considered a saprophytic bacterium, meaning it feeds on dead or decaying organic matter in its natural environment.\n\nGenetically, Pimelobacter simplex has a relatively small genome size compared to many other bacteria. It has been studied for its potential applications in various fields, such as bioremediation, due to its ability to degrade certain organic compounds.\n\nOverall, Pimelobacter simplex is a relatively simple and understudied bacterium that has been found in various terrestrial environments and may possess some interesting metabolic capabilities worth further exploration.",
