  "description": "Bactrocera dorsalis, commonly known as the Oriental fruit fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly native to Asia. It is considered a major agricultural pest, as the larvae feed on a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, causing significant economic damage to crops.\n\nThe adult fly is typically 6-8 millimeters in length, with a yellowish-brown body and transparent wings. The most distinctive feature is the dark brown or black stripe running along the back (dorsal) surface of the thorax, which gives the species its name.\n\nBactrocera dorsalis has a high reproductive potential, with females capable of laying up to 300 eggs in their lifetime. The eggs are laid under the skin of host fruits, and the larvae feed on the flesh, often causing the fruit to rot and drop prematurely.\n\nThe species is highly adaptable and has spread to many regions outside its native range, including parts of Africa, the Middle East, and the Pacific islands. Its presence in these areas has led to strict quarantine measures and control programs to prevent the further spread and economic damage caused by this invasive pest.\n\nOngoing research focuses on developing effective management strategies, such as the use of bait sprays, sterile insect technique, and biological control methods, to mitigate the impact of Bactrocera dorsalis on agricultural production.",
