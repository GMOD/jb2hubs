  "description": "Arachis duranensis is a wild peanut species that belongs to the genus Arachis, which is part of the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to Bolivia and Argentina, where it can be found growing in dry, sandy or rocky habitats.\n\nArachis duranensis is a perennial, prostrate herb that produces small, yellow flowers. The plant has a well-developed taproot system and typically grows close to the ground. The leaves are compound, with 2-4 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces underground, peg-like structures known as cleistogamous flowers, which self-pollinate and develop into small, indehiscent fruits called \"peanuts\" or \"groundnuts.\"\n\nArachis duranensis is considered a valuable genetic resource for peanut breeding and improvement programs. It possesses several desirable traits, such as resistance to various diseases and pests, as well as tolerance to abiotic stresses like drought and high temperatures. Researchers have used this wild species to introduce beneficial characteristics into cultivated peanut varieties through hybridization and introgression breeding techniques.",
