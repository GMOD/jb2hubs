  "description": "Rickettsia asembonensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Rickettsia. It is a gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium that is primarily transmitted by ticks. Rickettsia asembonensis was first discovered in 2013 from ticks collected in Asembo, Kenya, and was named after the location of its discovery.\n\nThe bacterium is known to infect a variety of tick species, including Amblyomma ticks, and has been detected in several parts of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Rickettsia asembonensis is considered a member of the spotted fever group of Rickettsia, which are known to cause various diseases in humans and animals.\n\nWhile the pathogenicity of Rickettsia asembonensis to humans is not yet fully understood, it is an important subject of study due to its potential implications for public health, particularly in regions where it has been detected. Further research is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology, ecology, and clinical significance of this Rickettsia species.",
