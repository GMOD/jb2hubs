  "description": "Exophiala oligosperma is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Exophiala, which is a member of the family Herpotrichiellaceae within the phylum Ascomycota. It is a dark-colored, dematiaceous fungus that is known to be a human opportunistic pathogen.\n\nExophiala oligosperma is characterized by its ability to produce dark, melanized hyphae and conidia (asexual spores). The fungus can grow at a wide range of temperatures, including those encountered in the human body, which allows it to potentially cause infections in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThis species has been reported to cause various types of infections, including skin and soft tissue infections, as well as disseminated and systemic infections in individuals with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems. Its ability to adapt to different environments and potential to cause opportunistic infections makes Exophiala oligosperma an important subject of study in the field of medical mycology.",
