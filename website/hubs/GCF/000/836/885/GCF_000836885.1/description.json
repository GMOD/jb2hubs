  "description": "Adeno-associated virus-4 (AAV-4) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Dependovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. AAV-4 is considered a helper-dependent virus, meaning it requires the presence of a helper virus, such as an adenovirus or herpes virus, to replicate efficiently.\n\nThe AAV-4 genome is approximately 4.7 kilobases in length and contains two main open reading frames (ORFs): the rep gene, which encodes proteins involved in viral replication and integration, and the cap gene, which encodes the viral capsid proteins.\n\nUnlike some other AAV serotypes, AAV-4 has a relatively narrow host range and exhibits tropism for specific cell types, such as certain epithelial cells and neuronal cells. This unique tropism is determined by the specific interactions between the AAV-4 capsid and cellular receptors on the target cells.\n\nAAV-4 has been investigated for its potential use in gene therapy applications due to its ability to efficiently deliver genetic material to target cells and its relatively low immunogenicity compared to other viral vectors. Ongoing research continues to explore the applications and characteristics of this versatile virus.",
