  "description": "Betapolyomavirus macacae is a species of virus that belongs to the Betapolyomavirus genus within the Polyomaviridae family. It was first identified in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), a species of Old World monkey native to Asia.\n\nBetapolyomavirus macacae is a small, non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid structure. Its genome consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule, which is typically around 5 kilobases in size. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the large T antigen and small T antigen, which play crucial roles in the viral replication and host cell transformation processes.\n\nThis virus is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract and lymphoid tissues of its natural host, the rhesus macaque. While the exact pathogenic mechanisms and potential for cross-species transmission are still under investigation, Betapolyomavirus macacae is known to be capable of establishing persistent infections in its host, which may have implications for the health and ecology of primate populations.",
