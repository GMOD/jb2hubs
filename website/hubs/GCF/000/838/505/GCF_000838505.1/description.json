  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 60 (HPV-60) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which consists of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HPV-60 is classified within the genus Gammapapillomavirus, which primarily infects the skin and mucous membranes of humans.\n\nHPV-60 is typically associated with the development of common warts, also known as verrucae vulgaris, on the hands and feet. These warts are typically benign and self-limiting, though they can be persistent and recur in some individuals. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected skin or by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nThe genome of HPV-60 is approximately 7,800 base pairs in length and encodes several essential genes, including those responsible for viral replication, gene expression, and the production of structural proteins that form the viral capsid. The virus replicates within the basal layer of the epidermis, where it can induce cellular proliferation and the formation of the characteristic warty lesions.\n\nWhile HPV-60 is generally considered a low-risk type of human papillomavirus, it can occasionally be associated with more severe skin conditions, such as epidermodysplasia verruciformis, a rare genetic disorder that predisposes individuals to widespread, persistent warts and an increased risk of skin cancer.",
