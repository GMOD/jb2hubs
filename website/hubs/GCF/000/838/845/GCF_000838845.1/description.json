  "description": "Gallid alphaherpesvirus 3, also known as Marek's disease virus (MDV-3), is a highly contagious and economically significant member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily within the Herpesviridae family. It is the causative agent of Marek's disease, a lymphoproliferative disorder primarily affecting chickens and other galliform birds.\n\nMDV-3 is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 180 kilobase pairs. The virus is highly cell-associated and primarily infects T lymphocytes, leading to the transformation and proliferation of these cells, resulting in the development of tumors in various organs.\n\nThe virus is transmitted horizontally, primarily through the inhalation of infectious dust or dander containing the virus. It can also be transmitted vertically from infected parent birds to their offspring. MDV-3 has a complex life cycle, involving both lytic and latent phases, which allows the virus to persist in the host and evade the immune response.\n\nMarek's disease is a significant concern in the poultry industry, as it can lead to significant economic losses due to increased mortality, reduced egg production, and the need for extensive vaccination programs. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of MDV-3 is crucial for the development of effective prevention and control strategies.",
