  "description": "Lumpy skin disease virus NI-2490 is a member of the Capripoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects cattle and water buffaloes.\n\nThe virus causes a disease known as lumpy skin disease, which is characterized by the development of nodular skin lesions, fever, reduced milk production, and sometimes death in affected animals. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, mechanical vectors such as flies, and contaminated fomites.\n\nNI-2490 is a specific strain or isolate of the lumpy skin disease virus that was identified and sequenced in a particular region or outbreak. The genetic and phenotypic characteristics of this strain may differ slightly from other strains, but it shares the core features and pathogenicity of the Lumpy skin disease virus species.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance of this virus are important for understanding its epidemiology, developing effective diagnostic tests and vaccines, and implementing appropriate control measures to prevent the spread of this economically significant livestock disease.",
