  "description": "Ectromelia virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that is the causative agent of mousepox, a serious disease affecting mice and other rodents.\n\nThe Ectromelia virus has a large, complex, brick-shaped virion structure that measures approximately 200-400 nanometers in length. The genome consists of a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule that is approximately 170 kilobase pairs in size.\n\nEctromelia virus primarily infects and replicates within the cytoplasm of host cells, particularly in the liver, spleen, and lymphoid tissues of infected mice. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact, inhalation of aerosolized particles, or ingestion of contaminated food or water.\n\nInfection with Ectromelia virus can lead to severe clinical symptoms in mice, including skin lesions, hemorrhage, necrosis, and potentially fatal systemic disease. The virus has been extensively studied as a model for understanding the host-pathogen interactions and immune responses involved in poxvirus infections.",
