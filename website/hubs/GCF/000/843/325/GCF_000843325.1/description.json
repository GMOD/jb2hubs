  "description": "Molluscum contagiosum virus subtype 1 (MCV-1) is a member of the Poxviridae family, specifically the genus Molluscipoxvirus. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that is responsible for causing the skin condition known as molluscum contagiosum.\n\nMCV-1 is the most common subtype of the molluscum contagiosum virus, and it primarily infects the skin, causing the development of small, round, pearly-white or flesh-colored lesions. These lesions are typically painless and can occur on any part of the body, but they are most commonly found on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities.\n\nThe virus is transmitted through direct contact with the lesions or contaminated surfaces, and it is particularly prevalent in children and individuals with weakened immune systems. MCV-1 infection can lead to the development of multiple lesions, and the virus can remain dormant in the skin for extended periods before reactivating and causing new outbreaks.\n\nWhile MCV-1 infection is generally not considered a serious medical condition, it can be persistent and can cause cosmetic concerns, especially in visible areas of the body. Treatment options include topical medications, cryotherapy, and other approaches aimed at removing or inactivating the viral lesions.",
