  "description": "Orf virus, also known as contagious ecthyma or \"sore mouth,\" is a zoonotic virus that primarily infects sheep and goats. It belongs to the Parapoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family.\n\nThe Orf virus is a double-stranded DNA virus with a circular genome. It is an enveloped virus with a characteristic oval or brick-shaped morphology when observed under an electron microscope. The virus primarily replicates in the epithelial cells of the host, causing the development of characteristic skin lesions.\n\nInfection with Orf virus typically results in the formation of papules, pustules, and proliferative lesions on the lips, muzzle, and other areas of the skin in sheep and goats. In humans, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, leading to localized skin lesions, often on the hands or fingers.\n\nThe Orf virus is considered a relatively self-limiting infection, and the majority of cases in both animals and humans resolve within a few weeks to a month. However, in some instances, the infection can lead to more severe complications, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Preventive measures, such as proper hygiene and personal protective equipment, are important in reducing the risk of transmission from infected animals to humans.",
