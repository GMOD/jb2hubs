  "description": "Human betaherpesvirus 5, also known as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), is a species of the Cytomegalovirus genus within the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily of the Herpesviridae family. It is a large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects human cells.\n\nHCMV is ubiquitous, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 40% to 100% in the adult population, depending on geographic location and socioeconomic status. Primary infection typically occurs early in life and is often asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals. However, HCMV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, and newborns.\n\nThe virus has a broad tissue tropism and can establish lifelong latent infections, predominantly in cells of the myeloid lineage. Reactivation of latent HCMV can occur, leading to reinfection and potential disease manifestations. HCMV infection has been associated with various clinical conditions, including congenital abnormalities, retinitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nHCMV remains an important public health concern, and research continues to focus on understanding its complex biology, developing effective antiviral therapies, and exploring strategies for vaccine development to prevent and control HCMV-related diseases.",
