  "description": "Adeno-associated virus - 7 (AAV-7) is a small, non-enveloped virus that belongs to the Dependoparvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It is a single-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 4.7 kilobases.\n\nAAV-7 is classified as a serotype of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) family, which are known for their ability to infect a wide range of host cells and their potential use as gene therapy vectors. Unlike many other viruses, AAV-7 requires the presence of a helper virus, such as an adenovirus or herpesvirus, for its efficient replication and propagation.\n\nThe unique features of AAV-7 include its ability to transduce a variety of cell types, including muscle, liver, and central nervous system cells, making it a promising candidate for targeted gene delivery applications. The virus has been studied for its potential use in gene therapy, where it could be employed to deliver therapeutic genes to specific target tissues or organs.\n\nResearch on AAV-7 continues to explore its biology, tropism, and potential applications in the field of gene therapy and genetic engineering, contributing to the advancement of our understanding of this versatile virus and its potential in various biomedical applications.",
