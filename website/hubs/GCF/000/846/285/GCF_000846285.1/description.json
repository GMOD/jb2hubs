  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 92 (HPV-92) is a member of the Alphapapillomavirus genus within the Papillomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that infects the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes in humans.\n\nHPV-92 is classified as a low-risk type of human papillomavirus, which means it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. However, it can still lead to the formation of benign skin warts or papillomas, particularly in the anogenital region.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV-92 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The genome encodes several early (E) and late (L) genes that are responsible for viral replication, gene expression, and the production of viral structural proteins.\n\nInfection with HPV-92 is relatively common and is typically acquired through skin-to-skin contact or sexual contact. It is considered a common member of the human skin microbiome, and most individuals infected with HPV-92 do not develop any noticeable clinical symptoms.\n\nThe diagnosis of HPV-92 infection is typically made through molecular detection methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or in situ hybridization, which can identify the presence of the viral genetic material in clinical samples. Treatment for HPV-92-associated lesions may involve various approaches, including cryotherapy, laser therapy, or topical antiviral medications.",
