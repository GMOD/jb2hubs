  "description": "Human mastadenovirus F is a species of adenovirus that primarily infects humans. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that belong to the Mastadenovirus genus within the Adenoviridae family.\n\nThe Human mastadenovirus F species is characterized by a distinct genomic sequence and serological properties compared to other adenovirus species. Viruses within this species commonly cause respiratory infections, such as the common cold, as well as other clinical manifestations like conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and occasionally more severe conditions in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe virus particle is approximately 70-100 nanometers in diameter and has an icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is linear, double-stranded DNA, typically ranging from 34 to 36 kilobase pairs in length. Human mastadenovirus F employs various mechanisms to evade the host's immune response and establish successful infection and replication within the host's cells.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of Human mastadenovirus F is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies, as adenovirus infections continue to pose a significant public health concern, particularly in certain vulnerable populations.",
