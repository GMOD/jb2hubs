  "description": "Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is a member of the family Iridoviridae, a group of large, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a variety of aquatic organisms, including fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. SGIV is known to primarily infect the giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus), a commercially important fish species found in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe SGIV genome is approximately 140-160 kilobase pairs in size and encodes for a diverse array of proteins involved in viral replication, structural components, and host-pathogen interactions. The virus particle has an icosahedral shape and is approximately 120-200 nanometers in diameter.\n\nSGIV is known to cause significant economic losses in aquaculture operations due to its ability to cause disease outbreaks in farmed grouper populations. Infection by SGIV can lead to high mortality rates, reduced growth, and other pathological changes in the infected fish. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of SGIV is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies to mitigate the impact of this virus on the aquaculture industry.",
