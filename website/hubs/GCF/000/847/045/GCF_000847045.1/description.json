  "description": "The Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1) is a member of the family Phycodnaviridae, which are large, icosahedral, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect eukaryotic algae. PBCV-1 is specifically known to infect the symbiotic green alga Chlorella, which is found within the freshwater ciliate Paramecium bursaria.\n\nPBCV-1 has a genome size of approximately 330,000 base pairs, making it one of the largest known viruses. The virus particle is approximately 190 nanometers in diameter and contains more than 700 genes, many of which are involved in viral DNA replication, transcription, and translation.\n\nUpon infection, PBCV-1 attaches to the host Chlorella cell wall and subsequently digests a portion of the wall, allowing the viral DNA to enter the host cell. Once inside, the viral genome takes control of the host's cellular machinery to produce new viral particles, which are then released upon lysis of the host cell.\n\nPBCV-1 is considered a model system for the study of large DNA viruses and their interactions with their eukaryotic hosts, particularly in the context of evolutionary relationships and the complex biochemical processes involved in viral replication and gene expression.",
