  "description": "Yaba-like disease virus (YADV) is a member of the genus Yatapoxvirus, which belongs to the family Poxviridae. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects Old World monkeys, such as macaques and baboons, and can occasionally infect humans.\n\nThe virus is known to cause a localized skin disease characterized by the formation of nodular lesions, typically on the face, neck, and extremities of the infected host. The disease is generally self-limiting in nature and often resolves within a few weeks to months without the need for specific treatment.\n\nYADV is believed to be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, or through the bite of an infected arthropod vector, such as a tick or mite. The virus can also be transmitted from person to person, though this is relatively uncommon.\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, YADV is of interest due to its potential use as a model for understanding the pathogenesis and host-virus interactions of other poxviruses, as well as its potential for development as a therapeutic agent or vaccine platform. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus's ability to infect and replicate within its host cells, and to explore its potential applications in the field of medicine.",
