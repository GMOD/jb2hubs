  "description": "Simian adenovirus 1 (SAdV-1) is a member of the Adenoviridae family, a group of non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses that contain a double-stranded DNA genome. SAdV-1 is a simian adenovirus, meaning it primarily infects non-human primates, such as Old World monkeys.\n\nThe viral capsid of SAdV-1 is composed of three main structural proteins: hexon, penton, and fiber. These proteins play crucial roles in viral attachment, entry, and host cell recognition. The viral genome of SAdV-1 is approximately 34-36 kilobase pairs in size and encodes various genes involved in viral replication, gene expression, and host cell manipulation.\n\nSAdV-1 has been isolated from various monkey species, including rhesus macaques, cynomolgus monkeys, and baboons. It can cause mild respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in its natural hosts, but is generally not considered a significant pathogen in healthy animals. However, SAdV-1 has been studied as a potential vector for the development of vaccine platforms and gene therapy applications, leveraging its ability to infect and transduce host cells.\n\nOverall, SAdV-1 is an important model system for understanding adenovirus biology and has potential applications in the fields of virology, immunology, and biotechnology.",
