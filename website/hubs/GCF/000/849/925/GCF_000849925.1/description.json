  "description": "Bunyamwera virus is a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a segmented genome consisting of three RNA segments: small (S), medium (M), and large (L).\n\nBunyamwera virus is considered the prototype virus of the Bunyaviridae family and is the causative agent of Bunyamwera fever, a mosquito-borne disease primarily affecting humans and livestock. The virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquito species and is found in various regions of Africa.\n\nInfection with Bunyamwera virus can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. In some cases, more severe complications, such as neurological manifestations, may occur. The virus can cause significant economic impact due to its potential to affect agricultural and livestock industries.\n\nOngoing research aims to further understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions for Bunyamwera virus infections, as it continues to pose a public health concern in affected regions.",
