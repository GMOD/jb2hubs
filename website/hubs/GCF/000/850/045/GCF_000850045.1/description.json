  "description": "Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV) is a member of the family Rhabdoviridae, genus Vesiculovirus. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects livestock, particularly horses, cattle, and swine.\n\nVSIV is the causative agent of vesicular stomatitis, a viral disease characterized by the formation of vesicles (blisters) on the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, lips, and coronary bands of the hooves. The virus can also infect humans, causing a flu-like illness with fever, muscle aches, and occasionally, vesicular lesions.\n\nThe viral genome of VSIV encodes five major structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). The glycoprotein (G) is responsible for binding to host cell receptors, allowing the virus to enter and infect the host cells.\n\nVSIV is primarily transmitted through the bites of infected insects, particularly sand flies and black flies, as well as through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated surfaces. The virus can also be transmitted between humans through close contact or exposure to infected materials.\n\nVesicular stomatitis caused by VSIV is an economically important disease in the livestock industry, as it can lead to trade restrictions and significant economic losses. Diagnosis of the disease is typically based on clinical signs, serological tests, and virus isolation. Prevention and control measures include vector control, movement restrictions, and vaccination, where available.",
