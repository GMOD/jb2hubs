  "description": "Mammarenavirus choriomeningitidis is a species of virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus, which is part of the family Arenaviridae. This virus is the causative agent of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, a rare but potentially serious viral infection in humans.\n\nMammarenavirus choriomeningitidis is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a segmented genome. The virus primarily infects rodents, particularly the common house mouse (Mus musculus), which serves as its natural reservoir. Humans can become infected through direct contact with infected rodents or their excreta, or by inhalation of aerosolized virus particles.\n\nThe virus targets the central nervous system, leading to the development of lymphocytic choriomeningitis, a condition characterized by symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, and in severe cases, meningitis or encephalitis. The virus can also cause fetal abnormalities if a pregnant woman becomes infected.\n\nDiagnosis of Mammarenavirus choriomeningitidis infection typically involves serological tests or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of clinical samples. Treatment is primarily supportive, with management of symptoms and prevention of complications. Vaccination is not currently available, so prevention relies on reducing exposure to infected rodents and their environments.",
