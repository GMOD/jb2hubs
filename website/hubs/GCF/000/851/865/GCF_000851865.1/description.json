  "description": "Uukuniemi virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Phlebovirus within the family Phenuiviridae. It is named after the Uukuniemi village in Finland, where the virus was first isolated in 1960 from ticks collected from small mammals.\n\nUukuniemi virus is primarily transmitted by ticks, particularly those of the genus Ixodes. The virus can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including rodents, small mammals, and birds, but it does not typically cause severe disease in humans. In rare cases, it may cause mild, self-limiting febrile illness in humans.\n\nThe genome of Uukuniemi virus consists of three segments, designated as S (small), M (medium), and L (large), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, the glycoprotein precursor, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cells and utilizes the cellular machinery for its own propagation.\n\nUukuniemi virus is considered an important model system for the study of Phlebovirus biology and the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies against related viruses, which can cause more severe diseases in humans, such as Rift Valley fever and Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS).",
