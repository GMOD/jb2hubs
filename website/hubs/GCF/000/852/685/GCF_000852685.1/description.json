  "description": "Henipavirus hendraense is a member of the Henipavirus genus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. Henipavirus hendraense is named after the Hendra virus, which was first identified in Australia in 1994.\n\nThe Henipavirus hendraense virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. It has a genome of approximately 18,000 nucleotides and encodes six main structural proteins: nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), attachment protein (G), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L).\n\nHenipavirus hendraense primarily infects fruit bats, particularly those in the Pteropus genus, which are considered the natural reservoir for the virus. Transmission to humans can occur through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, or through the consumption of contaminated food or water.\n\nInfection with Henipavirus hendraense can lead to severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological diseases in humans, with high mortality rates. The virus has the potential to cause outbreaks and has been the subject of significant public health concern and research efforts to understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential for prevention and treatment.",
