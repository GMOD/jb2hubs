  "description": "Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae is a virus species belonging to the genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae. This virus is the causative agent of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), a severe and potentially fatal viral hemorrhagic fever disease.\n\nThe Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae virion is enveloped and has a tripartite, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. The virus primarily infects ticks of the genus Hyalomma, which serve as the main reservoir and vector for transmission to humans and other vertebrate hosts.\n\nWhen transmitted to humans, the Orthonairovirus haemorrhagiae virus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, headache, back pain, joint pain, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In severe cases, it can lead to life-threatening hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nosebleeds, gum bleeding, and internal bleeding.\n\nThe virus is primarily found in regions of Africa, Asia, and Europe, where the Hyalomma ticks and their hosts are present. Prevention and control of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever rely on measures to reduce tick populations, protect against tick bites, and timely diagnosis and supportive care for infected individuals.",
