  "description": "Sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sand flies, particularly those of the Phlebotomus species.\n\nSFNV is the causative agent of sandfly fever, also known as \"three-day fever\" or \"Pappataci fever,\" a non-fatal, self-limiting illness characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, and malaise. The virus is prevalent in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia.\n\nUpon infection, the virus replicates in the host's cells, leading to the development of clinical symptoms typically within 3-6 days after exposure. The virus is primarily maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving sand flies and vertebrate hosts, such as rodents and humans.\n\nDiagnosis of SFNV infection typically involves serological tests, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or neutralization assays, to detect the presence of specific antibodies. Treatment for sandfly fever is generally supportive, focused on managing symptoms and providing rest and hydration, as the illness is usually self-limiting and resolves within a week.",
