  "description": "Orthohantavirus puumalaense is a species of hantavirus that primarily infects rodents, particularly bank voles (Myodes glareolus), in various parts of Europe. Hantaviruses are zoonotic viruses, meaning they can be transmitted from animals to humans, and Orthohantavirus puumalaense is the causative agent of a type of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) known as nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans.\n\nOrthohantavirus puumalaense is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus within the family Hantaviridae. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the inhalation of aerosolized rodent excreta, such as urine, feces, or saliva, or through direct contact with infected rodents or their nests.\n\nInfection with Orthohantavirus puumalaense in humans can lead to a milder form of HFRS, characterized by fever, headache, back and abdominal pain, and transient renal dysfunction. While Orthohantavirus puumalaense infections are generally less severe than those caused by other hantavirus species, they can still result in significant morbidity and, in rare cases, mortality.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance efforts are important for understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential public health impacts of Orthohantavirus puumalaense, as well as for developing effective prevention and control strategies.",
