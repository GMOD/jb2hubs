  "description": "Orthohantavirus sinnombreense is a type of hantavirus, a group of zoonotic viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents. The Orthohantavirus genus is part of the Hantaviridae family.\n\nOrthohantavirus sinnombreense is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that was first identified in the Sin Nombre virus (SNV) that causes Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPPS) in North America. The sinnombreense strain is believed to be a specific variant or genotype of the Sin Nombre virus, primarily found in certain rodent populations in geographical regions.\n\nLike other hantaviruses, Orthohantavirus sinnombreense is transmitted to humans mainly through inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine, droppings, or saliva. Infection with this virus can lead to HPPS, a severe and potentially fatal respiratory illness characterized by fluid buildup in the lungs.\n\nOngoing research continues to study the epidemiology, genetics, and public health implications of Orthohantavirus sinnombreense and other hantavirus strains to better understand their transmission dynamics and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
