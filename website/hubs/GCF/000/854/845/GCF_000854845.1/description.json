  "description": "Measles morbillivirus, also known as the measles virus, is a highly contagious single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus belonging to the Morbillivirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. It is the causative agent of the infectious disease measles, which is characterized by fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.\n\nThe measles virus has a pleomorphic structure, typically ranging from 120 to 300 nanometers in diameter. It contains a helical nucleocapsid and is surrounded by a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane during the budding process. The viral genome encodes six structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), hemagglutinin (H), and large polymerase protein (L).\n\nThe virus primarily infects the respiratory tract and spreads through direct contact with respiratory droplets or airborne transmission. After initial infection, the virus targets the immune system, particularly the lymphoid tissues, and can lead to a temporary immunosuppression, making the host more susceptible to other infections. Measles can cause severe complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems.\n\nVaccination with the measles vaccine has been a crucial public health measure in reducing the incidence and burden of measles globally. However, outbreaks can still occur, particularly in communities with low vaccination rates, highlighting the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent the spread of this highly contagious viral disease.",
