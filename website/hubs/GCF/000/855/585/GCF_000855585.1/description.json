  "description": "Sudan ebolavirus is a filovirus that belongs to the genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae. It is one of the six known species of the Ebolavirus genus, along with Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Ta√Ø Forest ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, and the recently discovered Bombali ebolavirus.\n\nThe Sudan ebolavirus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes a severe and often fatal disease in humans known as Sudan Ebola virus disease (Sudan EVD). The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or animals, such as bats or non-human primates.\n\nThe Sudan ebolavirus has a characteristic filamentous, pleomorphic shape and is approximately 80 nanometers in diameter and up to 14,000 nanometers in length. The viral genome consists of approximately 19,000 nucleotides and encodes seven structural proteins, including the glycoprotein, which plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect and replicate within host cells.\n\nOutbreaks of Sudan Ebola virus disease have occurred primarily in Central and East Africa, with the largest outbreaks recorded in Sudan and Uganda. The disease is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. Early recognition and supportive care are essential in managing the disease, as there are currently no approved vaccines or specific treatments for Sudan Ebola virus infection.",
