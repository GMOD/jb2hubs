  "description": "Human immunodeficiency virus 2 (HIV-2) is a retrovirus that belongs to the genus Lentivirus, a subgroup of the Retroviridae family. It is closely related to the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) found in sooty mangabey monkeys. HIV-2 is primarily found in West Africa and is less pathogenic and less transmissible than its counterpart, HIV-1.\n\nThe genome of HIV-2 is similar to that of HIV-1, encoding the essential structural and regulatory proteins required for viral replication and infection. However, HIV-2 has a lower rate of CD4+ T-cell depletion and a slower progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) compared to HIV-1. This is attributed to differences in the viral proteins and their interactions with the host's immune system.\n\nUnlike HIV-1, which is the predominant cause of the global HIV/AIDS pandemic, HIV-2 has a more limited geographical distribution and has not spread as widely. It is primarily transmitted through unprotected sexual contact, mother-to-child transmission, and exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\n\nThe diagnosis and management of HIV-2 infection involve specialized laboratory tests and clinical monitoring, as the immune response and treatment approaches may differ from those used for HIV-1 infection. Ongoing research aims to further understand the biology and epidemiology of HIV-2 to improve prevention and treatment strategies.",
