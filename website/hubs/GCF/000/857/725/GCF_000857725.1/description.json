  "description": "Yellow fever virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is primarily transmitted by infected Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti, and is the causative agent of the disease known as yellow fever.\n\nThe yellow fever virus genome consists of approximately 11,000 nucleotides and encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, pre-membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural proteins. The virus enters host cells through the interaction of the envelope protein with specific cellular receptors, leading to the internalization of the viral particle and the subsequent release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm.\n\nOnce inside the host cell, the viral genome hijacks the cellular machinery to replicate and produce new viral particles. The virus can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and, in severe cases, liver damage, bleeding, and organ failure. Yellow fever is a significant public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and South America, where the virus is endemic.\n\nPrevention and control of yellow fever rely on vaccination, mosquito control, and early diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals. The yellow fever vaccine is an effective and safe way to prevent the disease, and it is recommended for individuals living in or traveling to areas where the virus is present.",
