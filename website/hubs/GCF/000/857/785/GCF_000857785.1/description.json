  "description": "The European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV) is a member of the Lagovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and mountain hares (Lepus timidus).\n\nEBHSV is the causative agent of European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), an acute and often fatal viral disease in hares. The virus targets the liver, causing severe liver necrosis and hemorrhage, leading to rapid death in infected animals. The virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted through direct contact with infected hares or their excreta, as well as through indirect exposure to contaminated environments.\n\nEBHSV is of significant concern for wildlife management and conservation efforts, as it can have a significant impact on hare populations. The virus is known to be present in various regions of Europe, where it has been responsible for periodic outbreaks and population declines in hare species. Understanding the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of EBHSV is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate its impact on hare populations.",
