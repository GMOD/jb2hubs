  "description": "Human adenovirus 5 (HAdV-5) is a member of the Adenoviridae family, specifically belonging to the genus Mastadenovirus. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects human hosts.\n\nHAdV-5 is a common pathogen and is known to cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ocular infections in humans. The virus enters host cells by binding to the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) on the cell surface, which initiates the internalization process.\n\nOnce inside the host cell, the viral DNA is transported to the nucleus, where it hijacks the cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles. The newly assembled virions are then released from the host cell, ready to infect other cells and continue the viral replication cycle.\n\nHAdV-5 is a widely studied virus due to its potential use in gene therapy and vaccine development, as its genome can be engineered to deliver therapeutic genes or serve as a vector for delivering foreign antigens. However, the use of HAdV-5 in these applications is still an area of ongoing research and development, as the virus can elicit immune responses that may limit its effectiveness or safety.",
