  "description": "Human adenovirus 35 (HAdV-35) is a member of the Adenoviridae family, which are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with double-stranded DNA genomes. HAdV-35 belongs to the species Human mastadenovirus B, which includes several other adenovirus serotypes known to infect humans.\n\nHAdV-35 is considered an emerging pathogen and is associated with severe clinical manifestations, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The virus can cause a range of diseases, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and systemic infections in various organs.\n\nOne of the distinctive features of HAdV-35 is its ability to utilize the CD46 receptor, which is widely expressed on human cells, as the primary attachment receptor. This allows the virus to infect a broad range of cell types, contributing to its potential for causing severe and disseminated infections.\n\nHAdV-35 is considered an emerging threat, particularly in healthcare settings, where it has been associated with outbreaks among immunocompromised patients, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Understanding the epidemiology, molecular biology, and pathogenesis of HAdV-35 is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate its public health impact.",
