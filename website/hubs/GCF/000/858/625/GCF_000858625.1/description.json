  "description": "Human mastadenovirus D is a species of adenovirus that primarily infects humans. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that belong to the Adenoviridae family. The Human mastadenovirus D species is further classified into multiple serotypes, each with distinct genetic and antigenic properties.\n\nThe virions of Human mastadenovirus D are icosahedral in shape and measure approximately 70-90 nanometers in diameter. The viral genome is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule ranging from 34 to 36 kilobase pairs in length, encoding various structural and non-structural proteins essential for viral replication and host cell interactions.\n\nThese adenoviruses are known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and occasionally more severe systemic diseases, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The transmission of Human mastadenovirus D typically occurs through direct contact with infected individuals or exposure to contaminated surfaces or aerosolized respiratory droplets.\n\nOngoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of the different serotypes within the Human mastadenovirus D species, with the goal of developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
