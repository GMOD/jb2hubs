  "description": "Human picobirnavirus is a small, non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Picobirnaviridae family. It is primarily found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and is associated with various gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea and gastroenteritis.\n\nThe genome of the human picobirnavirus consists of two segments of double-stranded RNA, typically ranging from 1.9 to 2.6 kilobases in length. The viral particles are approximately 35-40 nanometers in diameter and have a characteristic bi-segmented genome, which is a distinguishing feature of the Picobirnaviridae family.\n\nHuman picobirnavirus is considered an emerging pathogen, and its role in human health and disease is not yet fully understood. While it has been detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, its precise contribution to gastrointestinal illnesses is still under investigation. Ongoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, transmission, and potential clinical significance of this virus in human populations.",
