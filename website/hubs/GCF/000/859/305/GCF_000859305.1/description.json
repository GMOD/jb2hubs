  "description": "Small anellovirus 1 is a virus species belonging to the Anelloviridae family. Anelloviruses are small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe small anellovirus 1 is characterized by its compact genome, typically ranging from 2 to 3.8 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes a limited number of proteins, primarily involved in replication and regulation of the viral life cycle. Anelloviruses, including small anellovirus 1, are known for their high genetic diversity and ability to establish persistent infections in their hosts.\n\nThe small anellovirus 1 has been detected in various human samples, such as blood, respiratory secretions, and fecal matter, suggesting it may be a common commensal or opportunistic virus in the human population. However, the specific role and clinical significance of small anellovirus 1 in human health and disease are still under investigation.",
