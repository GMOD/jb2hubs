  "description": "Human adenovirus 2 (HAdV-2) is a member of the Adenoviridae family, which are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HAdV-2 is a species C adenovirus, which is one of the most common types of adenoviruses that infect humans.\n\nThe virus particle is approximately 90-100 nanometers in diameter and has an icosahedral capsid structure. The genome of HAdV-2 is a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of around 36 kilobase pairs in length.\n\nHAdV-2 primarily infects the respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as common cold, bronchitis, and pneumonia. The virus can also cause conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, and other infections in some cases. Transmission typically occurs through direct contact with respiratory secretions or contaminated surfaces.\n\nHAdV-2 enters host cells by binding to the Coxsackie and Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) on the cell surface, followed by internalization and delivery of the viral genome into the nucleus. Once inside the host cell, the virus hijacks the cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles, which are then released to infect other cells.\n\nHAdV-2 infections are generally self-limiting in healthy individuals, but can be more severe in immunocompromised patients or those with underlying respiratory conditions. There are no specific treatments for HAdV-2 infections, and management typically involves supportive care and symptom relief.",
