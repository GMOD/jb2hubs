  "description": "Human mastadenovirus E is a species of adenovirus that primarily infects humans. Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that belong to the family Adenoviridae.\n\nThe human mastadenovirus E species is classified within the genus Mastadenovirus, which includes adenoviruses that infect mammalian hosts. This specific species is known to cause a variety of clinical manifestations in humans, including respiratory infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and occasionally, more severe illnesses.\n\nThe viral genome of human mastadenovirus E contains approximately 36 kilobase pairs of DNA, which encode for various structural and non-structural proteins essential for the virus's replication and pathogenesis. The virus utilizes host cellular machinery to replicate and produce new infectious particles, which can then be transmitted to other individuals through various routes, such as respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces.\n\nResearch on human mastadenovirus E has contributed to our understanding of adenoviral biology, epidemiology, and the development of potential therapeutic interventions, such as antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates, to prevent and manage adenoviral infections in human populations.",
