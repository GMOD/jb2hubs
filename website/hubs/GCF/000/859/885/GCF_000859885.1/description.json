  "description": "Variola virus, also known as the smallpox virus, is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a large, complex, double-stranded DNA virus that is the causative agent of the infectious disease smallpox.\n\nThe Variola virus particle is brick-shaped, measuring approximately 300 to 400 nanometers in length and 200 to 300 nanometers in width. The viral genome consists of a linear, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 185,000 base pairs, encoding around 200 genes.\n\nSmallpox is considered one of the most deadly viral diseases in human history, with a mortality rate that can reach up to 30% in unvaccinated individuals. The virus primarily spreads through direct contact with infectious materials or respiratory droplets, and it can cause severe systemic illness characterized by fever, fatigue, and a distinctive rash that progresses into fluid-filled lesions and scabs.\n\nDue to the successful global eradication of smallpox through widespread vaccination, the Variola virus is now considered a highly dangerous pathogen, and its use as a potential biological weapon is a significant concern for public health authorities worldwide.",
