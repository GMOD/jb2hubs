  "description": "Simian T-lymphotropic virus 2 (STLV-2) is a type of retrovirus that primarily infects non-human primates, such as certain species of monkeys and apes. It is closely related to the human T-lymphotropic virus type 2 (HTLV-2), which is also a member of the STLV family.\n\nSTLV-2 is a complex retrovirus that targets and infects T-lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell crucial for the immune system. The virus incorporates its genetic material into the host cell's DNA, enabling it to replicate and spread within the host. Infection with STLV-2 can lead to the development of various hematological and neurological disorders in the infected non-human primate species.\n\nThe transmission of STLV-2 is believed to occur through close contact, such as biting or scratching, between infected and uninfected individuals. The virus has been detected in various primate populations, including certain species of Old World monkeys and great apes, but its prevalence and impact on these species can vary.\n\nStudying STLV-2 and its relationship with HTLV-2 provides valuable insights into the evolution and cross-species transmission of retroviruses, which is an important area of research in the field of comparative virology and zoonotic disease prevention.",
