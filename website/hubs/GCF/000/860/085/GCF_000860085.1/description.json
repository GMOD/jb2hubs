  "description": "Vaccinia virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus within the Poxviridae family. It is a large, complex, double-stranded DNA virus that can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. Vaccinia virus is notable for its use as a vaccine against smallpox, a related and deadly disease caused by the variola virus.\n\nThe vaccinia virus particle is brick-shaped and measures approximately 300 to 400 nanometers in length. It contains a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of around 190,000 base pairs, encoding over 200 genes involved in viral replication, host immune evasion, and other functions.\n\nVaccinia virus enters host cells through the interaction of viral surface proteins with cellular receptors, leading to membrane fusion and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. The virus then uses the host's cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles, which are released from the cell by lysis or budding.\n\nVaccinia virus has been extensively studied due to its historical use as a smallpox vaccine and its potential as a platform for the development of new vaccines and oncolytic therapies. Understanding the biology and molecular mechanisms of vaccinia virus has contributed to our knowledge of poxvirus evolution and the development of improved strategies for disease prevention and treatment.",
