  "description": "Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. It is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and can infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including rodents, birds, and humans.\n\nThe SFV genome is approximately 11.5 kilobases in length and encodes four non-structural proteins and five structural proteins. The virus enters host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and uses the host's cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles.\n\nSemliki Forest virus is primarily found in sub-Saharan Africa, where it was first isolated in the Semliki Forest of Uganda in 1944. Infection with SFV can cause a variety of symptoms in humans, ranging from mild febrile illness to more severe neurological complications, such as encephalitis. The virus is considered an emerging pathogen, and research on its biology, epidemiology, and potential for causing disease outbreaks is ongoing.",
