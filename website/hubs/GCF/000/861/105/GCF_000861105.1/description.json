  "description": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Hepeviridae family. It is a significant cause of acute viral hepatitis, particularly in developing countries with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water.\n\nThe HEV genome is approximately 7.2 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a non-structural polyprotein responsible for viral replication, ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein, and ORF3 encodes a small multifunctional protein involved in viral assembly and release.\n\nHEV is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often through the consumption of contaminated water or undercooked meat from infected animals, such as pigs, deer, and wild boar. Genotypes 1 and 2 of HEV are mainly found in developing countries, while genotypes 3 and 4 are more prevalent in industrialized nations.\n\nHepatitis E is typically a self-limiting disease, with most infections resolving within a few weeks. However, in some cases, particularly in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals, HEV infection can lead to severe complications, including fulminant hepatic failure and chronic hepatitis.\n\nEffective prevention measures include improving sanitation, access to clean water, and promoting proper hygiene practices. Vaccination is also available in some countries, providing protection against HEV infection.",
