  "description": "Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease that primarily affects wild and domestic rabbits. It belongs to the genus Lagovirus, which is part of the Caliciviridae family.\n\nRHDV is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. The virus primarily targets the liver and other internal organs, causing severe hemorrhages and rapid death in infected rabbits. The disease is characterized by high fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, and internal bleeding leading to organ failure.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected rabbits or their secretions, as well as through contaminated food, water, or environment. RHDV can also be spread by insects, such as flies, and can persist in the environment for extended periods.\n\nRHDV is considered a significant threat to rabbit populations, both domestic and wild, and has led to the decline of many rabbit populations in various parts of the world. Effective prevention and control measures, including vaccination and strict biosecurity protocols, are essential to mitigate the impact of this devastating viral disease.",
