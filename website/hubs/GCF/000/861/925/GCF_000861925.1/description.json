  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 7 (HPV-7) is a species of the Papillomavirus genus, which belongs to the Papillomaviridae family. HPV-7 is classified as a mucosotropic virus, meaning it primarily infects the mucosal surfaces of the human body.\n\nHPV-7 is associated with the development of various types of warts, including common warts, plantar warts, and flat warts. The virus primarily targets the skin and mucous membranes, and it can be transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.\n\nThe genome of HPV-7 is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule, approximately 8,000 base pairs in length. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the formation of the viral capsid structure.\n\nHPV-7 is considered a low-risk type of human papillomavirus, meaning it is less likely to progress to more severe conditions, such as cervical cancer, compared to high-risk HPV types. However, it can still cause persistent infections and may lead to the development of benign lesions or warts.\n\nDiagnosis of HPV-7 infection typically involves visual examination of the affected skin or mucous membranes, followed by confirmatory laboratory testing, such as DNA detection or serological analysis. Treatment options may include topical therapies, cryotherapy, or surgical removal of the lesions, depending on the severity and location of the infection.",
