  "description": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with an estimated 68,000 cases and 15,000 deaths annually.\n\nJEV is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes, particularly Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which breed in flooded rice fields and other agricultural areas. The virus can also be transmitted through the consumption of undercooked pork or infected pork products.\n\nThe virus targets the central nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). Symptoms range from mild febrile illness to severe neurological complications, including seizures, paralysis, and coma. While most infections are asymptomatic, the case-fatality rate can reach up to 30% in severe cases.\n\nEffective vaccines have been developed to prevent Japanese encephalitis, and public health measures, such as mosquito control and improved agricultural practices, have helped reduce the burden of the disease in some regions. However, JEV remains a significant public health concern in parts of Asia, highlighting the need for continued research and surveillance efforts.",
