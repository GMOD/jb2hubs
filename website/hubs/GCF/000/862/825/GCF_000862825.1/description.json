  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 49 (HPV49) is a species of virus belonging to the Papillomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that infects the epithelial cells of the skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV49 is classified as a member of the genus Betapapillomavirus, which includes several types of HPV that are commonly found on the skin and are not typically associated with the development of cancerous lesions. The virus is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.\n\nInfection with HPV49 can lead to the development of benign skin lesions, such as warts or papillomas, but it is not considered a high-risk type for the development of cervical cancer or other types of cancer. The virus is relatively common in the general population and is often found on the skin of healthy individuals without causing any clinical symptoms.\n\nOverall, HPV49 is a relatively well-studied member of the Papillomaviridae family, and its genomic and biological characteristics continue to be the subject of ongoing research in the field of virology and dermatology.",
