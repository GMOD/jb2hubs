  "description": "Onyong-nyong virus (ONNV) is an arbovirus that belongs to the Alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. It is primarily transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes and is closely related to the Chikungunya virus.\n\nONNV was first isolated in 1959 during an outbreak in Uganda and has since been reported in various regions of Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. The virus is known to cause a disease characterized by fever, joint pain, and rash, which is similar to the symptoms associated with Chikungunya virus infection.\n\nThe ONNV genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes structural and non-structural proteins. The virus can replicate in both mosquito vectors and human hosts, with the infection cycle involving the virus entering and replicating within host cells.\n\nOnyong-nyong virus is considered an emerging pathogen, and its potential for causing outbreaks and spreading to new geographical areas is an ongoing concern for public health authorities, particularly in areas where the Anopheles mosquito species are prevalent.",
