  "description": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, particularly from the Ixodes genus.\n\nTBEV is the causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis, a serious neurological disease that can lead to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). The virus is primarily found in parts of Europe and Asia, where it is endemic in certain regions.\n\nThe virus enters the human body through the tick bite and travels through the bloodstream to the central nervous system, where it can replicate and cause the characteristic neurological symptoms. These can include fever, headache, nausea, and in severe cases, altered mental status, seizures, and even death.\n\nDiagnosis of TBEV infection typically involves serological tests to detect the presence of specific antibodies in the patient's blood. Treatment is mainly supportive, as there are no specific antiviral drugs approved for TBEV infection. However, vaccination is available in some regions to prevent the disease in at-risk populations.\n\nOngoing research continues to focus on understanding the virus's biology, improving diagnostic tools, and developing more effective treatments and preventive measures to combat this important public health concern.",
