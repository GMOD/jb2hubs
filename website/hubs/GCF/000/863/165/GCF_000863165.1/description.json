  "description": "Louping ill virus (LIV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus, which is part of the family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks, also known as the sheep tick or castor bean tick.\n\nLIV is the causative agent of louping ill, a serious neurological disease that primarily affects sheep, but can also infect other domestic and wild ruminants, as well as humans. The virus is primarily found in upland areas of the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, where the Ixodes ricinus tick is prevalent.\n\nInfection with LIV can lead to a range of clinical symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and neurological complications such as encephalitis (brain inflammation) and meningitis. In severe cases, the disease can be fatal, particularly in sheep.\n\nThe virus is maintained in nature through a cycle involving the tick vector and various vertebrate hosts, including sheep, deer, and other small mammals. Humans can become infected through the bite of an infected tick or through direct contact with infected animals or their tissues.\n\nPrevention and control of louping ill involve measures to reduce tick populations, such as habitat management and the use of acaricides (tick-killing chemicals), as well as vaccination of livestock and awareness campaigns to educate the public about the disease and its transmission.",
