  "description": "Human orthorubulavirus 2 is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthorubulavirus, which is part of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus.\n\nThe human orthorubulavirus 2 virion is spherical or pleomorphic in shape, with a diameter of approximately 150-300 nanometers. The viral genome is approximately 15-19 kilobases in length and encodes several structural and non-structural proteins, including the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), and attachment protein (H or G).\n\nThis virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and can cause a range of respiratory illnesses in humans, from mild upper respiratory tract infections to more severe pneumonia. The virus has the ability to infect and replicate within the cells of the human respiratory tract, leading to the development of clinical symptoms.\n\nDiagnostic methods for human orthorubulavirus 2 infection typically involve molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), to detect the presence of viral genetic material in clinical samples. Effective treatments and preventive measures, such as vaccines, are ongoing areas of research and development.",
