  "description": "Rotavirus C is a member of the Rotavirus genus within the Reoviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the gastrointestinal tract of various mammals, including humans.\n\nRotavirus C particles are icosahedral in shape and measure approximately 70-80 nanometers in diameter. The viral genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which encode for six structural proteins and five non-structural proteins.\n\nRotavirus C is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and it can cause acute gastroenteritis, characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The virus is capable of infecting individuals of all ages, but it is more commonly associated with disease in older children and adults, unlike the more prevalent Rotavirus A, which primarily affects young children.\n\nRotavirus C has a global distribution, but its prevalence and epidemiological significance vary by geographic region. It is considered a less common cause of diarrheal disease compared to Rotavirus A, but it can still contribute to the overall burden of rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis in certain populations.",
