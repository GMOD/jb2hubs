  "description": "Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a lentivirus, a subgroup of the retrovirus family, that primarily infects and destroys the CD4+ T cells of the human immune system. HIV-1 is the most common and pathogenic strain of the HIV virus, responsible for the majority of HIV infections worldwide.\n\nThe virus has a spherical structure and a diameter of approximately 120 nanometers. Its genome consists of two single-stranded RNA molecules that encode nine major genes, essential for its replication and survival within the host cell. The virus uses its envelope glycoproteins, gp120 and gp41, to bind to the CD4 receptor and co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) on the surface of the target CD4+ T cells, facilitating its entry and subsequent integration into the host cell's genome.\n\nOnce inside the host cell, HIV-1 hijacks the cell's machinery to produce new viral particles, which are then released to infect other CD4+ T cells. The progressive depletion of these essential immune cells leads to the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the most advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by the increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain cancers.\n\nWithout antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 infection typically progresses to AIDS within 8 to 10 years, ultimately leading to the patient's death. However, with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prognosis for individuals living with HIV-1 has significantly improved, allowing them to maintain a healthy immune system and lead relatively normal lives.",
