  "description": "Dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is one of the four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus that can cause dengue fever, a mosquito-borne infectious disease.\n\nDENV-4 is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are the primary vectors for dengue virus transmission. The virus enters the human host and primarily infects and replicates within the host's immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.\n\nUpon infection, the virus can cause a range of clinical manifestations, from mild flu-like symptoms to more severe forms of the disease, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The symptoms of DENV-4 infection are similar to those of other dengue virus serotypes and include fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, rash, and in some cases, bleeding and plasma leakage.\n\nDENV-4 is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. The epidemiology and distribution of this serotype can vary over time and geographic location, as it is influenced by factors such as climate, human population density, and the presence of competent mosquito vectors.\n\nEffective prevention and control of DENV-4 infection rely on integrated strategies, including mosquito vector control, early diagnosis, and supportive clinical management of patients. Ongoing research efforts are focused on developing safe and effective vaccines and antiviral therapies to combat the global burden of dengue virus infections.",
