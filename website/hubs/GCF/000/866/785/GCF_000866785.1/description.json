  "description": "Saint Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus, which is part of the family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly those belonging to the Culex genus.\n\nSLEV is considered an arbovirus, meaning it is transmitted by arthropod vectors, in this case, mosquitoes. The virus can cause a serious and potentially fatal neuroinvasive disease known as Saint Louis encephalitis, which primarily affects the central nervous system and can lead to symptoms such as fever, headache, confusion, and in severe cases, coma and death.\n\nThe virus is primarily found in North America, with the most significant outbreaks occurring in the central and eastern United States. Infection with SLEV can range from asymptomatic to severe, with the risk of severe disease being higher in older individuals and those with compromised immune systems.\n\nPrevention and control of SLEV primarily focus on mosquito control measures, such as eliminating breeding habitats and using insecticides, as well as personal protective measures, such as the use of insect repellents and protective clothing. Vaccination is not currently available for SLEV, and treatment is primarily supportive, targeting the management of symptoms and complications.",
