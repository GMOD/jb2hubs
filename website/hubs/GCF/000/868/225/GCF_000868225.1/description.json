  "description": "Human papillomavirus 103 (HPV103) is a type of human papillomavirus that belongs to the Alphapapillomavirus genus. It is a double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects the skin and mucous membranes of the human body.\n\nHPV103 is considered a low-risk type of HPV, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of precancerous lesions or cancer compared to high-risk HPV types. The virus typically causes benign skin warts or papillomas, which are small, elevated growths on the skin or mucous membranes.\n\nThe genomic structure of HPV103 consists of approximately 8,000 base pairs and encodes several genes responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the production of viral proteins. These proteins play a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect and replicate within host cells.\n\nLike other HPV types, HPV103 is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. The virus can persist in the body for an extended period, and in some cases, it may remain latent without causing any visible symptoms.\n\nWhile HPV103 is generally considered a low-risk type, it is essential to monitor and manage any skin or mucosal lesions that may develop, as they can potentially lead to more serious health complications in some individuals.",
