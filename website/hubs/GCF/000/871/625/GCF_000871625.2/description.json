  "description": "The European Bat 2 Lyssavirus (EBLV-2) is a species of rabies-like virus that primarily infects certain bat species found in Europe. It belongs to the genus Lyssavirus, a group of viruses known to cause the fatal neurological disease called rabies in various mammalian hosts.\n\nEBLV-2 is primarily associated with the Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii), a common bat species found across Europe. The virus is typically transmitted through direct contact with infected bats, such as through bites or scratches.\n\nGenetically, EBLV-2 is closely related to, but distinct from, the classical rabies virus (RABV) that is more commonly found in terrestrial mammals. While EBLV-2 can infect humans, it is considered a rare cause of human rabies, with only a few reported cases worldwide.\n\nThe virus primarily affects the central nervous system of infected bats and can lead to neurological symptoms, altered behavior, and eventually death in the affected animals. Ongoing surveillance and research are essential to understand the epidemiology, host ecology, and potential public health implications of this lyssavirus species.",
