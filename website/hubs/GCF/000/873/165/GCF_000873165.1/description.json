  "description": "Orthorubulavirus mapueraense is a species of virus belonging to the genus Orthorubulavirus, which is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae. This virus was first identified in Mapuera, Brazil, and is primarily found in bats of the genus Artibeus.\n\nThe Orthorubulavirus mapueraense virus has a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, and its virions are enveloped with a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell membrane. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), and attachment (G) proteins, which are involved in viral replication, assembly, and host cell entry.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Orthorubulavirus mapueraense is closely related to other Orthorubulavirus species found in bats, suggesting a potential for zoonotic transmission. However, the exact host range, transmission dynamics, and potential for causing disease in humans or other animals are still under investigation.",
