  "description": "Human papillomavirus 88 (HPV88) is a species of the Papillomavirus genus within the Papillomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects the skin and mucous membranes of humans.\n\nHPV88 is classified as a beta-papillomavirus, which are a group of HPV types that are typically associated with benign skin lesions, such as warts, rather than cervical cancer. The viral genome of HPV88 encodes several early (E) and late (L) genes that are responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the production of viral structural proteins.\n\nInfection with HPV88 is relatively uncommon and is often asymptomatic. In some cases, it may lead to the development of cutaneous warts or other benign skin lesions. The transmission of HPV88 typically occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.\n\nWhile the clinical significance of HPV88 infection is not as well-studied as some other HPV types, continued research and surveillance of this and other HPV species can contribute to a better understanding of the diversity and potential impact of papillomaviruses on human health.",
