  "description": "Saffold virus 2 (SAFV-2) is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Salivirus within the family Picornaviridae. It was first discovered in 2007 and is considered a member of the Saffold virus species, which are a group of genetically diverse human viruses.\n\nThe genome of SAFV-2 is approximately 8.1 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is post-translationally cleaved into structural and non-structural viral proteins. The virus primarily infects the gastrointestinal tract and has been associated with a range of clinical manifestations, including gastroenteritis, respiratory symptoms, and neurological disorders, though its exact pathogenic role is still under investigation.\n\nSAFV-2 is believed to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and seroepidemiological studies have shown that exposure to the virus is relatively common in human populations, particularly in children. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, clinical significance, and potential public health implications of this emerging human virus.",
