  "description": "Thottapalayam virus (TPMV) is a species of hantavirus that was first isolated from a house shrew (Suncus murinus) captured in Thottapalayam village, India, in 1964. Hantaviruses are a group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that are primarily hosted by rodents and insectivores, and can cause serious diseases in humans.\n\nTPMV is unique among hantaviruses as it is the only known hantavirus to be primarily associated with a shrew (insectivore) host, rather than a rodent host. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that TPMV is distinct from other hantaviruses and represents an ancient lineage that diverged from the main hantavirus clade.\n\nThe genome of TPMV consists of three segments of single-stranded RNA that encode the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein precursor (GPC), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) protein. TPMV has been detected in various shrew species across Asia, including the house shrew, the Asian house shrew, and the Taiwanese white-toothed shrew.\n\nWhile TPMV has not been associated with any known human disease, its unique evolutionary history and host association make it an interesting subject for further research on hantavirus diversity, evolution, and host-virus interactions.",
