  "description": "Astrovirus MLB1 is a species of virus that belongs to the family Astroviridae. It is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The virus was first discovered in 2008 in stool samples from a patient with acute gastroenteritis in the United States.\n\nAstrovirus MLB1 is classified within the genus Mamastrovirus, which includes astroviruses found in various mammalian species. The virus has a genome of approximately 6.8 kilobases in length and encodes three major open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of the viral structural and non-structural proteins.\n\nAstrovirus MLB1 has been detected in human stool samples from various regions worldwide, and it has been associated with cases of acute gastroenteritis, particularly in children. However, its exact role in causing human disease and its epidemiological characteristics are still under investigation. Further research is needed to better understand the prevalence, transmission, and potential clinical significance of this virus.",
