  "description": "Rotavirus A is a species of rotavirus, a group of double-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the Reoviridae family. Rotavirus A is the most common and clinically significant species of rotavirus, responsible for causing acute gastroenteritis in children and infants worldwide.\n\nThe virus particle is approximately 70 nanometers in diameter and has a distinctive wheel-like (rotary) appearance, which gives the virus its name. The viral genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which encode six structural proteins and six nonstructural proteins.\n\nRotavirus A primarily infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine, causing severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. The virus is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and it is a leading cause of childhood diarrheal disease, particularly in developing countries. Rotavirus A infections are a major public health concern, as they can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in young children if left untreated.\n\nThe development of effective rotavirus vaccines has been an important step in reducing the global burden of rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis. Ongoing research and surveillance efforts continue to improve our understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention strategies for Rotavirus A infections.",
