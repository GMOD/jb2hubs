  "description": "Simian T-cell lymphotropic virus 6 (STLV-6) is a type of retrovirus that primarily infects non-human primates, such as certain species of monkeys and apes. It belongs to the genus Deltaretrovirus, which is part of the broader family Retroviridae.\n\nSTLV-6 is closely related to the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) group, which are known to cause various types of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma in humans. However, the specific pathogenic effects of STLV-6 in its natural non-human primate hosts are not yet fully understood.\n\nThe virus is believed to be transmitted primarily through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or saliva, from infected individuals. STLV-6 has been detected in several primate species, including various species of Old World monkeys and great apes, but its prevalence and distribution in wild primate populations is still being investigated.\n\nResearch on STLV-6 is ongoing, as it may provide insights into the evolution and potential zoonotic (cross-species) transmission of related retroviruses, as well as the complex interactions between these viruses and their non-human primate hosts.",
