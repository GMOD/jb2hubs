  "description": "Rabbit Calicivirus Australia 1 MIC-07 is a strain of the Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV), which is a member of the Lagovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. This virus is known to cause a highly contagious and often fatal disease in wild and domestic rabbits.\n\nThe virus is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with an icosahedral capsid structure. The genome of the Rabbit Calicivirus Australia 1 MIC-07 strain is approximately 7.4 kilobases in length and encodes for several structural and non-structural proteins that are essential for the virus's replication and pathogenesis.\n\nThis particular strain of the virus was first identified in Australia in 2007 and has been associated with outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in various regions of the country. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected rabbits or their secretions, as well as through indirect routes such as contaminated food, water, or fomites.\n\nThe infection with the Rabbit Calicivirus Australia 1 MIC-07 strain typically results in a rapid onset of clinical signs, including fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, and internal bleeding, which can lead to the death of the infected rabbits within 12-36 hours. The virus has a high mortality rate, making it a significant concern for rabbit populations and the agricultural industry.",
