  "description": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which also includes other medically important viruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. ZIKV is primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito species, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nThe Zika virus genome encodes for a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope) and seven non-structural proteins. These proteins play crucial roles in the virus's life cycle, including host cell entry, genome replication, and assembly of new viral particles.\n\nThe primary mode of ZIKV transmission is through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, the virus can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, through sexual contact, and potentially through blood transfusions and organ transplantation.\n\nInfection with ZIKV can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. In some cases, particularly during outbreaks, ZIKV infection has been associated with more severe neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly in newborns.\n\nThe global spread of ZIKV and its potential for causing severe disease has prompted extensive research into the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapies. Ongoing efforts aim to better understand the virus's biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis to improve diagnostic tools and mitigation strategies.",
