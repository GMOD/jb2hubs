  "description": "Calicivirus pig/AB90/CAN is a strain of the Calicivirus genus that primarily infects pigs. Caliciviruses are a family of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nThe Calicivirus pig/AB90/CAN strain was isolated from pigs in Canada in 1990. It is a member of the Sapovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family, which includes viruses that can cause gastroenteritis in various animal species, including pigs.\n\nCaliciviruses, including the Calicivirus pig/AB90/CAN strain, have a characteristic morphology with a cuboidal or icosahedral shape and a diameter of approximately 27-40 nanometers. The viral genome is composed of a single, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA molecule of around 7.5-8.5 kilobases in length.\n\nThe Calicivirus pig/AB90/CAN strain is believed to be capable of causing acute gastroenteritis in pigs, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. However, the specific pathogenicity and epidemiological characteristics of this particular strain may require further research and investigation.",
