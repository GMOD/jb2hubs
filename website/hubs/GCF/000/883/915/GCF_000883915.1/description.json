  "description": "Wesselsbron virus (WSLV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. It is primarily found in Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan regions.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, with Aedes aegypti and Aedes africanus being the primary vectors. The virus can also be transmitted from infected animals, such as livestock, to humans through direct contact or exposure to their bodily fluids.\n\nWSLV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 11 kilobases. The virus is enveloped and has a spherical shape with a diameter of around 50 nanometers.\n\nInfection with WSLV can cause a febrile illness in humans, often accompanied by symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and rash. In some cases, more severe complications, such as encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever, can occur, particularly in pregnant women or immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe virus is primarily maintained in nature through a transmission cycle involving mosquitoes and various animal hosts, including livestock, wild ruminants, and rodents. Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of WSLV is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies in affected regions.",
