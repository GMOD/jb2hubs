  "description": "HMO Astrovirus A is a virus species that belongs to the Astroviridae family. Astroviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The HMO Astrovirus A is a novel astrovirus that was first identified in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) obtained from human breast milk samples.\n\nThe viral genome of HMO Astrovirus A is approximately 6.8 to 7.3 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that are characteristic of astroviruses. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the non-structural proteins involved in viral replication, while ORF2 encodes the capsid protein.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that HMO Astrovirus A is genetically distinct from previously known human and animal astrovirus species, suggesting that it represents a novel astrovirus lineage. Its discovery in human breast milk samples indicates a potential role in human health and development, though its exact pathogenic potential and transmission dynamics are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the prevalence, host range, and potential clinical significance of this newly identified astrovirus species.",
