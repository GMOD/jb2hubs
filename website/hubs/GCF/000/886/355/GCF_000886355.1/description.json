  "description": "Torque teno virus 4 (TTV4) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Anelloviridae family. It is one of the numerous Torque teno virus (TTV) species that have been identified in various animal hosts, including humans.\n\nTTV4 is a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 3.8 to 3.9 kilobases. The viral genome encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are involved in the replication and expression of the viral proteins.\n\nTTV4, like other Torque teno viruses, is commonly found in the human population, with a high prevalence observed worldwide. The virus is thought to be transmitted through various routes, including fecal-oral and respiratory routes, and it can establish persistent infections in the host.\n\nThe exact role and pathogenic potential of TTV4 in human health and disease are not fully understood. Some studies have suggested that TTV4 infection may be associated with certain clinical conditions, such as liver diseases and respiratory tract infections, but the causal relationship is still a subject of ongoing research.\n\nOverall, Torque teno virus 4 is a member of the diverse Anelloviridae family, and its epidemiology, transmission, and potential clinical implications continue to be the focus of ongoing scientific investigations.",
