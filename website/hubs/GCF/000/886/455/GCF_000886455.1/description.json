  "description": "Cosavirus E is a member of the genus Cosavirus, which belongs to the family Picornaviridae. Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nCosavirus E is a recently discovered virus that was first identified in human stool samples. It is classified within the Cosavirus genus, which includes several genetically distinct virus strains found in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other mammals.\n\nThe genome of Cosavirus E is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the various structural and non-structural viral proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Cosavirus E is genetically distinct from other known Cosavirus strains, indicating it represents a unique viral species within the genus.\n\nThe natural reservoir and transmission dynamics of Cosavirus E are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the prevalence, clinical significance, and potential public health implications of this newly described picornavirus.",
