  "description": "Cosavirus D is a species of virus belonging to the genus Cosavirus, which is part of the family Picornaviridae. Picornaviruses are small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.\n\nCosavirus D was first identified in human stool samples and is considered to be a member of the human gut virome. The genome of Cosavirus D is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes for a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural and non-structural viral proteins.\n\nLimited information is available about the epidemiology, clinical significance, and biological properties of Cosavirus D, as it is a recently discovered virus. Further research is needed to understand its potential role in human health and disease.",
