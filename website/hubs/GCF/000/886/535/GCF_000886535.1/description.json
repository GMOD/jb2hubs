  "description": "Salivirus NG-J1 is a recently discovered virus that belongs to the family Picornaviridae. It was first isolated from a human saliva sample collected in Nigeria.\n\nThe Salivirus NG-J1 is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Salivirus NG-J1 is closely related to other saliviruses, a genus within the Picornaviridae family. However, it represents a distinct species within this genus, showing significant genetic divergence from previously described saliviruses.\n\nThe natural host and transmission dynamics of Salivirus NG-J1 are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate its prevalence, geographic distribution, potential association with human disease, and role in the human virome.",
