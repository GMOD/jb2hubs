  "description": "Torque teno virus 10 (TTV-10) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus was first identified in the early 2000s and is a member of the Torque teno virus (TTV) genus, which includes a diverse group of related viruses found in various vertebrate hosts.\n\nTTV-10 is approximately 30-32 nanometers in diameter and has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome that is around 3.8-3.9 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes several proteins, including the viral capsid protein, which is responsible for the structural integrity of the virus particle.\n\nTTV-10 is primarily found in the human population, with a worldwide distribution. Infection with TTV-10 is generally asymptomatic, and the virus is often detected in the blood and various other tissues of healthy individuals. The exact modes of transmission and the potential clinical significance of TTV-10 infection are still under investigation, as the virus is not typically associated with any specific disease.\n\nResearchers continue to study the epidemiology, genomic diversity, and potential biological roles of TTV-10 and other Torque teno viruses to better understand their prevalence, host-virus interactions, and potential clinical implications.",
