  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 3 (TTMV3) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Anelloviridae. It is a member of the Torque teno mini virus genus, which includes several other genetically distinct species of torque teno mini viruses.\n\nTTMV3 has a circular DNA genome of approximately 2.9 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes at least two major open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of viral proteins, including the viral capsid protein.\n\nTorque teno mini viruses, including TTMV3, are known to be ubiquitous in human populations, with high prevalence rates detected in various human samples, such as blood, saliva, and other body fluids. However, the precise role and pathogenic potential of TTMV3 in human health and disease remain under investigation.\n\nDue to the small size and genetic diversity of the Torque teno mini viruses, their classification and taxonomy are still a subject of ongoing research and discussion within the scientific community.",
