  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 1 (TTMVIa) is a small, non-enveloped virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. It is a member of the Alphatorquevirus genus, which includes several species of Torque teno mini viruses (TTMVs).\n\nTTMVIa has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome, approximately 2.8-3.2 kilobases in size. The viral genome encodes for at least three open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to produce several viral proteins, including the viral capsid protein.\n\nTTMVIa is widely distributed in the human population, with high prevalence rates reported globally. It is typically found in the blood and other human tissues, although its exact mode of transmission and potential clinical significance are still under investigation.\n\nLike other members of the Anelloviridae family, TTMVIa is considered a persistent, latent virus that can establish chronic infections in the host. The virus has been detected in both healthy individuals and those with various medical conditions, suggesting that it may not be the primary cause of any specific disease.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the biology, epidemiology, and potential clinical implications of Torque teno mini virus 1 and other Anelloviruses in human health and disease.",
