  "description": "Human papillomavirus 132 (HPV132) is a species of human papillomavirus that belongs to the genus Alphapapillomavirus. It is a small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that primarily infects the mucosal and cutaneous epithelia of the human body.\n\nHPV132 is classified as a high-risk HPV type, meaning it has the potential to cause the development of precancerous lesions and invasive cancer, particularly in the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and anus. The virus can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual activity.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV132 encodes several key proteins, including the early proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and the late proteins (L1 and L2). These proteins play essential roles in viral DNA replication, gene expression, and the assembly of new viral particles.\n\nLike other high-risk HPV types, HPV132 can lead to the development of precancerous lesions, known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can progress to invasive cervical cancer if left untreated. Regular screening and appropriate medical intervention are crucial for the early detection and management of HPV132-related infections and associated lesions.",
