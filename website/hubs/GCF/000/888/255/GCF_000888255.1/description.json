  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 7 (TTMmV-7) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus was first identified in human samples and is considered a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family.\n\nTTMmV-7 has a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA genome that is approximately 2.8 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes for several open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to be involved in the replication and expression of the viral proteins.\n\nThe Anelloviridae family, to which TTMmV-7 belongs, is a diverse group of small DNA viruses that are known to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans, primates, and other mammals. These viruses are considered ubiquitous in human populations, with high prevalence rates reported worldwide.\n\nWhile the exact role and clinical significance of TTMmV-7 in human health and disease are not fully understood, ongoing research suggests that the Anelloviridae family, including TTMmV-7, may be associated with various health conditions and may have a role in modulating the human immune system.",
