  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 2 (TTMVs-2) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus is classified as a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family.\n\nTTMVs-2 has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome that is approximately 2.8 to 3.2 kilobases in size. The viral genome encodes several proteins, including the viral capsid protein, which is responsible for the formation of the viral particle.\n\nTTMVs-2 is widely distributed in the human population and has been detected in various human samples, including blood, feces, and respiratory secretions. The virus is believed to be transmitted through multiple routes, including fecal-oral and respiratory routes.\n\nThe prevalence and clinical significance of TTMVs-2 infection in humans are not yet fully understood. While some studies have suggested a potential association between TTMVs-2 infection and certain health conditions, more research is needed to elucidate the exact role of this virus in human health and disease.",
