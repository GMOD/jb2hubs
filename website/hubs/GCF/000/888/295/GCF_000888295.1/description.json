  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 4 (TTMnV4) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Anelloviridae. This virus is considered a member of the genus Betatorquevirus, which includes various Torque teno mini virus (TTMnV) species.\n\nThe TTMnV4 genome is circular and typically ranges from approximately 2.6 to 2.8 kilobase pairs in length. The viral genome encodes a limited number of proteins, primarily involved in viral replication and transcription.\n\nTorque teno mini viruses, including TTMnV4, are known to infect a wide range of mammalian hosts, including humans. However, the precise pathogenic role of these viruses in their hosts is not yet fully understood. Many individuals infected with TTMnV4 and other Torque teno viruses exhibit no apparent clinical symptoms, suggesting a potential commensal or opportunistic relationship between the virus and its host.\n\nResearch on the Torque teno mini viruses, including TTMnV4, is ongoing, as scientists continue to investigate their prevalence, diversity, and potential implications in human and animal health.",
