  "description": "The Tai Forest ebolavirus is a species of filovirus that belongs to the Ebolavirus genus. It is named after the Taï National Park in Côte d'Ivoire, where it was first discovered in 1994.\n\nThe Tai Forest ebolavirus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. It has a typical filovirus morphology, appearing as long, filamentous particles. The viral genome is approximately 19 kilobases in length and encodes seven structural proteins, including the glycoprotein (GP), which is responsible for host cell attachment and entry.\n\nThe natural reservoir host of the Tai Forest ebolavirus is not yet fully established, but it is believed to be associated with certain species of fruit bats found in the Taï National Park region. Transmission to humans typically occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids.\n\nThe Tai Forest ebolavirus can cause a severe and often fatal disease in humans, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Symptoms typically include fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising. The case fatality rate for Tai Forest ebolavirus infections can range from 50% to 90%, depending on various factors.\n\nEffective treatment and prevention measures for Tai Forest ebolavirus infections are still being developed, and ongoing research aims to further understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential interventions for this deadly virus.",
