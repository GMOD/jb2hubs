  "description": "Human polyomavirus 6 (HPyV6) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Polyomaviridae family. It was first discovered in 2010 from skin swab samples of healthy individuals.\n\nThe viral genome of HPyV6 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA approximately 5 kilobases in length. The genome encodes for early regulatory proteins, such as the large T antigen and small T antigen, as well as the late structural proteins, including the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.\n\nHPyV6 is commonly found on human skin and is thought to establish a lifelong, asymptomatic infection in most individuals. The virus is believed to be transmitted through close personal contact or environmental exposure. While the exact role of HPyV6 in human health and disease is still under investigation, it has been associated with various skin conditions, including actinic keratosis and Merkel cell carcinoma, although its direct involvement in these diseases is not yet fully understood.\n\nOngoing research aims to further elucidate the prevalence, transmission, and potential clinical implications of HPyV6 infection, contributing to our understanding of this member of the human polyomavirus family.",
