  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 5 (TTMnV-5) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the family Anelloviridae. It is classified as a member of the genus Betatorquevirus.\n\nTTMnV-5 has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome, approximately 2.8 kilobases in size. The viral genome encodes for two major open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of viral proteins.\n\nTTMnV-5 is known to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. The virus is believed to be ubiquitous in human populations, with high prevalence rates reported worldwide. However, the clinical significance of TTMnV-5 infection in humans is not yet fully understood.\n\nResearchers are still investigating the potential role of TTMnV-5 in human health and disease. Some studies have suggested that it may be associated with certain conditions, but its precise relationship with human health remains an area of ongoing research and investigation.",
