  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 131 (HPV131) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species. HPV131 is a high-risk type of human papillomavirus, which means it is associated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly cervical cancer.\n\nThe HPV131 genome consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which can disrupt the normal cell cycle and promote cellular transformation, leading to the development of cancerous lesions.\n\nHPV131 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and can infect the mucosal epithelial cells of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, and anus. Infection with HPV131 can cause the development of precancerous lesions, known as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which can progress to invasive cervical cancer if left untreated.\n\nThe prevalence and distribution of HPV131 varies across different geographical regions and populations. Continued research and surveillance are crucial for understanding the epidemiology, clinical significance, and potential interventions for managing HPV131 infections and associated diseases.",
