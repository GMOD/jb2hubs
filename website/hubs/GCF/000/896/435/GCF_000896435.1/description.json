  "description": "Human papillomavirus 126 (HPV-126) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various host species, including humans. HPV-126 is classified as a member of the Alpha-papillomavirus genus, which includes several types of HPV that are known to infect the human genital tract.\n\nHPV-126 is a double-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several early (E) and late (L) genes, which are responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the production of structural proteins that make up the viral capsid.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission for HPV-126 is through direct skin-to-skin contact or through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Once the virus enters the host's epithelial cells, it can establish a persistent infection, leading to the development of various types of warts or lesions, depending on the specific HPV type and the host's immune response.\n\nHPV-126 is not as well-studied as some of the more common HPV types, and its clinical significance and potential association with specific diseases or conditions are still under investigation. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential implications of HPV-126 infection in human populations.",
