  "description": "Gyrovirus GyV3 is a member of the Gyrovirus genus within the Anelloviridae family. Gyroviruses are small, non-enveloped, single-stranded circular DNA viruses that primarily infect avian species.\n\nThe Gyrovirus GyV3 genome is approximately 2.3 kilobases in length and encodes three major open reading frames (ORFs) that give rise to viral proteins involved in genome replication, structural components, and potential regulatory functions.\n\nGyrovirus GyV3 has been detected in various domestic and wild bird species, including chickens, turkeys, and wild waterfowl. The virus is believed to be widespread in avian populations, but its exact prevalence and impact on host health are still under investigation.\n\nGyroviruses, including GyV3, are generally considered to have a low pathogenic potential in their natural avian hosts. However, their zoonotic potential and possible associations with certain human diseases are still being explored by the scientific community.",
