  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 137 (HPV-137) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HPV-137 is classified as a member of the genus Alphapapillomavirus, which primarily infects human epithelial cells, including those found in the skin and mucous membranes.\n\nHPV-137 is considered a low-risk HPV type, meaning it is less likely to cause the development of cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types. However, infection with HPV-137 can still lead to the formation of benign warts or papillomas, which are small, non-cancerous growths on the skin or mucous membranes.\n\nThe genome of HPV-137 contains approximately 8,000 base pairs and encodes for several essential viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 proteins, which play a role in the viral life cycle and the potential for cellular transformation. The transmission of HPV-137 primarily occurs through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces.\n\nWhile HPV-137 infections are generally less concerning from a clinical perspective compared to high-risk HPV types, ongoing research and surveillance are important to continue understanding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of this and other HPV types.",
