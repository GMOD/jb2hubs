  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 144 (HPV-144) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HPV-144 is considered a rare and understudied type within the HPV genus, with limited available information in the scientific literature.\n\nHPV-144 is primarily associated with cutaneous warts or papillomas, which are benign epithelial growths that can appear on the skin. The virus infects the basal layer of the epidermis, where it can establish a persistent infection and induce the proliferation of infected cells, leading to the formation of the characteristic wart-like lesions.\n\nUnlike some high-risk HPV types that are linked to the development of certain cancers, such as cervical, oropharyngeal, and anogenital cancers, HPV-144 is not currently considered an oncogenic (cancer-causing) virus. However, its potential role in the development of other skin-related conditions or its interactions with the host immune system are areas that require further research and investigation.\n\nOverall, the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and public health significance of HPV-144 remain relatively understudied compared to more prevalent and well-characterized HPV types. Continued research and surveillance efforts are necessary to better understand the characteristics and impact of this particular HPV type.",
