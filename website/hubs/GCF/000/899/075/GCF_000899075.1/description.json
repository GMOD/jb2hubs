  "description": "Gyrovirus 4 is a species of small, non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus that belongs to the Gyrovirus genus within the Anelloviridae family. The viral genome is approximately 2.3 kilobases in size and encodes three major open reading frames (ORFs) that produce structural and non-structural proteins essential for viral replication and assembly.\n\nGyrovirus 4 primarily infects chickens and has been detected in various domestic poultry species. The virus is believed to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with infected birds shedding the virus in their feces. Gyrovirus 4 has been associated with various clinical manifestations in chickens, including growth retardation, immunosuppression, and increased susceptibility to other infectious agents.\n\nThe exact pathogenic mechanisms and the full impact of Gyrovirus 4 on poultry health and production are still under investigation. However, its identification and characterization have contributed to a better understanding of the diversity and potential significance of avian-associated anelloviruses within the poultry industry.",
