  "description": "Astrovirus MLB3 is a species of virus that belongs to the family Astroviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a nonenveloped, icosahedral capsid structure. Astrovirus MLB3 was first identified in 2012 from a human stool sample in the United States.\n\nThe genome of Astrovirus MLB3 is approximately 6.8 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of the viral structural and nonstructural proteins. The virus is known to primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and can cause acute gastroenteritis, characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\nAstrovirus MLB3 is genetically distinct from other known astrovirus species and is classified as a member of the MLB clade within the Astroviridae family. The virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin, potentially transmitted from animal reservoirs to humans, although its exact mode of transmission and prevalence in human populations are still under investigation.",
