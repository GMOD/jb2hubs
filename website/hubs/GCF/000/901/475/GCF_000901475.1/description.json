  "description": "Astrovirus VA3 is a member of the Astroviridae family, which are non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. Astrovirus VA3 was first discovered in the fecal samples of a child with gastroenteritis in Virginia, United States, in 2009.\n\nThe viral genome of Astrovirus VA3 is approximately 6.8 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral non-structural proteins, while ORF2 encodes the viral capsid protein.\n\nAstrovirus VA3 is classified as a member of the Mamastrovirus genus within the Astroviridae family. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that Astrovirus VA3 is most closely related to other mammalian astroviruses, suggesting a potential zoonotic origin.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission for Astrovirus VA3 is believed to be through the fecal-oral route, similar to other astroviruses. The virus has been detected in various animal species, including humans, pigs, and bats, indicating a potential for cross-species transmission.\n\nThe clinical manifestations associated with Astrovirus VA3 infection are typically mild to moderate gastroenteritis, characterized by symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, more severe cases, including neurological complications, have been reported in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nOverall, Astrovirus VA3 represents an emerging member of the Astroviridae family, and further research is needed to understand its epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential impact on human and animal health.",
