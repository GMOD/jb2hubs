  "description": "STL polyomavirus is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the Polyomaviridae family. It was first discovered in 2018 in a patient with a kidney transplant who developed a polyomavirus-associated nephropathy.\n\nThe viral genome of STL polyomavirus is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 5,000 base pairs. The genome encodes several early and late genes, including the large T antigen and small T antigen, which are crucial for the virus's replication and modulation of host cell functions.\n\nSTL polyomavirus is closely related to other polyomaviruses, such as the well-known BK polyomavirus and JC polyomavirus, which are also known to cause various opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals, including transplant recipients.\n\nThe prevalence and pathogenic potential of STL polyomavirus are still under investigation, as more research is needed to fully understand its epidemiology, clinical significance, and mechanisms of infection and disease development. Continued study of this emerging polyomavirus may provide insights into the diversity and evolution of the Polyomaviridae family and their interactions with the human host.",
