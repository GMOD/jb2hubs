  "description": "Lyssavirus lagos is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, which is part of the Rhabdoviridae family. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects bats and can be transmitted to humans, causing a fatal neurological disease known as rabies.\n\nThe Lyssavirus lagos is one of the several recognized lyssavirus species found in Africa. It was first isolated from a fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) in Nigeria in the 1950s. The virus is believed to be maintained in bat populations, with occasional spillover events leading to human infections.\n\nLike other lyssaviruses, Lyssavirus lagos is transmitted through direct contact with infected saliva, typically through bites or scratches from infected animals. Once the virus enters the human body, it travels along the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system, where it causes inflammation and damage to the brain and spinal cord, leading to the clinical symptoms of rabies.\n\nLyssavirus lagos is considered a rare cause of human rabies, with only a few reported cases. However, its presence in African bat populations highlights the importance of ongoing surveillance and preventive measures to minimize the risk of zoonotic transmission to humans.",
