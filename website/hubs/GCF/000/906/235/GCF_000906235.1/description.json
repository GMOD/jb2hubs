  "description": "Human polyomavirus 12 (HPyV12) is a recently discovered member of the Polyomaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus with an icosahedral capsid structure.\n\nThe viral genome of HPyV12 is a double-stranded, circular DNA molecule of approximately 5.1 kilobase pairs in length. The genome encodes several regulatory and structural proteins, including the large T antigen and small T antigen, which play critical roles in viral replication and host cell manipulation.\n\nHPyV12 was first identified in 2013 from human skin samples, indicating that it may be a commensal virus, commonly found on the human skin without causing any known disease. However, its precise prevalence, tissue tropism, and potential pathogenic role in human health are still under investigation.\n\nSerological studies have suggested that exposure to HPyV12 is relatively common in the human population, with seroprevalence rates ranging from 30% to 70% in various geographical regions. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, transmission, and potential clinical implications of this newly discovered human polyomavirus.",
