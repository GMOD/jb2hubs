  "description": "Human papillomavirus 179 (HPV-179) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various vertebrates, including humans. HPV-179 is one of the many subtypes of human papillomaviruses, which are known to cause a range of benign and malignant lesions in the skin and mucous membranes.\n\nThe HPV-179 genome consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. The viral genome encodes several essential proteins, including the early (E) proteins, which are involved in viral replication and transformation of infected cells, and the late (L) proteins, which form the viral capsid.\n\nLike other HPV types, HPV-179 is primarily transmitted through direct skin-to-skin or sexual contact, and it can establish a persistent infection in the host. The virus has a tropism for epithelial cells, particularly those found in the anogenital region, and can lead to the development of various types of warts or precancerous lesions.\n\nThe clinical significance and epidemiological characteristics of HPV-179 are still under investigation, as it is a relatively newly identified subtype. Ongoing research aims to better understand its prevalence, modes of transmission, and potential association with specific disease outcomes, which may contribute to the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.",
