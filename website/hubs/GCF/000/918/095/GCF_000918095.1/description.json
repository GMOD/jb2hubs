  "description": "Human papillomavirus 178 (HPV 178) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which are small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. HPV 178 is one of the less common and less studied HPV types, belonging to the alpha-papillomavirus genus.\n\nThe viral genome of HPV 178 is approximately 8,000 base pairs in length and encodes several essential proteins, including the early proteins (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) and the late structural proteins (L1 and L2). These proteins play crucial roles in viral replication, gene expression, and the assembly of new viral particles.\n\nHPV 178 is primarily associated with cutaneous warts and other benign skin lesions, typically found on the hands, feet, and other areas of the body. However, the exact prevalence and clinical significance of HPV 178 infection are not well-documented, as it is considered a relatively rare HPV type compared to the more commonly studied high-risk and low-risk HPV strains.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of HPV 178 infection in human populations.",
