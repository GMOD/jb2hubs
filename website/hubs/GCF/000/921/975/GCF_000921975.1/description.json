  "description": "Simian pegivirus (SPgV) is a virus species that belongs to the genus Pegivirus, within the family Flaviviridae. Pegiviruses are a group of non-pathogenic RNA viruses that infect various mammalian species, including primates.\n\nSPgV is primarily found in Old World monkeys, such as African green monkeys and sooty mangabeys. The virus is believed to have co-evolved with its primate hosts and is thought to establish persistent, asymptomatic infections, with the host typically exhibiting no overt clinical signs of disease.\n\nThe SPgV genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule that encodes a polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved into various structural and non-structural viral proteins. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of infected host cells and is primarily transmitted through horizontal routes, such as blood-borne exposure or close contact between individuals.\n\nWhile the exact biological role and impact of SPgV on its primate hosts are not fully understood, the virus serves as an important model for studying the dynamics and evolution of non-pathogenic persistent viral infections in natural reservoir species. Ongoing research continues to provide insights into the complex interactions between pegiviruses and their mammalian hosts.",
