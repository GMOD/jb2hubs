  "description": "The New Jersey polyomavirus-2013 (NJPyV-2013) is a novel polyomavirus that was first discovered in 2013 in a human stool sample collected in New Jersey, United States. Polyomaviruses are a family of small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nThe NJPyV-2013 genome is approximately 5.0 kilobases in length and encodes the typical polyomavirus proteins, including the large T antigen, small T antigen, and the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that NJPyV-2013 is most closely related to other human polyomaviruses, such as the Merkel cell polyomavirus and the KI polyomavirus, but it represents a distinct and previously unidentified species within the Polyomaviridae family.\n\nThe prevalence and distribution of NJPyV-2013 in human populations, as well as its potential pathogenic role, are still under investigation. Further research is needed to determine the epidemiology, tissue tropism, and possible association of NJPyV-2013 with any human diseases or conditions.",
