  "description": "Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) is a member of the genus Vesiculovirus, which belongs to the family Rhabdoviridae. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily infects livestock, such as cattle, horses, and swine.\n\nVSNJV is the causative agent of vesicular stomatitis, a highly contagious viral disease characterized by the formation of vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) on the mouth, tongue, lips, and coronary bands of the hooves. The virus can also infect humans, causing a flu-like illness, but human infections are relatively rare.\n\nThe virus is typically transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their saliva, or contaminated surfaces. It can also be spread by insect vectors, such as sand flies and black flies. The virus enters the host cell by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface and then replicates within the cytoplasm, ultimately leading to the release of new virus particles.\n\nVSNJV is an important pathogen in veterinary medicine, as it can cause significant economic losses in affected livestock populations. Diagnosis is typically made through laboratory tests, such as virus isolation, serological assays, or molecular techniques. Prevention and control measures focus on biosecurity, quarantine, and vaccination of susceptible animals.",
