  "description": "Bufavirus-3 is a newly discovered member of the Protoparvovirus genus within the Parvoviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus.\n\nThe genome of Bufavirus-3 consists of approximately 5 kilobases and encodes two major open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes the non-structural proteins, while the second ORF encodes the viral capsid proteins.\n\nBufavirus-3 was initially identified in stool samples collected from children with diarrhea in Burkina Faso, Africa. Subsequent studies have detected the presence of Bufavirus-3 in various geographical regions, suggesting a widespread distribution.\n\nThe exact mode of transmission and the clinical significance of Bufavirus-3 infection in humans are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health implications of this newly discovered virus.",
