  "description": "Mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the genus Orthoreovirus within the family Reoviridae. It is a member of the Mammalian orthoreovirus species, which are commonly found in various mammalian hosts, including humans.\n\nThe virus particle is approximately 80-85 nanometers in diameter and has an icosahedral capsid structure. The genome of MRV3 consists of 10 segments of double-stranded RNA, which encode various viral proteins involved in replication, assembly, and host interactions.\n\nMRV3 is primarily associated with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in humans and other mammals. It can cause a range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic infections to more severe conditions, such as gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and meningitis, depending on the host's immune status and other factors.\n\nThe virus is known to have a wide host range, infecting a variety of mammalian species, including rodents, cattle, and non-human primates. It is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, as well as through respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.\n\nOngoing research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of MRV3 pathogenesis, its epidemiology, and the potential development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions to better manage and control infections caused by this virus.",
