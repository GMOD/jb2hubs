  "description": "The Sosuga virus is a newly discovered member of the Paramyxoviridae family, first identified in 2017 from samples collected in Uganda. It is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Henipavirus, which includes other notable zoonotic viruses such as Hendra virus and Nipah virus.\n\nThe Sosuga virus is closely related to, but distinct from, the Mojiang virus, which was previously discovered in China. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Sosuga virus likely originated from bats, which are known reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses.\n\nLimited information is available about the epidemiology, pathogenicity, and clinical manifestations associated with Sosuga virus infections in humans. However, given its close genetic relationship to other highly pathogenic henipaviruses, it is suspected to have the potential to cause severe and potentially fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans. Further research is needed to fully characterize the properties and public health implications of this newly discovered virus.",
