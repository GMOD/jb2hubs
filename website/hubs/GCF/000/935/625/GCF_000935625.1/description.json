  "description": "Nanorana parkeri, also known as the Parker's frog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Dicroglossidae. It is native to the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions in China, India, Nepal, and Bhutan.\n\nNanorana parkeri is a small-sized frog, typically measuring around 3-5 centimeters in length. It has a robust and stocky build, with a broad head and short limbs. The skin is smooth, and the coloration can vary from shades of brown to gray, often with darker patches or spots. This species is adapted to the high-altitude environments of the Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabits streams, lakes, and other aquatic habitats.\n\nNanorana parkeri is primarily a nocturnal species and is known to be a skilled climber, able to move efficiently on rocks and vegetation near its aquatic habitats. It feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders. The reproductive biology of this species involves the males calling to attract females, and the subsequent laying of eggs in water, where the tadpoles develop and undergo metamorphosis.\n\nNanorana parkeri is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is relatively common within its range. However, habitat loss and degradation due to human activities, such as agricultural expansion and infrastructure development, can pose potential threats to the species' populations.",
