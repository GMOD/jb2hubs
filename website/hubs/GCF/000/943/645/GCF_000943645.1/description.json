  "description": "Orthomarburgvirus marburgense is a species of filovirus, a family of viruses known for causing severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fevers in humans and other primates. This virus is the causative agent of Marburg virus disease, also known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever.\n\nOrthomarburgvirus marburgense is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. It has a filamentous, sometimes branched, or sometimes circular morphology, with a diameter of approximately 80-100 nanometers. The viral genome is approximately 19,000 nucleotides in length and encodes seven structural proteins, including the glycoprotein (GP), nucleoprotein (NP), and polymerase (L) proteins, which are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected animals, such as fruit bats, which are believed to be the natural reservoir. Human-to-human transmission can occur through exposure to bodily fluids or contaminated materials from infected individuals. Marburg virus disease is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and unexplained bleeding or bruising.\n\nOrthomarburgvirus marburgense is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 pathogen, indicating it poses a severe risk to human health and requires the highest level of containment and safety protocols for research and diagnostic purposes.",
