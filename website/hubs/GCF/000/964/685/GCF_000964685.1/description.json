  "description": "Anaplasma phagocytophilum str. Webster is a strain of a tick-borne bacterial pathogen that belongs to the genus Anaplasma. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium that primarily infects and replicates within neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, in its mammalian hosts.\n\nThe Anaplasma phagocytophilum str. Webster is known to cause the disease called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), which is a tick-borne illness characterized by flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache, and muscle aches. The strain was first isolated from a patient in Webster County, Missouri, United States, hence the name \"str. Webster.\"\n\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum is transmitted to humans and other mammals, such as deer and rodents, through the bite of infected ticks, primarily from the Ixodes genus. The bacteria enter the host's neutrophils, where they form distinctive intracellular inclusions known as morulae, which are a characteristic feature of the infection.\n\nDiagnosis of Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection typically involves serological testing or molecular techniques, such as PCR, to detect the presence of the bacteria or its genetic material. Treatment for HGA generally involves the use of antibiotics, such as doxycycline, which are effective in clearing the infection.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of Anaplasma phagocytophilum str. Webster is crucial for the development of effective prevention and control strategies against the disease it causes, particularly in areas where the tick vectors are present.",
