  "description": "Apteryx mantelli mantelli, commonly known as the North Island brown kiwi, is a subspecies of the brown kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) native to the North Island of New Zealand. It is a flightless, nocturnal bird belonging to the kiwi family, Apterygidae.\n\nThe North Island brown kiwi is a small, plump bird with a distinctive long, slender, and downward-curved bill. It has a dense, soft, and hair-like plumage that is predominantly brown in color, with varying shades of gray, reddish-brown, and black. Unlike other kiwi species, the North Island brown kiwi lacks a visible tail.\n\nApteryx mantelli mantelli is known for its unique adaptations to its nocturnal and ground-dwelling lifestyle. It has a highly developed sense of smell, which it uses to locate its prey, primarily consisting of invertebrates, small vertebrates, and plant matter. The bird's small, vestigial wings are not used for flight but rather for balance and communication during courtship displays.\n\nThis subspecies is found in various habitats within the North Island, including native forests, scrublands, and farmlands. It is considered a national icon of New Zealand and is the subject of ongoing conservation efforts to protect its declining population due to factors such as habitat loss, predation by introduced mammals, and human disturbance.",
