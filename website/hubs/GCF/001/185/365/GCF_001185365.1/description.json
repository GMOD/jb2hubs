  "description": "Pantherophis guttatus, commonly known as the corn snake, is a non-venomous colubrid snake species native to the southeastern and central United States. It is a member of the genus Pantherophis, which includes several species of North American rat snakes.\n\nCorn snakes are known for their distinctive pattern of reddish-orange blotches on a background color that can range from tan to gray. This camouflage coloration helps them blend in with the natural environment, providing protection from predators. They are relatively small to medium-sized snakes, typically reaching lengths between 60 and 150 cm.\n\nCorn snakes are primarily terrestrial and arboreal, spending time both on the ground and in trees or bushes. They are excellent climbers and often use their tails to grip onto branches or other structures. Their diet consists mainly of small rodents, such as mice and rats, as well as birds and their eggs.\n\nReproduction in corn snakes involves an elaborate courtship ritual, followed by the female laying a clutch of 12-24 eggs in a suitable nesting site, such as a rotting log or a burrow. The eggs hatch after an incubation period of approximately 60 days, and the young snakes are independent from birth.\n\nCorn snakes are popular as pets due to their docile nature, ease of care, and striking appearance. They are also valued in the wild for their role in controlling rodent populations, which can be important in agricultural and residential areas.",
