  "description": "Aspergillus nomiae NRRL 13137 is a species of filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in Nigeria, Africa.\n\nAspergillus nomiae is a xerophilic (tolerant of low water activity) and thermotolerant fungus, capable of growing at high temperatures and low water availability. It produces greenish-yellow to brown-colored conidiophores (asexual reproductive structures) and conidia (asexual spores).\n\nGenetically, Aspergillus nomiae is closely related to other members of the Aspergillus section Fumigati, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, a well-known opportunistic pathogen. However, Aspergillus nomiae is not commonly associated with human infections, and its ecological role and potential applications are still under investigation.\n\nThis strain, NRRL 13137, is a reference or type strain that has been deposited in the culture collection of the Agricultural Research Service (NRRL) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). It serves as a representative isolate for further studies on the biology, taxonomy, and potential uses of Aspergillus nomiae.",
