  "description": "Austrofundulus limnaeus is a species of killifish found in Venezuela. It belongs to the family Rivulidae, which is a group of small, freshwater fish native to South America.\n\nAustrofundulus limnaeus is a small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 5-6 centimeters. It has an elongated, cylindrical body shape and a large, terminal mouth. The fish's coloration can vary, but it is often observed with a brownish or olive-green back, while the belly and fins are typically lighter in color.\n\nThis species is found in various freshwater habitats, such as pools, swamps, and slow-moving streams, within its limited geographic range in Venezuela. Austrofundulus limnaeus is known to be an annual fish, meaning its life cycle is adapted to the seasonal fluctuations of its habitat, with the adults dying after spawning and the offspring developing rapidly to mature and reproduce within a single year.\n\nAs a member of the Rivulidae family, Austrofundulus limnaeus shares many characteristics with other killifish, including their unique breeding behaviors and the ability to survive in temporary or ephemeral aquatic environments.",
