  "description": "Dufourea novaeangliae is a species of small bee that belongs to the family Halictidae, commonly known as sweat bees. This species is native to the northeastern United States, particularly in the New England region.\n\nDufourea novaeangliae is a solitary bee, meaning that each female constructs and provisions her own nest, rather than living in a colony with a shared nest. The species is known to exhibit a range of nesting behaviors, including burrowing in the soil or utilizing pre-existing cavities.\n\nThe physical characteristics of Dufourea novaeangliae include a small body size, typically around 5-7 millimeters in length. The bees have a primarily black or dark-colored body, with some pale-colored hairs or bands on the abdomen. Their wings are transparent, and they possess the typical morphological features of sweat bees, such as specialized pollen-collecting structures on their hind legs.\n\nDufourea novaeangliae is known to be a generalist forager, collecting pollen and nectar from a variety of flowering plants in its natural habitat. This species plays a role in the pollination of various plant species, contributing to the overall ecosystem function in the regions where it is found.",
