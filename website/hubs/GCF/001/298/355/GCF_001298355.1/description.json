  "description": "Papilio machaon, commonly known as the Old World swallowtail or common yellow swallowtail, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Papilionidae. It is a large, distinctive butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 80-100 millimeters.\n\nThe wings of Papilio machaon are predominantly yellow in color, with distinctive black markings and a pair of \"tails\" extending from the hindwings. The upperside of the wings features a black border and a series of yellow spots, while the underside is paler in color with more prominent black markings.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including grasslands, meadows, and open woodlands. The larvae, or caterpillars, of Papilio machaon feed primarily on plants in the family Apiaceae, such as fennel, dill, and carrot.\n\nPapilio machaon is known for its unique defense mechanism, where the larvae can extend a pair of orange, forked organs called \"osmeterium\" from behind their heads when threatened, which emit a foul-smelling secretion to deter predators.\n\nThe life cycle of Papilio machaon includes four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). The species is known to have multiple broods per year, with the number varying depending on the geographical location and climatic conditions.",
