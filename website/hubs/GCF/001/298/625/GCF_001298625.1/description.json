  "description": "Saccharomyces eubayanus is a species of yeast that belongs to the Saccharomyces genus. It is a close relative of the well-known brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and was first discovered in 2011 in Patagonia, South America.\n\nS. eubayanus is a cryotolerant yeast, meaning it can thrive in cold environments. It is believed to have been a key contributor to the development of the lager beer style, as it is thought to have naturally hybridized with S. cerevisiae to produce the hybrid yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus, which is used in the production of lager beers.\n\nGenetically, S. eubayanus has a haploid genome size of approximately 11.5 Mb, and it is characterized by its ability to ferment a wide range of sugars, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose. This versatility makes it an interesting subject for research and potential applications in the biotechnology and brewing industries.\n\nOverall, the discovery of S. eubayanus has provided valuable insights into the evolutionary history and diversity of the Saccharomyces genus, and its unique characteristics continue to be explored for their potential industrial and scientific applications.",
