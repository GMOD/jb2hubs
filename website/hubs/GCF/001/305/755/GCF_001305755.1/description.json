They have sturdy, muscular bodies and are known for their sure-footedness and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Donkeys are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses, shrubs, and other vegetation.\n\nBehaviorally, donkeys are known for their intelligence, docility, and hardiness. They are often used as pack animals, for transportation, and in agricultural work due to their strength and adaptability to various terrains and climates. Donkeys have played an important role in human history, serving as valuable working animals in many cultures around the world.",
