  "description": "Human papillomavirus 163 (HPV163) is a newly discovered member of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family, which is a group of DNA viruses that infect the skin and mucous membranes of humans. HPV163 is classified within the Alphapapillomavirus genus, which includes many HPV types associated with various types of warts and lesions.\n\nThe genome of HPV163 consists of a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other HPVs, the viral genome encodes several essential proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and the assembly of new viral particles.\n\nHPV163 is believed to be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated surfaces. It has been detected in a small number of clinical samples, primarily from individuals with skin lesions or warts. However, the specific pathogenic potential and clinical significance of HPV163 infection are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance are necessary to better characterize the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and potential public health implications associated with this newly identified human papillomavirus.",
