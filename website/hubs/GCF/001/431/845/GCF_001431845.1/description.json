  "description": "Calidris pugnax, commonly known as the Ruff, is a species of wading bird belonging to the sandpiper family. It is a medium-sized shorebird with a distinctive plumage that varies greatly between individuals, particularly during the breeding season.\n\nThe Ruff is characterized by its long, slender bill and legs, and its ability to undergo dramatic changes in appearance during the breeding season. Males develop elaborate ruff-like feathers around their necks, which can be white, black, chestnut, or a combination of these colors. The females, known as Reeves, have a more subdued plumage of brown, gray, and white.\n\nRuffs are known for their unique mating behavior, where males gather in lekking sites and engage in elaborate displays and courtship rituals to attract females. These displays involve the males puffing out their ruffs, spreading their tails, and performing various postures and vocalizations to establish dominance and secure mating opportunities.\n\nThe Ruff is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is a migratory species, breeding in the northern parts of its range and wintering in more temperate and tropical regions. They primarily feed on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and mollusks, which they forage for in shallow water and mudflats.\n\nConservation-wise, the Ruff is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although some local populations may face threats from habitat loss and hunting.",
