  "description": "Cocal virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Vesiculovirus within the family Rhabdoviridae. It is primarily transmitted by sand flies and causes a disease known as vesicular stomatitis in various livestock animals, including cattle, horses, and pigs.\n\nThe Cocal virus particle has a bullet-shaped morphology and is approximately 180 nm in length and 75 nm in diameter. The viral genome is approximately 11.1 kilobases in size and encodes five major structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the glycoprotein (G), and the large protein (L), which is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nCocal virus was first isolated in 1956 from sand flies collected in the Cocal region of Brazil. Since then, it has been reported in various parts of South and Central America, causing sporadic outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis in livestock. The virus can be transmitted to humans, but human infections are generally mild and self-limiting, often resulting in flu-like symptoms.\n\nCocal virus is considered an important veterinary pathogen due to its potential to cause significant economic losses in the livestock industry. Effective control measures, such as vaccination and vector control, are essential to prevent and manage outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis caused by this virus.",
