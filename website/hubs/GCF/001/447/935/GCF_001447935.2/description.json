  "description": "Debaryomyces fabryi is a species of yeast that belongs to the Debaryomyces genus. It is a member of the Saccharomycetaceae family, which is a group of ascomycete fungi.\n\nDebaryomyces fabryi is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically spherical or oval-shaped, and can range in size from 2-5 micrometers in diameter.\n\nThis yeast species is known to be found in various environmental niches, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of animals. It has been isolated from a variety of sources, such as fermented food products and clinical samples.\n\nDebaryomyces fabryi is considered a relatively rare species, and its physiological and ecological characteristics are not yet fully understood. However, it is known to be able to grow in a wide range of temperature and pH conditions, and may possess the ability to utilize a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources for energy and growth.\n\nFurther research is still needed to fully elucidate the taxonomy, genomics, and potential applications of this understudied yeast species.",
