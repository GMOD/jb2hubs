  "description": "Nothobranchius furzeri, commonly known as the Turquoise killifish or the Furzer's killifish, is a species of annual killifish native to southeastern Africa. It is found in temporary pools and wetlands in parts of Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Nothobranchius furzeri is a small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 6 centimeters (2.4 inches). It has a distinctive turquoise-blue coloration with reddish-orange fins, especially in adult males. The species is known for its short lifespan, living only a few months in the wild, which is an adaptation to its ephemeral habitat.\n\nNothobranchius furzeri is an annual fish, meaning it completes its entire life cycle within a single year. The fish's eggs can survive the dry season by entering a state of dormancy called diapause, hatching only when the rains return and refill the temporary pools. This remarkable adaptation allows the species to thrive in these harsh, unpredictable environments.\n\nThe Nothobranchius furzeri has become a popular model organism in the study of aging and longevity, as it displays a rapid aging process that can provide insights into the mechanisms of senescence in vertebrates.",
