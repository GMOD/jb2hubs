  "description": "Polistes dominula, commonly known as the European paper wasp or the common wasp, is a species of social wasp found throughout Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the genus Polistes, which is known for its paper nests constructed from chewed wood pulp and saliva.\n\nPolistes dominula colonies are typically small, with a queen and a few dozen workers. The queen is responsible for founding the nest and laying eggs, while the workers perform tasks such as foraging, nest construction, and brood care. These wasps are often seen hovering around flowers, feeding on nectar and hunting for caterpillars and other insects to provision their larvae.\n\nPhysically, Polistes dominula workers are approximately 15-20 millimeters in length, with a slender, elongated body and a distinctive yellow and black striped pattern. They have two pairs of wings and a sting that they can use to defend their nest or deter potential predators.\n\nPolistes dominula is considered an invasive species in some regions, as it can outcompete native wasp species and potentially cause problems for humans due to its tendency to build nests in close proximity to human habitats. However, they also play an important role in many ecosystems as pollinators and natural pest control agents.",
