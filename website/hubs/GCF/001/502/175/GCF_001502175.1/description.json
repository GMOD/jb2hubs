  "description": "Tupaia hepatovirus A is a species of virus that belongs to the family Hepeviridae. It is primarily found in the liver of the tree shrew (Tupaia), a small mammal native to Southeast Asia.\n\nThe virus is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. It has a genome of approximately 7.2 kilobases in length, which encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) responsible for the production of viral proteins essential for its replication and infection.\n\nTupaia hepatovirus A is closely related to the human hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world. However, Tupaia hepatovirus A is not known to infect humans and is primarily confined to the tree shrew population.\n\nThe virus is believed to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route, with tree shrews acquiring the infection through contaminated food or water sources. The infection can cause liver inflammation and other hepatic disorders in the affected animals.\n\nOngoing research on Tupaia hepatovirus A provides valuable insights into the evolution and host specificity of hepeviruses, which can contribute to a better understanding of the potential zoonotic transmission of related viruses and the development of effective prevention and control strategies.",
