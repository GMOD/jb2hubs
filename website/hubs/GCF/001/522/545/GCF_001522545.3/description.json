It is widely distributed across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is one of the most common and well-studied bird species in the world.\n\nThe great tit is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring 12-14 cm in length and weighing between 16-22 grams. It has a distinctive black head with white cheeks, a yellow breast, and olive-green upper parts. The species is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including deciduous and coniferous forests, parks, and urban areas.\n\nGreat tits are omnivorous, feeding on a diverse range of invertebrates, such as caterpillars, spiders, and insects, as well as seeds and berries. They are known for their problem-solving abilities, and have been observed using tools to extract food from hard-to-reach places.\n\nParus major is an important model species in the study of avian ecology, behavior, and evolution. Researchers have gained valuable insights into topics such as social behavior, foraging strategies, and the effects of climate change on bird populations through extensive research on this species.\n\nOverall, the great tit is a well-adapted and successful bird species that plays a crucial role in the ecosystems it inhabits, and continues to be a valuable subject of scientific investigation.",
