  "description": "Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is known for its ability to cause the serious foodborne illness listeriosis. This opportunistic pathogen is widely distributed in the environment, found in soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals, including livestock and humans.\n\nListeria monocytogenes is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen. It is also psychrotrophic, capable of growing at refrigeration temperatures, which allows it to thrive in food processing environments and refrigerated foods.\n\nThe bacterium is known for its unique ability to invade and replicate within host cells, including human epithelial cells, macrophages, and other cell types. This intracellular lifestyle allows Listeria to evade the host's immune system and disseminate throughout the body.\n\nListeriosis, the disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes, can be particularly severe in immunocompromised individuals, pregnant women, newborns, and the elderly. Symptoms can range from mild gastrointestinal illness to life-threatening conditions such as meningitis, sepsis, and fetal loss in pregnant women.\n\nDue to the serious nature of listeriosis and the resilience of Listeria monocytogenes, food safety and public health authorities worldwide have implemented strict control measures to monitor and mitigate the risks associated with this pathogen in the food supply.",
