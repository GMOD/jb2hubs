  "description": "Coturnix japonica, commonly known as the Japanese quail or East Asian quail, is a small ground-dwelling bird species belonging to the family Phasianidae. This species is native to East Asia, with its natural range spanning from Japan to eastern China and the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe Japanese quail is a relatively small quail, measuring approximately 16-17 cm in length and weighing between 90-130 grams. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the males having a more distinctive plumage pattern, featuring a reddish-brown head, white eyebrows, and a black and white striped pattern on the throat and breast.\n\nCoturnix japonica is known for its adaptability and has been successfully domesticated for both commercial and research purposes. These quails are commonly used in the poultry industry for their meat and eggs, as well as in scientific research due to their relatively short generation time and ease of handling.\n\nBehaviorally, the Japanese quail is a social species, forming small flocks and engaging in various vocalizations, including the characteristic \"co-tur-nix\" call that has given the species its scientific name. These quails are primarily ground-foragers, feeding on a variety of seeds, grains, and small invertebrates.\n\nThe conservation status of Coturnix japonica is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as the species is widespread and abundant throughout its native range.",
