  "description": "Cyphomyrmex costatus is a species of ant belonging to the fungus-growing ant genus Cyphomyrmex. These ants are native to Central and South America, where they play an important role in the ecosystem as part of the leaf-cutting ant community.\n\nCyphomyrmex costatus is a small-sized ant, typically measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. They have a distinct appearance, with a rounded, dome-shaped head and a ridged or \"costate\" exoskeleton, which gives them their species name. These ants are known to cultivate and consume a specific type of fungus as their primary food source, which they grow in specialized underground chambers.\n\nLike other fungus-growing ants, Cyphomyrmex costatus engages in a mutualistic relationship with the fungus they cultivate. The ants provide the fungus with a stable environment and a steady supply of plant material as a food source, while the fungus, in turn, provides the ants with nutrients essential for their survival and growth.\n\nCyphomyrmex costatus is an important part of the tropical forest ecosystem, contributing to the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients. Their fungus-growing activities also have potential applications in areas such as biotechnology and sustainable agriculture.",
