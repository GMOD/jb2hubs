  "description": "Norovirus GIII, also known as bovine norovirus, is a member of the Norovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects cattle and other ruminant animals.\n\nThe Norovirus GIII genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and minor capsid proteins, respectively.\n\nNorovirus GIII is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, with contaminated food and water being the most common sources of infection. The virus can cause gastroenteritis in infected animals, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps.\n\nNorovirus GIII is genetically distinct from the human noroviruses that typically cause outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis in humans, and it is not known to be a significant human pathogen. However, the potential for cross-species transmission and the emergence of novel recombinant strains is an area of ongoing research and surveillance.",
