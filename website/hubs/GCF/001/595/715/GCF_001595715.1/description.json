  "description": "Norovirus GIV, also known as the Norwalk-like virus, is a species of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Caliciviridae family. It is one of the most common causes of acute gastroenteritis, or \"stomach flu,\" worldwide.\n\nNorovirus GIV is a small, non-enveloped virus with an icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode the viral structural and non-structural proteins.\n\nNorovirus GIV is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, with contaminated food and water being the most common sources of infection. The virus is highly contagious and can cause outbreaks in a variety of settings, including healthcare facilities, schools, and cruise ships.\n\nSymptoms of norovirus GIV infection typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and can last for several days. While the illness is usually self-limiting, it can be severe, particularly in young children, older adults, and individuals with compromised immune systems.\n\nPrevention and control of norovirus GIV outbreaks rely on good hygiene practices, such as thorough hand washing and proper food handling and preparation, as well as the implementation of effective infection control measures in healthcare and other settings.",
