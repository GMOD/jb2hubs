  "description": "Plasmodium gaboni is a species of malaria parasite that infects wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Central Africa. It is closely related to the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the most deadly form of malaria in humans.\n\nPlasmodium gaboni is a single-celled eukaryotic organism that belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa. It has a complex life cycle that involves both mosquito vectors and primate hosts. The parasite is transmitted by infected Anopheles mosquitoes, which inject sporozoites into the host's bloodstream during a blood meal.\n\nOnce inside the host, the sporozoites travel to the liver, where they undergo asexual replication, forming merozoites that are released back into the bloodstream. These merozoites then invade red blood cells, initiating the symptomatic, blood-stage of the infection.\n\nWithin the red blood cells, the parasites undergo further asexual replication, eventually causing the host cell to rupture and release more merozoites, which can then infect additional red blood cells. Some of these merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes, which can be taken up by a feeding mosquito, completing the life cycle.\n\nPlasmodium gaboni is of particular interest to researchers studying the evolution and origins of human malaria, as it provides insights into the genetic diversity and host-parasite relationships within the Plasmodium genus.",
