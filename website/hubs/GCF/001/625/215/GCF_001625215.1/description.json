  "description": "Daucus carota subsp. sativus, commonly known as the carrot, is a subspecies of the wild carrot (Daucus carota) that has been cultivated for its edible, root vegetable. It is a biennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Apiaceae family.\n\nThe carrot plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm and has a rosette of finely divided, feathery leaves. The root, which is the edible part, is typically orange in color, although other varieties with purple, yellow, or white roots also exist. The root is a taproot that can grow up to 20 cm long and 5 cm in diameter.\n\nCarrots are an important source of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, particularly beta-carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin A. They are commonly used in various culinary applications, including soups, salads, and as a side dish.\n\nDaucus carota subsp. sativus is widely cultivated around the world, with China, the United States, and Russia being among the largest producers. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and requires well-drained, sandy soils for optimal growth.",
