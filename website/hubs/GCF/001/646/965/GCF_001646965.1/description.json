  "description": "Fonsecaea nubica is a species of dematiaceous (dark-pigmented) fungus that belongs to the order Chaetothyriales. It is a causative agent of chromoblastomycosis, a chronic skin and subcutaneous tissue infection.\n\nFonsecaea nubica is characterized by the production of dark-colored, septate hyphae and sclerotic bodies (also known as \"muriform cells\" or \"Medlar bodies\") in infected tissues. These sclerotic bodies are thick-walled, melanized structures that are considered a hallmark of chromoblastomycosis infections.\n\nThe fungus is found in tropical and subtropical regions, and it is typically associated with soil and decaying plant matter. Infection in humans occurs through traumatic inoculation of the fungus into the skin, often from thorns, splinters, or other environmental exposures.\n\nFonsecaea nubica is a slow-growing fungus in culture, producing olivaceous to brown colonies with a velvety texture. Microscopically, it exhibits septate, branched hyphae and dark-pigmented conidiophores that give rise to single-celled, brown conidia.\n\nDiagnosis of Fonsecaea nubica infections relies on clinical presentation, histopathological examination, and fungal culture. Treatment often involves a combination of antifungal drugs, such as itraconazole or terbinafine, along with surgical management of the lesions.",
