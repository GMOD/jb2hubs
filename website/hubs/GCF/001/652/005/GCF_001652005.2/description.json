  "description": "Ceratina calcarata is a species of small carpenter bee that belongs to the family Apidae. These bees are found in North America, ranging from Canada to the southern United States.\n\nCeratina calcarata is a solitary bee, meaning that each female constructs and provisions her own nest. They typically nest in the pithy stems of plants, such as blackberry, raspberry, and elderberry. The female bee excavates a tunnel within the plant stem, creating a series of brood cells where she lays her eggs and provides a food source for the developing larvae.\n\nThese bees are relatively small, typically measuring between 5-8 millimeters in length. They have a metallic-colored body, often with a greenish or bluish hue. Ceratina calcarata is an important pollinator, contributing to the pollination of various flowering plants in their natural habitats.\n\nThe species is known for its unique behavior of \"necrophoresis,\" where the female bee carries the dead body of a male bee to the nest entrance, likely to prevent the spread of pathogens or parasites within the nest.\n\nOverall, Ceratina calcarata is a valuable component of local ecosystems, contributing to the pollination of plants and maintaining a balanced insect community.",
