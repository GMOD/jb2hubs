  "description": "Saitoella complicata NRRL Y-17804 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nSaitoella complicata is a member of the genus Saitoella, which was first described in 1995. The species NRRL Y-17804 was isolated from a soil sample collected in Japan. It is characterized by its ability to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from around 10°C to 40°C, and its ability to assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources.\n\nMorphologically, Saitoella complicata NRRL Y-17804 has spherical to oval-shaped cells, typically measuring between 3-6 micrometers in diameter. The cells can form pseudohyphae, which are elongated, branching structures that resemble fungal hyphae.\n\nGenetically, Saitoella complicata NRRL Y-17804 has a haploid genome, and its DNA sequence has been analyzed and compared to other related yeast species. This information has been used to study the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic placement of the Saitoella genus within the Ascomycota phylum.\n\nOverall, Saitoella complicata NRRL Y-17804 is a versatile and well-studied yeast species that has been used in various research and biotechnological applications, including the study of yeast physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology.",
