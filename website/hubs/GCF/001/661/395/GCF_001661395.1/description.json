  "description": "Hyphopichia burtonii NRRL Y-1933 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota, class Saccharomycetes, and order Saccharomycetales. It was initially isolated from soil samples collected in the United States.\n\nHyphopichia burtonii NRRL Y-1933 is a hyphae-forming yeast, meaning it can produce septate hyphae, which are branched, tubular structures typical of fungi. This species can assimilate and ferment a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, among others.\n\nMorphologically, Hyphopichia burtonii NRRL Y-1933 cells are oval to ellipsoidal in shape and can reproduce both asexually, through budding, and sexually, through the formation of ascospores. The ascospores are typically smooth, spherical, and can range in number from one to four per ascus.\n\nGenetically, the species has been characterized and its genome has been sequenced, providing insights into its phylogenetic relationships and potential metabolic capabilities. Hyphopichia burtonii NRRL Y-1933 has been studied for its potential applications in various biotechnological processes, such as the production of enzymes or the bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass.",
