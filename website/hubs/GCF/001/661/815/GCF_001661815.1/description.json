  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 18 (TTMV-18) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. This virus is classified as a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family.\n\nTTMV-18 is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it lacks an outer lipid membrane. The viral genome is circular and approximately 2.8 kilobases in size. The genome encodes for several proteins, including the viral capsid protein, which is responsible for the viral particle's structure.\n\nTTMV-18 is widely distributed in the human population and has been detected in various human samples, including blood, feces, and respiratory secretions. The virus is believed to be ubiquitous and persistent, meaning that it can establish a lifelong infection in the host.\n\nWhile the exact role and pathogenicity of TTMV-18 in human health are not fully understood, it is generally considered a commensal virus, meaning it coexists with the host without causing overt disease. However, some studies have suggested potential associations between TTMV-18 and certain medical conditions, such as immunosuppression or liver diseases, although more research is needed to establish definitive causal relationships.",
