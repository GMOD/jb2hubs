  "description": "Ogataea polymorpha is a species of yeast belonging to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a methylotrophic yeast, meaning it can utilize methanol as a sole carbon and energy source. The cells of O. polymorpha are typically spherical or ellipsoidal in shape and reproduce asexually through budding.\n\nO. polymorpha is known for its ability to produce and accumulate high levels of certain proteins, including recombinant proteins, within its cells. This characteristic has made it a useful model organism and host for heterologous protein expression in biotechnological and industrial applications.\n\nThe genome of O. polymorpha has been sequenced, and studies have revealed insights into its unique metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms related to methanol utilization and protein production. Ongoing research continues to explore the potential of this yeast species for various biotechnological and bioindustrial processes.",
