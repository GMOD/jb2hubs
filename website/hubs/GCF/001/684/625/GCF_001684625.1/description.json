  "description": "Enterovirus A114 is a member of the genus Enterovirus within the family Picornaviridae. It is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects humans.\n\nEnterovirus A114 is classified as a member of the Enterovirus A species, which includes various human enteroviruses known to cause a range of clinical manifestations, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease, herpangina, and aseptic meningitis.\n\nThe virus particle of Enterovirus A114 is approximately 30 nanometers in diameter and has an icosahedral capsid structure. The viral genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is processed into the structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nEnterovirus A114 is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, as well as respiratory droplets. After initial infection, the virus can replicate in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory system, and in some cases, it may spread to the central nervous system, causing more severe clinical manifestations.\n\nResearch on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical significance of Enterovirus A114 is ongoing, as the understanding of its impact on human health continues to evolve.",
