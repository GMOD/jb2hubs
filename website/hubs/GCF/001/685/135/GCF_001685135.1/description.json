  "description": "Manis javanica, commonly known as the Sunda pangolin or Malayan pangolin, is a species of pangolin native to Southeast Asia. Pangolins are unique mammals known for their distinctive scaly exterior, which is their primary defense mechanism against predators.\n\nThe Sunda pangolin is a medium-sized pangolin, typically measuring between 60 to 90 cm in length, including the tail. It has a stocky body covered in overlapping, keratinized scales that are brownish-grey in color. These scales provide excellent protection and can be raised as a defensive posture when the animal feels threatened.\n\nSunda pangolins are primarily nocturnal and arboreal, spending much of their time in the trees foraging for their primary food source: ants and termites. They have a long, sticky tongue that can extend up to 40 cm, allowing them to efficiently extract insects from their nests and burrows.\n\nReproduction in Sunda pangolins is relatively slow, with females giving birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of around 140 days. The young pangolins are born with soft scales that harden as they grow older.\n\nThe Sunda pangolin is classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to a significant decline in population caused by illegal poaching and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and ecologically important species.",
