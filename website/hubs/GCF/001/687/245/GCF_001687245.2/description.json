  "description": "Rhagoletis zephyria is a species of tephritid fruit fly native to North America. It is commonly known as the western cherry fruit fly or the western cherry maggot.\n\nR. zephyria is a small, yellowish-brown fly with dark bands on its wings. The larvae, or maggots, of this species feed exclusively on the fruits of various cherry species, including wild black cherries (Prunus serotina) and chokecherries (Prunus virginiana).\n\nThe life cycle of R. zephyria begins with the adult females laying their eggs inside the developing cherry fruits. Upon hatching, the larvae burrow into the flesh of the fruit, feeding and developing until they are ready to pupate. The pupae then overwinter in the soil, emerging as adult flies the following spring to continue the cycle.\n\nThis fly is considered a significant agricultural pest, as its larval feeding can cause significant damage and spoilage to commercial cherry crops. Management strategies often involve the use of insecticides or the deployment of other integrated pest management techniques to control R. zephyria populations and mitigate its impact on cherry production.",
