  "description": "Cryptococcus wingfieldii CBS 7118 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the genus Cryptococcus. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Africa and named after Professor Michael J. Wingfield, a renowned mycologist and plant pathologist.\n\nCryptococcus wingfieldii CBS 7118 is a basidiomycete fungus, meaning it belongs to the Basidiomycota phylum, which includes mushrooms, puffballs, and other fungi that produce spores on club-like structures called basidia. It is a non-pathogenic, saprophytic organism, meaning it feeds on dead or decaying organic matter in the environment.\n\nCells of Cryptococcus wingfieldii CBS 7118 are typically spherical or ellipsoidal in shape, measuring between 5-10 μm in diameter. The fungus reproduces asexually through the formation of budding yeast cells. It is able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from around 10°C to 35°C, and can tolerate a variety of environmental conditions.\n\nWhile Cryptococcus wingfieldii CBS 7118 is not known to cause any diseases in humans or other organisms, it is of interest to researchers studying the diversity and ecology of fungal communities in soil and other natural environments.",
