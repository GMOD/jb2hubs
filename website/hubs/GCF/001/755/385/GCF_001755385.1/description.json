  "description": "Primate norovirus is a type of norovirus that primarily infects various species of primates, including humans, chimpanzees, and other non-human primates. Noroviruses are a group of highly contagious RNA viruses that belong to the Caliciviridae family.\n\nPrimate noroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are recognized for their ability to cause acute gastroenteritis, characterized by symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These viruses are typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either directly from person-to-person or indirectly through contaminated food or water.\n\nGenomic studies have revealed that primate noroviruses share a high degree of genetic similarity, suggesting a common evolutionary origin among the different primate species they infect. Understanding the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of primate noroviruses is an active area of research, as it can provide insights into the cross-species transmission dynamics and potential zoonotic risks associated with these viruses.",
