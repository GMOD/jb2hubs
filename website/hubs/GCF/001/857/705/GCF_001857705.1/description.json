  "description": "Panthera pardus, commonly known as the leopard, is a large feline species that is native to various regions of Africa and Asia. It is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, along with the tiger, lion, jaguar, and snow leopard.\n\nLeopards are known for their distinctive spotted coat patterns, which serve as camouflage in their natural habitats. They are solitary and territorial animals, and are considered to be excellent climbers and swimmers. Leopards are primarily nocturnal and are opportunistic hunters, preying on a wide range of animals, including small to medium-sized mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n\nThese animals are characterized by their powerful build, muscular limbs, and sharp claws and teeth, which they use to subdue their prey. Leopards are also known for their adaptability, as they can thrive in a variety of environments, from dense forests and savannas to mountainous regions and even urban areas.\n\nDue to various threats, such as habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, the leopard's population has declined in many parts of its range. As a result, the species is classified as \"Vulnerable\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.",
