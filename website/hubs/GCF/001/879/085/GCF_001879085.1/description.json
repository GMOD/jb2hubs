  "description": "Nicotiana attenuata, commonly known as coyote tobacco or desert tobacco, is a species of wild tobacco native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 30-120 cm.\n\nNicotiana attenuata is known for its distinctive, narrow, and elongated leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. The leaves are characterized by their bright green color and hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink or purple.\n\nThis species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native habitat, which includes deserts, chaparrals, and dry washes. It has developed mechanisms to cope with environmental stresses, such as drought and herbivory, including the production of defensive compounds and the ability to respond to various environmental cues.\n\nNicotiana attenuata is an important component of the local ecosystem, serving as a food source for various insects and small animals. It has also been used by indigenous communities for medicinal and cultural purposes, though its use requires caution due to the presence of nicotine and other potentially toxic compounds.",
