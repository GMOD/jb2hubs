  "description": "Penicilliopsis zonata CBS 506.65 is a species of ascomycete fungus that belongs to the genus Penicilliopsis. It was isolated and deposited in the CBS-KNAW Culture Collection (CBS 506.65).\n\nPenicilliopsis zonata is a filamentous, haploid fungus that reproduces asexually through the production of conidiospores. The conidiophores (asexual spore-bearing structures) of this species exhibit a characteristic zonate or banded pattern, which is the basis for its specific epithet \"zonata\".\n\nMorphologically, the colonies of P. zonata CBS 506.65 grow on various media, forming a dense, velvety texture with a distinctive concentric zonal pattern. The conidiophores are typically branched and produce chains of smooth-walled, ellipsoidal to globose conidia.\n\nGenetically, the taxonomic placement of this fungal strain within the Penicilliopsis genus has been confirmed through molecular analysis, such as DNA sequencing of conserved genomic regions.\n\nThis strain of P. zonata has been the subject of various studies, as it may possess interesting biotechnological or ecological characteristics that warrant further investigation.",
