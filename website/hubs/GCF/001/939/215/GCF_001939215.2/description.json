  "description": "Indian encephalitis associated cyclovirus (IECV) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Cycloviridae family. This virus has been detected in patients with suspected viral encephalitis in India, and it is believed to be associated with some cases of encephalitis in the region.\n\nThe genome of IECV is circular and approximately 2 kilobases in size. The virus possesses two major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode a replication-associated protein and a capsid protein, which are characteristic features of the Cycloviridae family.\n\nIECV is thought to be transmitted through contact with contaminated environmental sources or potentially through insect vectors, such as mosquitoes. However, the exact mode of transmission and the natural reservoir of the virus are not yet fully understood.\n\nThe role of IECV in causing encephalitis is still under investigation, as it has been detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance and pathogenic mechanisms of this emerging virus in the context of Indian encephalitis cases.",
