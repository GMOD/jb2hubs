  "description": "Borreliella mayonii is a species of spiral-shaped bacteria (spirochete) that belongs to the Borreliaceae family. It was first identified in 2013 and is named after Dr. Robert Mayonii, who contributed to the discovery and characterization of this new Lyme disease-causing agent.\n\nBorreliella mayonii is a tick-borne pathogen that can cause Lyme disease in humans. It is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in the upper Midwestern United States. Compared to the more common Borreliella burgdorferi, the causative agent of the majority of Lyme disease cases, B. mayonii exhibits some distinct clinical features, such as a higher frequency of neurological symptoms and atypical rash patterns.\n\nGenetically, B. mayonii is closely related to B. burgdorferi but can be distinguished by its unique genetic markers and distinct phylogenetic placement within the Borreliella genus. Ongoing research continues to elucidate the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations associated with this recently discovered Lyme disease-causing spirochete.",
