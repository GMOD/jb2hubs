  "description": "Companilactobacillus crustorum is a species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that belongs to the genus Companilactobacillus. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nCompanilactobacillus crustorum was isolated from the surface of traditional Croatian cheeses, particularly from the cheese rind. It is known to be involved in the ripening and flavor development of certain artisanal cheeses.\n\nThe cells of Companilactobacillus crustorum are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. The bacterium is catalase-negative and produces lactic acid as the primary end-product of carbohydrate fermentation.\n\nCompanilactobacillus crustorum is considered a beneficial bacterium in cheese production, as it contributes to the development of desired sensory characteristics, such as aroma and texture, in traditional cheese varieties. Its presence and activity are often associated with the unique flavors and characteristics of traditional, artisanal cheese products.",
