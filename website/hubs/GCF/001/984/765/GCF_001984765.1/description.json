  "description": "Castor canadensis, commonly known as the North American beaver, is a large semiaquatic rodent native to North America. It is the largest living rodent in North America and one of the largest rodents in the world.\n\nThe North American beaver is a highly specialized aquatic mammal that is well-adapted to its environment. It has a large, stocky body, short legs, and a broad, flat tail that serves as a rudder and a tool for building dams and lodges. Its dense, waterproof fur and webbed hind feet make it an excellent swimmer.\n\nBeavers are known for their remarkable engineering abilities, as they build complex dams and lodges using tree branches, logs, and mud. These structures create ponds and provide the beavers with a secure habitat and a reliable food source, as they primarily feed on the bark, twigs, and leaves of trees and aquatic plants.\n\nCastor canadensis plays a vital role in the ecosystems it inhabits, as its dam-building activities create wetland habitats that support a diverse array of plant and animal species. The species is considered a keystone species, as its presence and activities have a significant impact on the overall structure and function of the ecosystem.",
