  "description": "Orbicella faveolata, commonly known as the mountainous star coral or the lobed star coral, is a species of reef-building coral found in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a member of the family Meandrinidae and the order Scleractinia.\n\nOrbicella faveolata is a massive, boulder-shaped coral that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter. Its surface is characterized by a series of shallow, meandering valleys and ridges, giving it a distinctive \"honeycomb\" or \"brain-like\" appearance. The coral's polyps are typically small, with a diameter of around 3-5 millimeters, and they are arranged in a radial pattern within the valleys.\n\nThis species is an important contributor to the overall structure and biodiversity of Caribbean reef ecosystems, providing habitat and shelter for a wide variety of marine organisms. Orbicella faveolata is considered a key reef-building species and plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of coral reefs in the region.\n\nUnfortunately, Orbicella faveolata is currently listed as a threatened species under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, primarily due to the impacts of climate change, disease, and other anthropogenic stressors on coral reef ecosystems worldwide.",
