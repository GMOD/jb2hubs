  "description": "Trypanosoma theileri is a species of parasitic protozoan that primarily infects cattle and other bovine animals. It belongs to the genus Trypanosoma, which includes various species of unicellular flagellated parasites that cause diseases in both humans and animals.\n\nT. theileri is commonly known as the \"cattle trypanosome\" or \"Theileria parasite,\" named after the German veterinarian Theiler, who first identified it in 1902. It is a large trypanosome, measuring approximately 30-50 micrometers in length, and is typically found in the bloodstream of infected animals.\n\nThe life cycle of T. theileri involves both vertebrate (cattle) and invertebrate (ticks) hosts. The parasite is transmitted between hosts by certain species of ticks, such as Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma ticks. Once inside the bovine host, T. theileri multiplies and can be found in the blood, lymph, and other tissues.\n\nInfection with T. theileri is generally considered non-pathogenic or of low pathogenicity in cattle, as it rarely causes clinical disease. However, in some cases, it may contribute to anemia or other health issues, particularly in young or immunocompromised animals. The impact of T. theileri on the overall health and productivity of cattle herds is an area of ongoing research and monitoring.",
