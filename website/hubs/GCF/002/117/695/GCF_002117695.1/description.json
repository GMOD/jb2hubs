  "description": "Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV) is a member of the Nairovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that primarily affects sheep and goats.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted by Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma ticks, which serve as the natural reservoir. NSDV is endemic in parts of Africa, particularly eastern and central regions, as well as the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nInfection with NSDV can cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in sheep and goats, characterized by high fever, depression, anorexia, diarrhea, and bleeding from various body orifices. The virus can also cause abortion in pregnant animals.\n\nNSDV is considered a zoonotic pathogen, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. Human infections are rare but can result in a similar hemorrhagic fever syndrome, with symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal manifestations.\n\nDiagnosis of NSDV infection typically involves molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serological assays. Treatment for infected animals and humans is primarily supportive, as there are no specific antiviral therapies available.\n\nPreventive measures include tick control, proper handling of infected animals, and the use of personal protective equipment for individuals working with the virus or its vectors.",
