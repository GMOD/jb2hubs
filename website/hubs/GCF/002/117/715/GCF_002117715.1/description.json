  "description": "Orthohantavirus montanoense is a species of hantavirus that is primarily found in North America. It is a member of the Orthohantavirus genus, which is a group of zoonotic viruses that are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents, their urine, feces, or saliva.\n\nOrthohantavirus montanoense is primarily associated with the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) as its natural reservoir host. The virus can cause a severe form of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HFRS) in humans, which is characterized by fever, muscle aches, fatigue, dizziness, chills, and, in some cases, may progress to lung and kidney complications.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the inhalation of aerosolized virus particles from infected rodent excreta. Exposure can also occur through direct contact with infected rodents or their nests. Preventive measures, such as proper rodent control and personal protective equipment, are essential to reduce the risk of infection.",
