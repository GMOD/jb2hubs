  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called the \"Madrid virus.\" This appears to be a fictitious name, as I could not find any credible scientific information about a virus by this name. Viruses are typically named based on their origin, the disease they cause, or other identifying characteristics. Without more context, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description for this particular \"virus.\" If you have additional details about the purported properties or origins of this virus, I'd be happy to try and research it further. However, based on the information provided, there does not seem to be an actual scientific entity known as the \"Madrid virus.\"",
