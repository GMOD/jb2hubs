  "description": "Guaroa virus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is primarily transmitted by Culex mosquitoes and has been isolated from various vertebrate hosts, including humans, in parts of South America, particularly in the Amazon region.\n\nThe Guaroa virus genome consists of three RNA segments: large (L), medium (M), and small (S). The L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, while the M segment encodes the viral glycoproteins responsible for host cell attachment and entry. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein, which is essential for viral replication and assembly.\n\nInfection with Guaroa virus can lead to mild to severe febrile illness in humans, with symptoms ranging from headache, myalgia, and fatigue to more severe complications, such as neurological manifestations. However, the exact clinical spectrum and disease severity associated with Guaroa virus infection are not yet fully understood, and more research is needed to elucidate the virus's epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential public health impact.",
