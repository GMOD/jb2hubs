  "description": "Orthohantavirus caobangense is a species of hantavirus that was first identified in Vietnam. Hantaviruses are a group of viruses that primarily infect rodents and can be transmitted to humans, causing a range of diseases known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPPS) or hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).\n\nOrthohantavirus caobangense is a member of the Orthohantavirus genus, which is part of the Hantaviridae family. The virus was isolated from the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) in the Cao Bang province of Vietnam, hence the name \"caobangense.\"\n\nGenetically, Orthohantavirus caobangense is closely related to other hantaviruses found in Asia, such as Hantaan virus and Seoul virus, which are known to cause HFRS in humans. However, the specific disease characteristics and transmission dynamics of Orthohantavirus caobangense are still under investigation, as more research is needed to fully understand its public health implications.",
