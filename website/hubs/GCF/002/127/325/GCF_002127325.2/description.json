  "description": "Helianthus annuus, commonly known as the common sunflower, is an annual plant species that belongs to the genus Helianthus, which is part of the Asteraceae family. It is a large, tall, and robust plant that can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in height, with a characteristic large, solitary flower head composed of numerous small flowers.\n\nThe sunflower's leaves are broad, rough, and coarsely toothed, typically arranged in an alternate pattern along the stem. The large, circular flower head consists of two types of flowers: the showy yellow ray florets around the perimeter and the smaller, disc florets in the center. These flowers produce a large number of edible seeds, which are a valuable source of oil and protein.\n\nHelianthus annuus is native to North America and is widely cultivated for its seeds, oil, and ornamental value. It is a fast-growing, sun-loving plant that thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and requires moderate to high levels of sunlight exposure. The sunflower is a popular and iconic symbol of summer and is often used in decorative and landscape applications.",
