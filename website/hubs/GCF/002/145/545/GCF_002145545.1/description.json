  "description": "Orthohantavirus delgaditoense is a species of hantavirus, a group of zoonotic viruses primarily transmitted through exposure to infected rodents. This virus was first identified in the Delgadito region of Argentina, where it is believed to be harbored by the small rodent species Oligoryzomys delicatus.\n\nOrthohantavirus delgaditoense belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the Hantaviridae family. Like other hantaviruses, it is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. The virus primarily infects the lungs and kidneys of its rodent host, and can be transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosolized virus particles from rodent urine, feces, or saliva.\n\nInfection with Orthohantavirus delgaditoense in humans can lead to a condition known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HFRS), which is characterized by fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, and potentially life-threatening respiratory distress. The severity of the disease can vary, and effective treatment and prevention measures are an important focus of research and public health efforts in regions where this virus is known to circulate.",
