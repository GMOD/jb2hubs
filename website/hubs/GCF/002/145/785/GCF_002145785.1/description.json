  "description": "The Anjozorobe virus is a newly discovered virus that was first isolated from a species of shrew (Suncus murinus) in the Anjozorobe region of Madagascar in 2018. It belongs to the family Hantaviridae, which is a group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses primarily carried by small rodents and insectivores.\n\nThe Anjozorobe virus is a novel hantavirus that has not been extensively studied yet. Initial genetic analysis has shown that it is distinct from other known hantaviruses, suggesting it may represent a new species or lineage within the Hantaviridae family. \n\nThe natural reservoir host and potential modes of transmission for the Anjozorobe virus are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and possible public health implications, if any. As a newly discovered virus, the Anjozorobe virus highlights the importance of continued surveillance and study of zoonotic viruses, especially in biodiversity hotspots like Madagascar.",
