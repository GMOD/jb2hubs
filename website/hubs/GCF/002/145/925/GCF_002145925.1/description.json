  "description": "Orthohantavirus sangassouense is a species of hantavirus that is primarily found in Central Africa. It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans.\n\nOrthohantavirus sangassouense belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is a group of RNA viruses in the family Hantaviridae. The virus is primarily carried by rodents, specifically the African wood mouse (Hylomyscus spp.), and can be transmitted to humans through exposure to the urine, feces, or saliva of infected rodents.\n\nThe virus can cause a severe form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, characterized by fever, headache, back and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in some cases, bleeding and kidney dysfunction. The case fatality rate for Orthohantavirus sangassouense infections can be relatively high, though the exact rate is not well-established due to the limited number of reported cases.\n\nDiagnosis of Orthohantavirus sangassouense infection typically involves serological tests to detect the presence of specific antibodies in the patient's blood. Treatment is mainly supportive, focusing on managing the symptoms and complications of the disease.\n\nPrevention of Orthohantavirus sangassouense infection involves reducing contact with rodents and their habitats, as well as practicing good hygiene and safety measures when handling potentially infected materials.",
