  "description": "Orthohantavirus khabarovskense is a species of hantavirus that belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus, a group of rodent-borne viruses within the Hantaviridae family. This virus was first identified in the Khabarovsk region of Russia, hence its name.\n\nOrthohantavirus khabarovskense is primarily carried by the Korean field mouse (Apodemus peninsulae) and is known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPPS) in humans. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodent urine, feces, or saliva, or by inhaling aerosolized particles containing the virus.\n\nThe genome of Orthohantavirus khabarovskense consists of three single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments, designated as the S (small), M (medium), and L (large) segments. These segments encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the two surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), respectively.\n\nOrthohantavirus khabarovskense is considered a significant public health concern in regions where it is present, as it can cause severe respiratory illness in humans. Ongoing research aims to further understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential prevention and treatment strategies for this virus.",
