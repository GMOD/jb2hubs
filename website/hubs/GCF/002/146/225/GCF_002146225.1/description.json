  "description": "Imjin virus is a newly discovered virus that belongs to the genus Orthohantavirus, which is part of the family Hantaviridae. Hantaviruses are primarily transmitted to humans through exposure to infected rodents or their excreta.\n\nThe Imjin virus was first isolated from the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius) in South Korea in 2017. It is closely related to other Hantaviruses found in Asia, such as the Hantaan virus, which is known to cause Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) in humans.\n\nPreliminary studies have suggested that the Imjin virus may also be capable of causing HFRS in humans, though more research is needed to fully understand its pathogenicity and transmission dynamics. The virus has been detected in small rodent populations in certain regions of South Korea, but its geographic distribution and potential for zoonotic transmission remain active areas of investigation by public health authorities and scientific researchers.",
