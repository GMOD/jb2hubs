  "description": "Triticum dicoccoides, also known as wild emmer wheat, is a wild progenitor species of cultivated wheat. It is a tetraploid wheat species, with a chromosome count of 2n = 4x = 28.\n\nTriticum dicoccoides is native to the Fertile Crescent region, specifically in parts of the Middle East, including Israel, Syria, Turkey, and Iran. It is considered the progenitor of domesticated emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccum) and is believed to have been one of the earliest wheat species to be domesticated by early human civilizations.\n\nThe plant is an annual, self-pollinating grass that can grow up to 1 meter in height. It has slender, jointed stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence is a dense, spike-like structure that bears spikelets with two fertile florets each. The grains or kernels are enclosed within a tough, hulled structure known as a glume, which sets it apart from the free-threshing wheats.\n\nTriticum dicoccoides is considered an important genetic resource for wheat improvement, as it possesses a range of desirable traits, such as resistance to various diseases and abiotic stresses, as well as diverse genetic variation that can be utilized in breeding programs to enhance the traits of cultivated wheat species.",
