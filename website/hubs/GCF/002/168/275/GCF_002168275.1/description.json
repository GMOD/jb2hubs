  "description": "Herrania umbratica is a species of tree belonging to the genus Herrania, which is part of the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical rainforests in South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador.\n\nH. umbratica is a small to medium-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 10-20 meters. The tree has a straight, slender trunk and a dense, spreading canopy. The leaves are large, deeply lobed, and palmate in shape, characteristic of the Herrania genus. The flowers are small, inconspicuous, and produced in clusters.\n\nThe fruits of H. umbratica are pod-like capsules that contain numerous small, edible seeds. These seeds are a valuable food source for various wildlife species in the rainforest ecosystem. The tree's ability to thrive in the shaded understory of dense forests makes it an important component of the forest's biodiversity and ecosystem.\n\nH. umbratica is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation and land-use changes in its native range. Conservation efforts are important to ensure the survival of this ecologically significant tree species.",
