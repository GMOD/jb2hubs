  "description": "Neomonachus schauinslandi, commonly known as the Hawaiian monk seal, is a species of earless seal that is endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. It is one of the rarest marine mammals in the world, with a current population estimated to be around 1,400 individuals.\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is a medium-sized seal, with adult males typically weighing between 400 and 600 pounds (180 to 270 kg) and females weighing between 300 and 500 pounds (135 to 225 kg). They have a robust, fusiform body shape with a rounded head, small eyes, and a short snout. Their fur is gray to brown in color, and they have a distinctive dark-colored muzzle.\n\nThese seals are primarily found in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where they haul out on sandy beaches, rocky shorelines, and coral atolls to rest, molt, and give birth. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks found in the surrounding waters.\n\nThe Hawaiian monk seal is classified as an endangered species, with the primary threats to their survival being entanglement in fishing gear, habitat loss, and interactions with humans. Conservation efforts, including monitoring, research, and habitat protection, are ongoing to help preserve this unique and vulnerable species.",
