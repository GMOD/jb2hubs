  "description": "I apologize, but I do not have any information about a specific virus called \"Human fecal virus Jorvi4\". Viruses found in human feces can be diverse, and many are still being discovered and characterized by scientists. Without more details about the source, characteristics, or context of this particular virus, I cannot provide a reliable scientific description. I would need access to published research or data from scientific studies to accurately describe an unfamiliar viral species. My knowledge is limited, and I do not want to speculate or make claims about a virus I cannot confidently identify or verify. I'm afraid I cannot give you a satisfactory scientific description in this case.",
