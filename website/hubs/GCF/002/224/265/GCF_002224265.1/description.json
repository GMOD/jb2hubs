  "description": "Vibrio vulnificus NBRC 15645 = ATCC 27562 is a Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Vibrio genus. It is a halophilic, facultatively anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen, and it requires sodium ions (Na+) for optimal growth.\n\nVibrio vulnificus is considered an opportunistic pathogen, as it can cause severe infections in individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions, such as liver disease, diabetes, or hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder). The bacterium can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including primary septicemia, wound infections, and gastroenteritis, particularly in individuals who consume raw or undercooked seafood.\n\nThe NBRC 15645 and ATCC 27562 designations refer to the specific strains of Vibrio vulnificus that have been isolated and maintained in the Biological Resource Center of the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation (NBRC) in Japan and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in the United States, respectively. These strains are commonly used in research and diagnostic applications to study the biology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Vibrio vulnificus.",
