  "description": "Teleopsis dalmanni is a species of stalk-eyed fly belonging to the family Diopsidae. These flies are known for their distinctive, elongated eye stalks that protrude from the sides of their heads.\n\nThe most notable feature of T. dalmanni is the extreme sexual dimorphism in the length of the eye stalks. Males typically have much longer eye stalks compared to females, which is thought to be a result of sexual selection. The length of the eye stalks in males is believed to be an indicator of their fitness and social status within the population.\n\nThese flies are found in tropical forests in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Thailand. They are known to engage in complex courtship behaviors, with males using their elongated eye stalks to attract mates and establish dominance hierarchies within the population.\n\nTeleopsis dalmanni is an important model organism in the study of sexual selection, evolutionary biology, and the mechanisms underlying the development of extreme sexual dimorphism in morphological traits.",
