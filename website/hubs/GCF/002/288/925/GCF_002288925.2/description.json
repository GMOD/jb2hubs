  "description": "Delphinapterus leucas, commonly known as the beluga whale or white whale, is a species of whale that belongs to the family Monodontidae. Beluga whales are found in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, primarily in the waters of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThese whales are characterized by their distinctive white or off-white coloration, which helps them blend in with the ice and snow of their natural habitat. They have a rounded, melon-shaped head and a small, inconspicuous dorsal fin. Beluga whales are known for their ability to move their heads from side to side, a unique trait among cetaceans.\n\nBeluga whales are social animals and often form small pods or groups. They are primarily carnivorous, feeding on a variety of prey, including fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. These whales are capable of diving to depths of up to 700 meters, and they are known for their ability to communicate using a wide range of vocalizations, including whistles, clicks, and chirps.\n\nBeluga whales are considered a vulnerable species due to various threats, including hunting, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique and charismatic marine mammal.",
