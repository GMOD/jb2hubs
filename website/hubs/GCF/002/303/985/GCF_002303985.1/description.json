  "description": "Durio zibethinus, commonly known as the durian, is a species of tree in the Malvaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The durian is known for its large, spiky fruit that can weigh up to 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds).\n\nThe tree can grow up to 50 meters (164 feet) tall and has a thick, rough bark. The leaves are oblong in shape and can reach up to 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length. The flowers are small, yellow, and grow in clusters.\n\nThe fruit of the durian is the most distinctive feature of the species. It has a thick, thorny husk that surrounds the edible flesh. The flesh is creamy and custard-like, with a strong, pungent odor that is often described as a combination of sweet and savory flavors. The durian contains several large seeds that are also edible when cooked.\n\nDurio zibethinus is a popular fruit in Southeast Asia and is highly prized for its unique flavor and texture. However, the strong odor of the fruit can be off-putting to some people, and the fruit is banned from many public places and transportation methods in the region.",
