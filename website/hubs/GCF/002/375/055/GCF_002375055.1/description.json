  "description": "Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to provide a detailed scientific description of the species Hudisavirus sp. This appears to be a novel or lesser-known virus, and without access to specific scientific data and publications about its characteristics, I cannot give a comprehensive account of its biology, taxonomy, or other relevant details.\n\nIn general, when describing a species scientifically, key information that would be included in a short description may cover aspects such as:\n\n1. Taxonomy: The classification of the organism, including its domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species.\n\n2. Morphology: The physical structure and appearance of the organism, including size, shape, symmetry, and distinguishing features.\n\n3. Genome: The genetic makeup of the organism, including the type and structure of its genetic material (e.g., DNA, RNA).\n\n4. Replication: The mechanisms by which the organism reproduces and propagates.\n\n5. Habitat and distribution: The natural environments and geographic regions where the organism is found.\n\n6. Ecological role: The function and impact of the organism within its ecosystem.\n\nWithout access to the specific scientific literature on this particular virus species, I cannot provide a more detailed account. Further research would be needed to gather the relevant information required for a comprehensive scientific description.",
