  "description": "Olea europaea var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild olive or European olive, is a subspecies of the common olive tree (Olea europaea). It is a small, evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean region, including countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and North Africa.\n\nThe wild olive tree is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and grayish-green on the underside. The leaves are leathery in texture and have a distinct silvery sheen. The flowers are small and white, and the fruits, or olives, are smaller and more elongated compared to those of the cultivated olive varieties.\n\nOlea europaea var. sylvestris is considered to be the progenitor of the domesticated olive tree (Olea europaea var. europaea), which has been cultivated for centuries for its edible fruits and valuable oil. The wild olive is known to be more drought-tolerant and resistant to pests and diseases than its cultivated counterpart.\n\nThis subspecies plays an important role in the natural ecosystems of the Mediterranean region, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. It is also valued for its ornamental and landscaping purposes, often being used in gardens and public spaces.",
