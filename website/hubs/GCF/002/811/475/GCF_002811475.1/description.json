  "description": "Leptospira hartskeerlii is a species of spirochete bacteria that belongs to the genus Leptospira. This species was first isolated and identified in the Netherlands in 2017.\n\nLeptospira hartskeerlii is a small, spiral-shaped, motile bacterium that is responsible for causing leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that can infect both humans and animals. The bacterium is primarily transmitted through contact with contaminated water, soil, or the urine of infected animals, such as rodents, livestock, and wildlife.\n\nLeptospira hartskeerlii is considered a pathogenic species within the Leptospira genus, as it can potentially cause a range of clinical manifestations in infected individuals, including fever, headache, muscle pain, and in severe cases, kidney and liver damage.\n\nThe identification and characterization of Leptospira hartskeerlii have contributed to a better understanding of the diversity and epidemiology of leptospirosis, which remains a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.",
