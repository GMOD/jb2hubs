It is a member of the Carangidae family, which includes jacks and pompanos.\n\nThe Yellowtail Amberjack is a large, streamlined fish with a fusiform body shape. It has a distinctive bright yellow tail and dorsal fin, with a dark blue-green back and silvery-white sides. The fish can grow up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in length and can weigh up to 45 kilograms (100 pounds).\n\nThis subspecies is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from southern California to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. It is a pelagic species, meaning it lives in the open ocean and near the surface of the water, and is known to form large schools.\n\nThe Yellowtail Amberjack is an important commercial and recreational fish, prized for its firm, high-quality flesh and delicate flavor. It is commonly caught using hook-and-line, trolling, and other fishing methods. The species is also cultivated in aquaculture operations, particularly in Japan and other parts of Asia.",
