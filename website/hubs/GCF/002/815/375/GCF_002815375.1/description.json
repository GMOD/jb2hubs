  "description": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the Pneumoviridae family and the genus Metapneumovirus. It was first identified in 2001 and is considered one of the leading causes of acute respiratory tract infections, particularly in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe hMPV genome encodes for several structural and non-structural proteins, including the fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins, which are important for viral entry and attachment to host cells. The virus primarily infects the upper and lower respiratory tract, causing symptoms ranging from mild cold-like illness to more severe conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\n\nTransmission of hMPV occurs primarily through respiratory droplets and close contact with infected individuals. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces. Infection with hMPV can occur throughout the year, but it is more prevalent during the colder months, similar to the seasonality of other respiratory viruses.\n\nDiagnosis of hMPV infection is typically done through molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can detect the presence of the virus in respiratory samples. Treatment for hMPV infection is mainly supportive, with management of symptoms and maintaining hydration and respiratory function. Effective vaccines or specific antiviral therapies for hMPV are currently under development.",
