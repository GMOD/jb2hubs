  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no such species as \"Tibrovirus congo\" that I could find in any scientific literature or databases. This appears to be a made-up or hypothetical organism name.\n\nWithout a real, existing species to reference, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Scientific descriptions typically involve details about the organism's taxonomy, morphology, physiology, ecology, and other verifiable characteristics based on observation and research. \n\nIf you have a real organism in mind that you would like me to describe, please provide the correct scientific name, and I would be happy to research and summarize the key details about that species to the best of my knowledge. Otherwise, I cannot generate a credible scientific description for a fictional or non-existent species.",
