  "description": "Betacoronavirus England 1 is a species of coronavirus that was first identified in England in 2020. It is a member of the Betacoronavirus genus, which includes several other well-known human and animal coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nBetacoronavirus England 1 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Its genome is approximately 30 kilobases in length and encodes a variety of structural and non-structural proteins essential for its replication and function.\n\nThis coronavirus is believed to have zoonotic origins, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. Its exact animal reservoir is not yet fully understood, but it is closely related to other betacoronaviruses found in bats and other wildlife.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that Betacoronavirus England 1 can infect human cells and cause respiratory illness in humans, though the severity of the disease it causes and its overall public health impact are still under investigation. Ongoing research aims to better understand the biology, transmission dynamics, and potential clinical implications of this newly discovered coronavirus.",
