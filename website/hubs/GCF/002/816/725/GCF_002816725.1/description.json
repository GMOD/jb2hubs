  "description": "Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. EV-D68 was first isolated in 1962 from a child with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in the United States.\n\nEV-D68 is known to cause respiratory illnesses, including mild to severe symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose, body aches, and difficulty breathing. In some cases, it can lead to more severe complications, such as pneumonia and acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a rare neurological condition that can cause paralysis.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and close personal contact. EV-D68 can also be found in the stool of infected individuals, but the fecal-oral route of transmission is less common.\n\nDiagnosis of EV-D68 infection typically involves molecular testing, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, to detect the presence of the virus in respiratory specimens. Treatment for EV-D68 is supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and providing respiratory support as needed.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance efforts are crucial to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential preventive measures for EV-D68 infections, as the virus continues to pose a public health concern, particularly for vulnerable populations, such as children and individuals with underlying medical conditions.",
