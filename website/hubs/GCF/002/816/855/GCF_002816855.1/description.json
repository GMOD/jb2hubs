  "description": "Rhinovirus B3 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the upper respiratory tract in humans, causing the common cold.\n\nRhinovirus B3 has an icosahedral capsid structure, approximately 30 nanometers in diameter, composed of four viral structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4). The viral genome is approximately 7,200 nucleotides in length and encodes for a polyprotein that is processed into various functional proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly.\n\nRhinovirus B3 enters host cells by binding to specific cellular receptors, such as the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and utilizes the host's cellular machinery to replicate its genome and produce new viral particles. The virus can cause mild to moderate respiratory symptoms, including nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat, and cough, which typically resolve within 7-10 days in healthy individuals.\n\nRhinovirus B3 is one of the many strains of rhinoviruses that contribute to the common cold, a highly prevalent viral infection worldwide. Understanding the molecular characteristics and host-virus interactions of Rhinovirus B3 can aid in the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for the common cold.",
