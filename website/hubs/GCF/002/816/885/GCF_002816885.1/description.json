  "description": "Human rhinovirus NAT001 is a member of the Enterovirus genus within the Picornaviridae family. It is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the upper respiratory tract in humans, causing the common cold.\n\nThe viral genome is approximately 7.2 kilobases in length and encodes a single polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into various structural and non-structural proteins necessary for viral replication and assembly. The viral capsid is composed of four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) that provide the protective shell for the viral genome.\n\nHuman rhinovirus NAT001 is one of the more than 100 known serotypes of human rhinoviruses, which are the most common causative agents of the common cold. Infection with this virus typically results in mild upper respiratory symptoms, such as nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat, and cough, lasting for about 7-10 days. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with contaminated surfaces or airborne droplets, and it can also spread through close interpersonal contact.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of human rhinovirus NAT001 is important for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies against the common cold, which is a significant public health concern due to its high prevalence and impact on individual and societal well-being.",
