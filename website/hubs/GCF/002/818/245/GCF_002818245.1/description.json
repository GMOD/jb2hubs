  "description": "Torque teno virus 9 (TTV9) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus belonging to the genus Betatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. It has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 3.2 kilobases in length.\n\nTTV9 is considered a human commensal virus, meaning it is commonly found in the human population, often without causing any apparent symptoms or clinical disease. The virus is believed to be widely distributed globally, with high prevalence rates reported in various human populations.\n\nThe exact role and clinical significance of TTV9 in human health are still under investigation. While some studies have suggested potential associations between TTV9 infection and certain disease conditions, the causal relationship remains unclear. Further research is needed to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential clinical implications of TTV9 infection.",
