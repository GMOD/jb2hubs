  "description": "Torque teno virus 13 (TTV13) is a member of the Anelloviridae family, a group of small, single-stranded, circular DNA viruses. TTV13 is classified as a species within the Alphatorquevirus genus of the Anelloviridae family.\n\nTTV13 is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it lacks an outer lipid membrane. Its genome consists of a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 3.8 kilobases in length. The viral genome encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of various viral proteins, including the viral capsid proteins.\n\nThe Torque teno viruses, including TTV13, are widely distributed in the human population and are commonly found in the blood and various tissues of healthy individuals. However, their exact role and potential pathogenic associations are still under investigation. Some studies have suggested potential links between TTV infection and certain human diseases, but the causal relationships are not yet fully established.\n\nTTV13, like other Torque teno viruses, is believed to have a high prevalence in the human population, with infection rates ranging from 50% to 100% in different geographic regions and populations. The virus is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, but other modes of transmission, such as blood-borne and vertical transmission, have also been reported.\n\nOverall, the Torque teno virus 13 is a member of a diverse group of viruses that are commonly found in humans, but their precise clinical significance and potential impacts on human health continue to be an active area of research.",
