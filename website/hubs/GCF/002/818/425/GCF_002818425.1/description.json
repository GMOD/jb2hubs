  "description": "Torque teno virus 29 (TTV29) is a species of small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. It is classified within the Iotatorquevirus genus, which includes various Torque teno virus (TTV) species.\n\nTTV29 is a non-enveloped virus with a genome size of approximately 3.2 to 3.4 kilobases. The viral genome encodes multiple proteins, including the viral capsid protein and regulatory proteins involved in viral replication and gene expression.\n\nTTV29 is widely distributed in the human population, with a high prevalence detected in various geographic regions. It is commonly found in the blood, respiratory tract, and other human tissues, suggesting a potential for systemic or localized infection.\n\nThe exact pathogenic role of TTV29 in human health is not yet fully understood. While some studies have associated certain TTV species with various clinical conditions, the relationship between TTV29 and specific diseases remains an area of ongoing research and investigation.\n\nOverall, TTV29 is a member of the diverse Anelloviridae family, and its biological properties and potential interactions with the human host continue to be the subject of scientific exploration.",
