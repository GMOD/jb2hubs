  "description": "The Torque teno mini virus 11 (TTMnV11) is a member of the Anelloviridae family, a group of small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. TTMnV11 is classified as a member of the genus Betatorquevirus, which includes numerous species of Torque teno mini viruses.\n\nTTMnV11 is a non-enveloped virus with a genome size of approximately 2.9 kilobases. The viral genome encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that are believed to encode for viral proteins involved in replication, transcription, and structural functions.\n\nThe Torque teno mini viruses, including TTMnV11, are known to be ubiquitous in human and animal populations, often found as persistent, asymptomatic infections. The exact role and potential pathogenic effects of TTMnV11 in human or animal health are not yet fully understood, as research on this specific virus species is limited.\n\nFurther studies are needed to elucidate the epidemiology, host range, and potential clinical significance of Torque teno mini virus 11 and other related anelloviruses in various host species.",
