  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 3 (TTMDV3) is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that belongs to the genus Betatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. The virus has a circular, single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 3.2 kilobases in length.\n\nTTMDV3 is a member of the Torque teno midi virus species, which are known to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. The virus is believed to be ubiquitous in the human population, with high prevalence rates detected in various clinical samples, such as blood, respiratory secretions, and fecal samples.\n\nThe exact pathogenic role of TTMDV3 in human health is not yet fully understood. Some studies have suggested potential associations between TTMDV3 infection and various clinical conditions, but the causal relationship remains unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential role of this virus in human health and disease.",
