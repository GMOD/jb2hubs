  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 7 (TTMDV7) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the genus Betatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. The virus has a circular genome and is approximately 3.2 kilobases in size.\n\nTTMDV7 is considered a member of the Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) species, which are a group of viruses that have been detected in various human and animal samples. These viruses are known to be widespread in the human population, with high prevalence rates reported in both healthy individuals and patients with various medical conditions.\n\nThe exact role and clinical significance of TTMDV7 in human health and disease are not yet fully understood. Like other anelloviruses, TTMDV7 is believed to be a persistent, latent infection in the host, with no clear association with specific disease states. Ongoing research aims to elucidate the potential interactions between TTMDV7 and the human immune system, as well as its potential involvement in various pathological conditions.",
