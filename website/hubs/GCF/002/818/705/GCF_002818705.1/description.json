  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 11 (TTMV-11) is a member of the Anelloviridae family, a group of small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. TTMV-11 is classified as a midi virus, which refers to its genome size, typically ranging from 3.2 to 3.9 kilobases.\n\nThese viruses are known to infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, and are commonly found in the blood and other tissues of their hosts. The Torque teno midi virus 11 specifically has been detected in human samples, although its exact prevalence and clinical significance are not yet fully understood.\n\nLike other members of the Anelloviridae family, TTMV-11 is believed to have a ubiquitous distribution and is thought to establish persistent, lifelong infections in its hosts. The virus may play a role in modulating the host's immune system, but its precise biological functions and potential implications for human health are still under investigation by the scientific community.\n\nFurther research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, molecular characteristics, and potential clinical relevance of the Torque teno midi virus 11 and other members of the Anelloviridae family.",
