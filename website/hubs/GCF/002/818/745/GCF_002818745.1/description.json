  "description": "Torque teno midi virus 13 (TTMDV-13) is a member of the Anelloviridae family, a group of small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. TTMDV-13 is classified as a midi virus, a subgroup of the Torque teno virus (TTV) genus, based on its genomic size and structure.\n\nThe TTMDV-13 genome is approximately 3.2 kilobases in length and contains three open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for putative viral proteins. The exact function of these proteins is not fully understood, but they are believed to be involved in viral replication and possibly in modulating host immune responses.\n\nTTMDV-13 is widely distributed in the human population and has been detected in various human tissues and body fluids, including blood, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. However, the exact mode of transmission and the potential clinical significance of TTMDV-13 infection remain unclear, as it is often found in healthy individuals and its role in disease pathogenesis is not well-established.\n\nOngoing research continues to investigate the epidemiology, genetic diversity, and potential clinical implications of TTMDV-13 and other members of the Anelloviridae family, with the aim of better understanding their biological properties and potential impact on human health.",
