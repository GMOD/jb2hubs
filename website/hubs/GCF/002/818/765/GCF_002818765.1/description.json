  "description": "The Torque teno midi virus 14 (TTMV14) is a small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. Anelloviruses are a group of widely distributed viruses that infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans.\n\nTTMV14 is classified as a member of the Betatorquevirus genus within the Anelloviridae family. These viruses are known to have a very high genetic diversity, with a wide range of host species and tissue tropisms.\n\nThe genome of TTMV14 is approximately 3.2 kilobases in length and encodes for several open reading frames (ORFs) that are involved in viral replication, transcription, and possibly host interactions. The precise mechanisms of TTMV14 infection, replication, and pathogenesis are not yet fully understood, as the majority of anelloviruses are thought to be generally apathogenic in their hosts.\n\nEpidemiological studies have detected the presence of TTMV14 in various human populations, suggesting a widespread distribution of this virus. However, its clinical significance and potential implications for human health remain an area of ongoing research and investigation within the scientific community.",
