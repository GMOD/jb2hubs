  "description": "The Human stool-associated circular virus NG13 (HSCV-NG13) is a recently discovered virus that has been found in human stool samples. It belongs to the family Circoviridae, which are small, non-enveloped viruses with circular, single-stranded DNA genomes.\n\nHSCV-NG13 was first identified through metagenomic analysis of stool samples collected from healthy individuals. The viral genome of HSCV-NG13 is approximately 2.1 kilobases in size and contains two major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode proteins involved in viral replication and structural functions.\n\nThe presence of HSCV-NG13 in human stool samples suggests that it may be a member of the human gut virome, the diverse community of viruses that reside in the human gastrointestinal tract. However, the exact role and potential impacts of HSCV-NG13 on human health are currently unknown, as its biological properties and interactions with the host are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the prevalence, host range, and potential pathogenic or commensal relationships of HSCV-NG13 within the human population and its possible implications for human health and disease.",
