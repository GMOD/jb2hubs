  "description": "Cyclovirus PK5222 is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Cycloviridae. This virus was first identified in the fecal samples of pigs in Pakistan. The genome of Cyclovirus PK5222 is circular and approximately 2.3 kilobases in size, encoding two major open reading frames that are responsible for the replication and structural proteins of the virus.\n\nCycloviruses, including Cyclovirus PK5222, are known to infect a wide range of host species, including mammals, birds, and insects. The exact mechanisms of their transmission and pathogenicity are still under investigation, as the clinical significance of Cyclovirus PK5222 infection in pigs and other animals is not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology, host range, and potential impact of this newly discovered virus.",
