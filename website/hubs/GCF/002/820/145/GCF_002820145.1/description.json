  "description": "Cyclovirus PK5034 is a small, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Cycloviridae. It was first identified in 2010 in fecal samples collected from pigs in Pakistan.\n\nThe viral genome of Cyclovirus PK5034 is circular and approximately 2.1 kilobases in size. It encodes two major open reading frames, which are responsible for the production of the viral replication-associated protein and the capsid protein.\n\nCycloviruses, including Cyclovirus PK5034, are believed to infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. However, the exact host range and pathogenicity of Cyclovirus PK5034 are still under investigation.\n\nThe discovery of Cyclovirus PK5034 and other cycloviruses has expanded our understanding of the diversity and distribution of DNA viruses in the environment, particularly in the context of animal and human health.",
