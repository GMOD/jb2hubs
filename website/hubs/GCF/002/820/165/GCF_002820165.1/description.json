  "description": "Cyclovirus NG12 is a small, circular, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Cycloviridae. This virus was first discovered in a human fecal sample collected in Nigeria in 2012.\n\nThe Cyclovirus NG12 genome is approximately 2 kilobases in size and contains two major open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for a replication-associated protein (Rep) and a capsid protein (Cap). The Rep protein is responsible for the replication of the viral genome, while the Cap protein forms the viral capsid structure.\n\nCyclovirus NG12 is a member of the genus Cyclovirus, which includes a diverse group of viruses found in various animal and human samples. The taxonomic classification and host range of Cyclovirus NG12 are still being investigated, as the understanding of the diversity and epidemiology of this virus group is an active area of research.\n\nThe discovery of Cyclovirus NG12 and other novel cycloviruses has expanded our knowledge of the viral diversity present in the human gut microbiome and has raised questions about their potential impact on human health and their evolutionary relationships with other viruses.",
