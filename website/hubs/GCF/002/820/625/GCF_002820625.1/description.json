  "description": "Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a member of the genus Flavivirus, which is part of the family Flaviviridae. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA virus that is known to cause a severe tick-borne hemorrhagic fever in humans.\n\nKFDV was first identified in 1957 during an outbreak in the Kyasanur Forest of Karnataka, India. The virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, particularly those of the genus Haemaphysalis. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, such as monkeys.\n\nThe virus targets the vascular endothelium, causing increased vascular permeability and coagulation abnormalities. This leads to the characteristic symptoms of Kyasanur Forest disease, which include fever, headache, muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and in some cases, hemorrhagic manifestations and neurological complications.\n\nKFDV is considered a biosafety level 4 pathogen, indicating that it poses a high risk of infection and severe disease in humans. There is currently no specific treatment for Kyasanur Forest disease, and management primarily involves supportive care and symptomatic treatment. Vaccination is available in some endemic regions as a preventive measure.",
