  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 161 (HPV-161) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of humans. HPV-161 is classified as a high-risk HPV type, meaning it is associated with the development of certain types of cancers, particularly cervical cancer.\n\nThe HPV-161 genome is approximately 7,900 base pairs in length and encodes for several viral proteins, including the E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which are known to disrupt the normal cell cycle and lead to cellular transformation. The virus primarily targets the basal layer of the epithelium, where it can establish a persistent infection and undergo viral replication.\n\nHPV-161 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including genital warts, precancerous lesions, and, in some cases, invasive cervical cancer. Regular screening and vaccination are important strategies for the prevention and early detection of HPV-161 infections and associated diseases.",
