  "description": "Corriparta virus is a member of the genus Orbivirus, which belongs to the family Reoviridae. It is an arthropod-borne virus, primarily transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. The virus was first isolated in 1964 from Culicoides spp. collected in the Corriparta region of Queensland, Australia.\n\nCorriparta virus has a double-stranded RNA genome, consisting of ten linear segments. The virus particles are non-enveloped, icosahedral in shape, and approximately 70-80 nanometers in diameter. The virus is capable of infecting a range of vertebrate hosts, including livestock and wildlife, but it is not known to cause significant disease in humans.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that Corriparta virus is widely distributed in Australia and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The virus has been detected in various species of Culicoides midges, as well as in a variety of mammalian hosts, such as cattle, sheep, and wild ruminants. However, the full extent of its host range and the impact on animal health are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the ecology, transmission dynamics, and potential veterinary or public health significance of Corriparta virus, as it remains a relatively understudied member of the Orbivirus genus.",
