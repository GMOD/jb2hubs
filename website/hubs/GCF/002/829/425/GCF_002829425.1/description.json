  "description": "Lebombo virus is a newly discovered virus that belongs to the genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae. It was first isolated in 2018 from ticks collected in the Lebombo mountain range along the border between South Africa and Mozambique.\n\nThe Lebombo virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. The virus is primarily transmitted by ticks, and it has been detected in various tick species in the region where it was first discovered.\n\nPreliminary studies suggest that the Lebombo virus may be pathogenic to humans, potentially causing a febrile illness with symptoms similar to those of other tick-borne diseases, such as fever, headache, and muscle pain. However, the full clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the Lebombo virus are still under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand its potential impact on human health.\n\nThe discovery of the Lebombo virus highlights the importance of ongoing surveillance and research into emerging and potentially zoonotic viruses, particularly in regions where human-animal interactions are common and where environmental changes may facilitate the emergence of new pathogens.",
