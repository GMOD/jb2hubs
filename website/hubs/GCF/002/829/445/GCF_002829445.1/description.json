  "description": "Orungo virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyavirales order. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Orungo virus was first isolated in 1959 from Aedes mosquitoes collected in Orungo, Uganda.\n\nThe virus primarily infects mosquitoes, serving as a vector for transmission to various vertebrate hosts, including humans and domestic animals. Infection in humans can lead to a febrile illness, with symptoms such as headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal distress, though most infections are asymptomatic.\n\nOrungo virus is considered an emerging arbovirus, with the potential for wider geographic distribution and increased public health importance. Further research is needed to better understand its ecology, epidemiology, and potential for causing disease in human and animal populations.",
