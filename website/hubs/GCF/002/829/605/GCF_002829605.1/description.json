  "description": "Pulau reovirus is a species of virus belonging to the family Reoviridae. It was first isolated from a Malayan flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) in the Pulau Tioman island of Malaysia in 1999. \n\nPulau reovirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. It has an icosahedral capsid structure approximately 70-80 nanometers in diameter. The genome of Pulau reovirus consists of 10 linear segments of double-stranded RNA.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that Pulau reovirus is most closely related to other bat-borne reoviruses, suggesting that bats may serve as natural reservoirs for this virus. Further studies are needed to fully understand the ecology, host range, and potential public health implications of Pulau reovirus.",
