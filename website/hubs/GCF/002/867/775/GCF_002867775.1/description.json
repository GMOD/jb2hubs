  "description": "Influenza D virus is a newly identified member of the Orthomyxoviridae family, which includes the more well-known influenza A, B, and C viruses. It was first isolated in 2011 from pigs in the United States and has since been detected in cattle, small ruminants, and humans.\n\nInfluenza D virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. It has a unique genetic and antigenic profile that distinguishes it from other influenza viruses. The virus is believed to be primarily adapted to infect bovine species, but it has also shown the ability to infect and transmit between other animal hosts, including humans.\n\nUnlike the seasonal influenza viruses that commonly infect humans, Influenza D virus does not appear to cause significant disease in humans. However, serological studies have indicated the potential for human exposure and infection, raising concerns about its potential for adaptation and zoonotic transmission.\n\nOngoing research is focused on understanding the ecology, epidemiology, and host range of Influenza D virus, as well as its potential public health implications. Continued surveillance and monitoring of this emerging virus are crucial to assess its impact and guide appropriate public health responses.",
