  "description": "Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, commonly known as the Chinook salmon or king salmon, is a species of anadromous fish in the Pacific salmon genus Oncorhynchus. It is the largest of the Pacific salmon, with adult body lengths typically ranging from 60 to 150 cm and weights from 5 to 45 kg.\n\nChinook salmon are native to the northern Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from the Yukon River in Alaska to the Sacramento River in California. They are an important commercial and recreational fishery species, as well as a significant food source for various predators, including bears, whales, and humans.\n\nThese salmon are known for their distinctive large, hooked beak-like jaws and large, dark spots on their back and upper fins. They have a unique life cycle, migrating from the ocean to their natal freshwater streams and rivers to spawn, often swimming hundreds of kilometers upstream to reach their spawning grounds.\n\nChinook salmon are highly valued for their rich, oily flesh and their importance in both commercial and subsistence fisheries. However, many Chinook salmon populations have experienced declines due to factors such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and the impacts of climate change on their marine and freshwater environments.",
