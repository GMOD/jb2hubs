  "description": "Quercus suber, commonly known as the cork oak, is a species of oak tree that is native to the western Mediterranean region, including parts of Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, and North Africa. It is an evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall and has a distinctive thick, corky bark that is the primary source of commercial cork.\n\nThe leaves of the cork oak are dark green, leathery, and oblong in shape, with a wavy or toothed margin. The acorns produced by the tree are small, typically 2-3 cm in length, and are partially enclosed in a scaly cup.\n\nCork oak trees are well-adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate in which they thrive, with their deep root system and thick bark providing protection from fire and drought. The cork is harvested every 9-12 years by carefully removing the outer layer of bark, a process that does not harm the tree and allows for sustainable cork production.\n\nQuercus suber is an ecologically important species, providing habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, and its cork has been an important commercial and cultural resource for centuries in the regions where it is native.",
