  "description": "Oryzias melastigma, commonly known as the Indian medaka or the Asian medaka, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the genus Oryzias. It is native to the freshwater habitats of India, Bangladesh, and parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Indian medaka is a small fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 3-4 centimeters. It has a slender, elongated body shape with a pointed snout. The coloration of the fish can vary, but generally, the dorsal (upper) side is olive-green or brownish, while the ventral (lower) side is lighter, often with a silvery or yellowish hue.\n\nOryzias melastigma is a member of the rice fish family, Adrianichthyidae, and is closely related to the more well-known Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). Like other medaka species, the Indian medaka is known for its small size, hardy nature, and its ability to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions, including brackish water and even slightly saline habitats.\n\nThe species is of interest to researchers and aquarium enthusiasts due to its potential as a model organism for various studies, including developmental biology, toxicology, and behavioral research. Its small size, rapid life cycle, and ease of maintenance in laboratory settings make it a valuable tool for scientific investigations.",
