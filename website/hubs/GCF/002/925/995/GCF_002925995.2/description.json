  "description": "Terrapene triunguis, commonly known as the three-toed box turtle, is a species of box turtle native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized turtle, typically measuring between 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) in carapace (upper shell) length.\n\nThe three-toed box turtle is characterized by its distinctive three toes on each hind foot, which gives it its common name. Its carapace is typically domed and can range in color from brown to black, often with yellow or orange markings. The plastron (lower shell) is hinged, allowing the turtle to completely close its shell for protection.\n\nThese turtles are primarily terrestrial, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including deciduous forests, pine savannas, and grasslands. They are omnivorous, feeding on a diet that includes insects, small vertebrates, fruits, and vegetation.\n\nThe three-toed box turtle is a relatively long-lived species, with individuals potentially reaching ages of 50 to 80 years. They are known for their slow growth and delayed sexual maturity, which can contribute to their conservation challenges.\n\nDue to habitat loss, fragmentation, and collection for the pet trade, the three-toed box turtle is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions of its range. Efforts are ongoing to protect and preserve this unique turtle species.",
