  "description": "Candidozyma duobushaemuli is a species of yeast that belongs to the Candidozyma genus. It was first isolated from the gut of the insect Haemulus species, which is found in China.\n\nThe key characteristics of Candidozyma duobushaemuli are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: It reproduces asexually by budding and the cells are spherical to ellipsoidal in shape.\n\n2. Physiology: It is a aerobic yeast that can assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources for growth. It has the ability to ferment glucose.\n\n3. Taxonomy: Phylogenetic analysis based on the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit rRNA gene sequence places Candidozyma duobushaemuli within the Candidozyma clade, which is a member of the Saccharomycetales order.\n\n4. Habitat: This yeast species was originally isolated from the gut of the insect Haemulus species, indicating it has an association with this insect host.\n\nOverall, Candidozyma duobushaemuli is a newly described yeast species that exhibits characteristics typical of the Candidozyma genus and appears to have a symbiotic relationship with its insect host.",
