  "description": "Shigella sonnei is a species of Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Shigella. It is the most common cause of shigellosis, a type of bacillary dysentery, in developed countries.\n\nS. sonnei is a facultative anaerobic bacterium, meaning it can grow in both the presence and absence of oxygen. It is nonspore-forming and motile, with peritrichous flagella. The bacterium is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family and is closely related to Escherichia coli.\n\nS. sonnei is known for its ability to invade and colonize the epithelial cells of the human intestine, leading to the characteristic symptoms of shigellosis, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The bacteria can also spread through person-to-person contact, contaminated food or water, and poor hygiene practices.\n\nDiagnosis of S. sonnei infection typically involves culturing the bacteria from stool samples or serological testing. Treatment often includes supportive care and, in severe cases, the use of appropriate antibiotics, although the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains is a growing concern.\n\nUnderstanding the biology and epidemiology of S. sonnei is crucial for developing effective prevention and control strategies to reduce the burden of shigellosis in both developed and developing countries.",
