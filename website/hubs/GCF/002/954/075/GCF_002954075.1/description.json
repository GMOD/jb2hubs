  "description": "Cryptococcus deuterogattii R265 is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the Cryptococcus genus. It is a member of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, which is known to cause cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection in humans and animals.\n\nCryptococcus deuterogattii R265 is a basidiomycetous yeast that can be found in the environment, particularly in soil and pigeon droppings. It is considered a variety or subspecies of Cryptococcus gattii, which was previously classified as a separate species but is now recognized as part of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex.\n\nThe R265 strain of Cryptococcus deuterogattii is particularly notable for its high virulence and ability to cause severe infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. It has been associated with outbreaks of cryptococcosis in various regions and is known to have a significant impact on public health.\n\nCryptococcus deuterogattii R265 can be identified through molecular techniques, such as DNA sequencing or multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which can distinguish it from other Cryptococcus species and strains. Understanding the characteristics and epidemiology of this fungal species is important for the management and prevention of cryptococcosis in clinical and public health settings.",
