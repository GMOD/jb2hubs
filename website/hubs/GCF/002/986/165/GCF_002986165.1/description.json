  "description": "Torque teno virus 17 (TTV-17) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the Anelloviridae family. It is a member of the Alphatorquevirus genus, which includes various species of Torque teno viruses (TTVs) that are known to infect humans and other vertebrates.\n\nTTV-17 is a circular, negative-sense, single-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 3.8 to 3.9 kilobases. The viral genome encodes several proteins, including the viral capsid protein, which is responsible for the viral particle's structure and host cell attachment.\n\nTTVs, including TTV-17, are commonly found in the human population, with a high prevalence rate in both healthy individuals and those with various medical conditions. The precise role of TTV-17 in human health and disease is not yet fully understood, as the virus is often found as a co-infection with other pathogens or in the absence of any apparent clinical symptoms.\n\nFurther research is needed to elucidate the potential pathogenic or commensal nature of TTV-17 and its interactions with the human host and other microorganisms within the human microbiome.",
