  "description": "Human papillomavirus 184 (HPV184) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various species, including humans. HPV184 is a specific genotype within the human papillomavirus (HPV) species, which is known to cause a range of infections and diseases in humans.\n\nHPV184 is a double-stranded circular DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 8,000 base pairs. Like other HPV genotypes, HPV184 has a distinctive genomic organization, including early (E) and late (L) genes that encode for proteins involved in viral replication, transcription, and capsid formation.\n\nThe primary mode of transmission for HPV184 is through direct skin-to-skin contact or sexual contact with an infected individual. HPV184 can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including the development of warts, precancerous lesions, and in some cases, the progression to certain types of cancer, particularly those affecting the anogenital region.\n\nOngoing research and surveillance are essential to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential impact of HPV184 on human health. The development and implementation of effective prevention strategies, such as vaccination and early detection, remain crucial in the management and control of HPV-related diseases.",
