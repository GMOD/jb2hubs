  "description": "The Central Chimpanzee Simian Foamy Virus (SFV) is a retrovirus that belongs to the Spumavirus genus within the Retroviridae family. It is primarily found in the Central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), a subspecies of the common chimpanzee.\n\nSimian foamy viruses are non-pathogenic, persistent, and typically do not cause any known disease in their natural hosts, including the Central chimpanzee. These viruses are characterized by their unique cytopathic effect, which appears as a \"foamy\" or \"bubbly\" appearance in infected cells.\n\nThe Central Chimpanzee SFV has a genome composed of single-stranded RNA and is capable of integrating into the host's DNA, establishing a lifelong infection. The virus is primarily transmitted through close contact, such as biting or scratching, between infected chimpanzees or from chimpanzees to humans during zoonotic spillover events.\n\nWhile the Central Chimpanzee SFV is not known to cause any significant health issues in humans, it is of scientific interest as it provides insights into the co-evolution of retroviruses and their primate hosts, as well as the potential for cross-species transmission and the development of novel zoonotic diseases.",
