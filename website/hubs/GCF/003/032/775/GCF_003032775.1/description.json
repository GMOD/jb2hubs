  "description": "Guenon simian foamy virus (GSFV) is a species of retrovirus that belongs to the genus Spumavirus, within the family Retroviridae. Foamy viruses, also known as spumaviruses, are a unique group of viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian species, including primates, felines, and bovines.\n\nGSFV is primarily found in various species of guenons, a group of Old World monkeys native to Africa. These viruses are believed to have co-evolved with their primate hosts over millions of years, resulting in a relatively benign and persistent infection in the majority of infected individuals.\n\nStructurally, GSFV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. The viral genome contains three major genes: gag, pol, and env, which encode the structural and enzymatic proteins required for viral replication and assembly. Additionally, GSFV possesses a unique regulatory region that is responsible for the characteristic \"foamy\" or \"bubbly\" cytopathic effect observed in infected cells.\n\nTransmission of GSFV within guenon populations is thought to occur primarily through close contact, such as grooming or nursing behavior. While the virus is not known to cause significant disease in its natural primate hosts, it has been studied extensively as a model system for understanding retroviral biology and the complex interactions between viruses and their long-term hosts.",
