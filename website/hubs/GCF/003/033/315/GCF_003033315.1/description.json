  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no scientific information available about a species called \"Cutavirus.\" This appears to be a made-up or fictional name, as there is no known virus or other organism in the scientific literature with this name. Viruses, like other organisms, are typically named based on their genetic characteristics, host preferences, or other distinguishing features that can be verified through scientific investigation and classification. Without any real data or description, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description for this hypothetical \"Cutavirus\" species. If you have additional details about the characteristics or origins of this proposed organism, I would be happy to try to research and summarize the relevant scientific information. However, based on the information provided, this appears to be a non-existent or fictional entity.",
