  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called \"Human associated huchismacovirus 3\". This appears to be a made-up name that does not correspond to any actual, scientifically described virus species.\n\nViruses are typically named based on their genetic characteristics, origin, or the disease they cause. The naming conventions are established by international scientific organizations such as the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).\n\nWithout any real scientific data or description about this hypothetical virus, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description for it. Viral taxonomy and classification requires rigorous genetic and biological analysis that has not been done for this fictitious virus name.\n\nIn general, a scientific description of a virus species would include details about its genomic structure, morphology, host range, mode of transmission, and the disease it causes, if any. But in the absence of actual scientific evidence, I cannot fabricate such details for a made-up virus name.",
