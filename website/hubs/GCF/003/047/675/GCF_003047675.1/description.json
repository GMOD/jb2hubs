  "description": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) Benin 97/1 is a highly virulent strain of the ASFV, which is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF). ASFV is a DNA virus belonging to the family Asfarviridae, genus Asfivirus.\n\nThe Benin 97/1 strain of ASFV was isolated from an outbreak of ASF in Benin, West Africa, in 1997. This strain is known to be highly pathogenic, causing acute and often fatal disease in domestic pigs and wild boar.\n\nGenetically, the Benin 97/1 strain is classified as belonging to the genotype I of ASFV, which is commonly found in West and Central Africa. This strain has a genome size of approximately 170-190 kilobase pairs, encoding over 150 proteins involved in virus replication, host immune evasion, and other critical functions.\n\nASFV Benin 97/1 is transmitted primarily through direct contact with infected animals or their bodily fluids, as well as through tick vectors of the genus Ornithodoros. The virus can also be transmitted via contaminated fomites, such as feed, equipment, or clothing.\n\nInfection with the Benin 97/1 strain typically results in a severe, hemorrhagic form of ASF, with high mortality rates (up to 100%) in susceptible pig populations. The development of effective vaccines and control strategies against this and other ASFV strains remains an ongoing challenge in the field of veterinary virology.",
