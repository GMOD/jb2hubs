  "description": "The African swine fever virus (ASFV) E75 is a strain of the ASFV, which is a large, double-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Asfarviridae. The ASFV E75 strain is a highly virulent and lethal strain of the virus, primarily affecting domestic and wild pigs.\n\nThe ASFV E75 strain is known to cause the disease African swine fever (ASF), which is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease in pigs. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their bodily fluids, or contaminated objects, as well as through the bite of infected soft ticks.\n\nThe ASFV E75 strain is characterized by its ability to rapidly replicate and spread within the host, leading to severe clinical symptoms, such as high fever, loss of appetite, respiratory distress, and internal hemorrhaging. The virus primarily targets the lymphoid and mononuclear phagocytic systems, causing widespread tissue damage and organ failure.\n\nDue to the high mortality rate associated with the ASFV E75 strain and the lack of effective vaccines or treatments, the disease poses a significant threat to the pork industry and food security in affected regions. Effective biosecurity measures, surveillance, and control strategies are essential for preventing and managing outbreaks of African swine fever caused by the ASFV E75 strain.",
