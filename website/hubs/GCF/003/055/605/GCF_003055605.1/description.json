  "description": "Human papillomavirus 187 (HPV187) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, a group of small, non-enveloped DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various organisms, including humans. HPV187 is considered a high-risk type of HPV, as it is associated with the development of cervical cancer and other anogenital cancers.\n\nThe HPV187 genome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that encodes several viral proteins responsible for viral replication, transcription, and the manipulation of the host cell's cellular machinery. The virus primarily targets the basal epithelial cells of the cervix, where it can establish a persistent infection, leading to the development of precancerous lesions and, in some cases, invasive cervical cancer.\n\nHPV187 is transmitted through sexual contact and can be detected using molecular diagnostic techniques, such as DNA-based HPV testing or cytological evaluation of cervical samples. Vaccination and regular cervical cancer screening are important measures for the prevention and early detection of HPV-related diseases.",
