  "description": "Triticum urartu is a wild diploid wheat species that is considered a progenitor of modern cultivated wheat. It is a wild grass native to the Fertile Crescent region, particularly in parts of the Middle East, including Armenia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Turkey.\n\nTriticum urartu is a self-pollinating annual grass that grows up to 1 meter tall. It has a compact spike-like inflorescence with spikelets arranged in two rows. The spikelets contain two to three florets, each with a single grain. The grains are small, typically around 5-7 mm long, with a red or brown coloration.\n\nGenetically, Triticum urartu is classified as a diploid species, with a chromosome number of 2n=14. It is believed to have played a crucial role in the evolution of modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other polyploid wheat species through hybridization and genome contributions.\n\nTriticum urartu is an important genetic resource for wheat breeding programs, as it harbors valuable traits such as disease resistance, stress tolerance, and potentially unique nutritional properties. Understanding the genomic and evolutionary history of this wild wheat species can provide insights into the genetic diversity and adaptation of cultivated wheat.",
