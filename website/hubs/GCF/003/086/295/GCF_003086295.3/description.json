  "description": "Arachis hypogaea, commonly known as the peanut or groundnut, is a leguminous plant species that is widely cultivated for its edible seeds. It is a member of the genus Arachis, which is native to South America.\n\nThe peanut plant is an annual herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 30-50 cm. It has a prostrate growth habit, with a taproot system and branching stems that produce leaves, flowers, and eventually the fruit or \"nuts.\" The leaves are compound, with four leaflets arranged in a pinnate pattern.\n\nThe flowers of the peanut plant are small and yellow, and they are produced in clusters along the stem. After pollination, the flower stalks elongate and bend downwards, burying the developing fruit (the peanut) in the soil, where it matures underground.\n\nThe peanut itself is not a true nut, but rather a legume that develops underground. It consists of a thin, papery shell that encloses one to four edible seeds or kernels. Peanuts are a rich source of protein, oil, and various vitamins and minerals, making them an important food crop worldwide.\n\nArachis hypogaea is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, with major producers including China, India, the United States, and several African countries. It is a versatile crop, used in various food products, as well as for oil production and animal feed.",
