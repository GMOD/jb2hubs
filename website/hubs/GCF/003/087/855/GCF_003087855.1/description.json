  "description": "Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV) is a member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is a tick-borne, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes a severe febrile illness in humans.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, particularly those belonging to the Haemaphysalis and Amblyomma genera. Upon infection, the virus can target various cell types, including endothelial cells, hepatocytes, and leukocytes, leading to a range of clinical manifestations.\n\nThe hallmark features of SFTSV infection include high fever, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and multi-organ dysfunction, such as hepatic and renal impairment. In severe cases, the virus can cause hemorrhagic complications and a high mortality rate, which can reach up to 30% in some regions.\n\nSFTSV is primarily found in East Asian countries, such as China, Japan, and South Korea, where it has emerged as a significant public health concern. Ongoing research focuses on developing effective diagnostic tools, vaccines, and therapeutic interventions to combat this emerging infectious disease.",
