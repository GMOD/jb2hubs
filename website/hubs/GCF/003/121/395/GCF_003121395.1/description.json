  "description": "Bubalus bubalis, commonly known as the water buffalo, is a large bovine species native to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. They are typically found in marshes, swamps, and shallow waters, where they use their broad, flat hooves to navigate the muddy terrain.\n\nWater buffaloes are characterized by their large, stocky build, with an average height of around 1.5 to 1.7 meters at the shoulder. They have a distinct, heavily wrinkled skin that ranges in color from grayish-black to reddish-brown. One of the most distinctive features of the water buffalo is their large, curved horns, which can grow up to 2.4 meters in length.\n\nThese animals are adapted to their aquatic habitat, with the ability to submerge themselves in water to regulate their body temperature and avoid heat stress. They are also known for their strong social behavior, often forming herds and engaging in cooperative activities.\n\nWater buffaloes are an important livestock species, providing milk, meat, and power for agricultural activities in many parts of the world. They are also considered a symbol of cultural and religious significance in various Asian societies.",
