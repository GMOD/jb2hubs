  "description": "Acaromyces ingoldii is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a member of the class Saccharomycetes, which includes many yeast species. Acaromyces ingoldii is considered an anamorphic species, meaning that its full life cycle includes both a sexual (teleomorphic) and an asexual (anamorphic) stage.\n\nThis fungus was first isolated and described by mycologist C.T. Ingold in 1943 from decaying wood samples. It is known to be a saprotroph, meaning it derives its nutrients from the decomposition of organic matter in its environment.\n\nAcaromyces ingoldii produces small, white to cream-colored colonies when grown on culture media. Its cells are typically ovoid to spherical in shape and reproduce asexually through budding. The species is characterized by the formation of small, smooth-walled ascospores within its sexual fruiting bodies.\n\nWhile not widely studied, Acaromyces ingoldii is considered an ecologically important decomposer fungus, playing a role in the recycling of nutrients in forest and woodland habitats where it is commonly found.",
