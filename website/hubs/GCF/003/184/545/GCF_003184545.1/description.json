  "description": "Aspergillus heteromorphus CBS 117.55 is a species of filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It is a member of the Aspergillus section Fumigati, which includes several species known to be opportunistic pathogens that can cause invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe strain CBS 117.55 was originally isolated and deposited in the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection. This particular strain exhibits morphological characteristics that are distinct from other Aspergillus species, including the production of heteromorphic conidiophores (stalks that bear the asexual spores).\n\nAspergillus heteromorphus is known to grow on various laboratory media, forming colonies with a velvety or powdery texture and a range of colors, including white, yellow, or green. Microscopically, the fungus produces septate hyphae, globose to subglobose vesicles, and phialides (specialized conidiophore cells) that give rise to the characteristic conidial chains.\n\nFurther research on the physiology, genetics, and potential clinical relevance of this Aspergillus species may provide additional insights into its ecology, taxonomy, and potential impact on human health.",
