  "description": "Aspergillus niger CBS 101883 is a filamentous fungus belonging to the genus Aspergillus. It is a common mold found in the environment, particularly in soil, decaying organic matter, and various food and agricultural products.\n\nAspergillus niger is a saprobic organism, meaning it can decompose and utilize a wide range of organic substrates as a source of nutrients for its growth and development. It is known for its ability to produce various enzymes and secondary metabolites, including citric acid, which is an important industrial product.\n\nMorphologically, Aspergillus niger has a characteristic black or dark-colored appearance due to the production of dark-pigmented spores (conidia) borne on specialized structures called conidiophores. The fungus grows as a dense, velvety colony on suitable media, with a rapid growth rate.\n\nAspergillus niger CBS 101883 is a well-studied strain that has been used in various research and industrial applications, particularly in the production of enzymes, organic acids, and other valuable compounds. Its genome has been sequenced, and it serves as a model organism for understanding the biology and genetics of Aspergillus species.",
