  "description": "Aspergillus fijiensis CBS 313.89 is a species of filamentous fungus that belongs to the genus Aspergillus. It was first isolated in Fiji and given the strain designation CBS 313.89 by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) culture collection.\n\nAspergillus fijiensis is a member of the Aspergillus section Fumigati, which includes several important pathogenic species of Aspergillus. The species is characterized by its production of green-colored conidiophores and conidia, as well as its ability to grow at temperatures up to 45Â°C.\n\nMorphologically, the fungus produces a dense, velvety green colony on agar media, with a characteristic radial growth pattern. Microscopically, the conidiophores are smooth-walled, with a globose vesicle bearing phialides that produce long chains of green-pigmented conidia.\n\nAspergillus fijiensis CBS 313.89 is of interest to researchers due to its potential involvement in opportunistic infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, the strain may have applications in biotechnology, such as the production of enzymes or the degradation of certain compounds.",
