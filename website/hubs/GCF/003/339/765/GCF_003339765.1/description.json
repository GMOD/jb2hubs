  "description": "Macaca mulatta, commonly known as the rhesus macaque, is a species of Old World monkey that belongs to the genus Macaca. The rhesus macaque is native to South, Central, and East Asia, with its range extending from Afghanistan to China and Japan.\n\nPhysically, the rhesus macaque is a medium-sized primate, with a robust body and a distinctive reddish-pink face. They have a thick, greyish-brown fur coat that can vary in color, and their tail is relatively short compared to their body size. Adult males typically weigh between 7 to 12 kilograms, while females are slightly smaller, weighing 5 to 8 kilograms.\n\nBehaviorally, the rhesus macaque is a highly social animal, living in large, hierarchical troops that can range from a few individuals to over 200 members. They are known for their complex social interactions, which involve a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body postures. These primates are also highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even urban areas.\n\nRhesus macaques are important subjects in medical research, particularly in the fields of neuroscience, genetics, and infectious disease research. Their genetic similarity to humans, combined with their relatively large brain size and complex social behavior, make them valuable model organisms for studying various aspects of human biology and behavior.",
