  "description": "Dromaius novaehollandiae, commonly known as the emu, is a large flightless bird native to Australia. It is the second-largest living bird species in the world, after the ostrich.\n\nEmus are members of the ratite family, which includes other flightless birds such as ostriches, rheas, and cassowaries. They have a distinctive appearance with long, slender necks, small heads, and powerful legs adapted for running. Their feathers are generally brown or grey, providing camouflage in their natural habitat.\n\nEmus are known for their unique breeding behavior, where the male incubates the eggs and cares for the chicks after hatching. They are herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, seeds, and insects. Emus are well-adapted to the harsh Australian environment, with the ability to conserve water and regulate their body temperature effectively.\n\nEmus play an important role in the ecosystem, acting as seed dispersers and contributing to the biodiversity of their native habitats. They are also an iconic symbol of Australia and have been integrated into the country's culture and history.",
