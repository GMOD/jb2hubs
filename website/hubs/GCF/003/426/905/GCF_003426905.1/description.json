  "description": "Ctenocephalides felis, commonly known as the cat flea, is a small insect that belongs to the order Siphonaptera. It is a parasitic species that primarily infests domestic cats and dogs, but can also occasionally affect humans.\n\nThe cat flea is a flattened, wingless insect with a body length of approximately 2-3 millimeters. It has a tough, reddish-brown exoskeleton and a pair of powerful hind legs that enable it to jump long distances. The flea's body is covered with numerous backward-facing bristles, which help it move through the fur of its host.\n\nThe cat flea has a unique life cycle that includes four distinct stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Females lay their eggs on the host animal, and the larvae subsequently hatch and feed on organic matter found in the host's environment, such as dried blood, feces, and skin debris. The pupal stage is followed by the emergence of the adult flea, which then seeks out a host to feed upon.\n\nCtenocephalides felis is known to transmit several diseases and parasites, including the bacterial disease murine typhus and the parasitic tapeworm Dipylidium caninum. Its bites can also cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in both animals and humans.\n\nDue to its widespread distribution and ability to rapidly reproduce, the cat flea is considered a significant pest in many regions of the world, and effective control measures are often necessary to manage infestations.",
