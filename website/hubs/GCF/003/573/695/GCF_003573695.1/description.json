  "description": "Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy or breadseed poppy, is an annual flowering plant species belonging to the Papaveraceae family. This species is native to the Mediterranean region and is widely cultivated for the production of opium, a narcotic substance extracted from its seed pods.\n\nThe Papaver somniferum plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to purple, pink, or red. The plant's leaves are deeply lobed and blue-green in color. The most distinctive feature of this species is its seed pod, which contains the opium-rich latex. The opium is extracted from the pod and processed for use in various pharmaceutical and recreational applications.\n\nPapaver somniferum is an important crop plant, as it is the primary source of opium alkaloids, such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine, which are used in the production of various pain-relieving and narcotic drugs. However, the cultivation and use of this plant are heavily regulated due to its potential for abuse and recreational use.",
