  "description": "Norovirus GII.17 is a strain of the Norovirus genus that belongs to the Caliciviridae family. Noroviruses are non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are known to be a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.\n\nThe GII.17 strain is a genotype within the genogroup II (GII) of Noroviruses, which is the most common and diverse genogroup affecting humans. The GII.17 strain was first identified in 2014 and has since been detected in outbreaks in various parts of the world, often replacing the previously dominant GII.4 strains.\n\nNorovirus GII.17 is highly contagious and can be transmitted through contact with infected individuals, contaminated food or water, or environmental surfaces. The virus primarily targets the gastrointestinal tract, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Infection with Norovirus GII.17 can lead to severe dehydration, especially in vulnerable populations like the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised individuals.\n\nOngoing surveillance and research on the evolution and epidemiology of Norovirus GII.17 are crucial for understanding its potential impact on public health and developing effective prevention and control strategies.",
