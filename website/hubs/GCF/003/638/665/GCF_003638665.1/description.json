  "description": "Norovirus GII.2 is a genotype of the Norovirus genus, which belongs to the Caliciviridae family. Noroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses known to be a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide.\n\nThe GII.2 genotype is classified within the GII genogroup, which is the most prevalent and diverse group of human Noroviruses. Strains within the GII.2 genotype are characterized by specific genetic and antigenic properties that distinguish them from other Norovirus genotypes.\n\nNorovirus GII.2 is transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, often associated with contaminated food or water, as well as person-to-person contact. Infection with this genotype can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain, typically lasting for 1-3 days.\n\nNorovirus GII.2 has demonstrated the ability to evolve and cause outbreaks globally, highlighting the importance of ongoing surveillance and research to understand its epidemiology and develop effective prevention and control strategies.",
