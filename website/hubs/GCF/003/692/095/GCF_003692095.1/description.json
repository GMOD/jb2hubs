  "description": "Arthrobacter phage Corgi is a bacteriophage, a virus that specifically infects and replicates within the bacterial genus Arthrobacter. Arthrobacter is a genus of Gram-positive, aerobic bacteria commonly found in soil environments.\n\nArthrobacter phage Corgi is a tailed phage, belonging to the order Caudovirales. It has an icosahedral head structure and a contractile tail, which it uses to attach to and inject its genetic material into the host Arthrobacter cell. The phage genome is composed of double-stranded DNA.\n\nAs a lytic phage, Arthrobacter phage Corgi can hijack the host's cellular machinery to produce new phage particles, eventually causing the host cell to lyse and release the progeny virions. This lytic lifecycle allows the phage to propagate and spread to infect other Arthrobacter bacteria in the surrounding environment.\n\nThe specific characteristics and potential applications of Arthrobacter phage Corgi, such as its host range, genomic features, or potential use in biotechnology or phage therapy, are not well-documented in the publicly available scientific literature.",
