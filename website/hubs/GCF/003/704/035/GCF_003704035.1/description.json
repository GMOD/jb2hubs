  "description": "Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii, commonly known as the Bailey's deer mouse or the prairie deer mouse, is a subspecies of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) found in North America. It is a small, nocturnal rodent that belongs to the family Cricetidae.\n\nThe Bailey's deer mouse is characterized by its soft, dense fur that can range in color from pale grayish-brown to reddish-brown on the upper parts, with a sharply demarcated white underside. It has large, prominent eyes and rounded ears. Its tail is relatively long, often as long as the head and body combined, and is bicolored, with a dark upper surface and a lighter underside.\n\nThis subspecies is adapted to live in various habitats, including grasslands, prairies, and agricultural areas. It is an important prey species for many predators and plays a significant role in the ecosystem as a seed disperser and consumer of invertebrates.\n\nPeromyscus maniculatus bairdii is known for its high reproductive rate, with females capable of producing multiple litters per year. It is widely distributed across the central and eastern regions of the United States and Canada, and its population status is generally considered stable.",
