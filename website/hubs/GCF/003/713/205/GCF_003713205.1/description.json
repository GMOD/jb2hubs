  "description": "Coffea eugenioides is a species of coffee plant that belongs to the genus Coffea, within the family Rubiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub or tree native to East Africa, particularly found in the highlands of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.\n\nThe Coffea eugenioides plant typically grows to a height of 3-6 meters, with a slender, upright stem and a compact, rounded canopy. The leaves are simple, oblong-lanceolate in shape, dark green in color, and measure around 10-15 cm in length.\n\nThe flowers of Coffea eugenioides are small, white, and fragrant, forming in clusters along the branches. The fruits, known as coffee cherries, are ovoid in shape, dark red when ripe, and contain a single seed, commonly referred to as a \"coffee bean.\"\n\nThe coffee beans of Coffea eugenioides are known for their unique flavor profile, often described as delicate, floral, and with hints of citrus or berry notes. The species is considered a rare and valuable variety within the specialty coffee industry, prized for its distinct characteristics and limited availability.\n\nCoffea eugenioides is adapted to grow in the cool, humid, and well-drained conditions of the African highlands, typically found at elevations between 1,500 and 2,000 meters above sea level. It is an important genetic resource for coffee research and breeding programs, as it possesses valuable traits that may be beneficial for improving the quality and resilience of other coffee species.",
