  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no scientific information available about a species called \"Human feces pecovirus.\" This appears to be a made-up name, as there is no known virus with this specific designation.\n\nViruses that infect humans and are found in human fecal matter do exist, but they would have proper scientific names and classifications assigned by virologists and microbiologists. Without more details about the specific characteristics and properties of this hypothetical \"Human feces pecovirus,\" I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description.\n\nIn the future, if you have a question about a real, documented virus or other biological entity, I would be happy to research and summarize the relevant scientific information to the best of my abilities. However, for made-up names or species, I cannot generate a reliable scientific description.",
