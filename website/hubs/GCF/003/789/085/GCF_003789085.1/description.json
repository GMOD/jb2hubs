  "description": "Penaeus vannamei, commonly known as the Pacific white shrimp or whiteleg shrimp, is a species of marine crustacean belonging to the family Penaeidae. It is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, found along the coasts of Mexico, Central America, and northern South America.\n\nPenaeus vannamei is a decapod shrimp, meaning it has ten legs. It has a translucent, white or pale gray body with distinctive dark spots or blotches on its carapace and abdomen. The shrimp can grow up to 23 centimeters (9 inches) in length, though the average size is around 15-20 centimeters.\n\nThis species is widely cultivated in aquaculture, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions, due to its rapid growth, tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, and high market demand. Penaeus vannamei is an important commercial species and a significant contributor to the global shrimp industry.\n\nIn terms of its ecology, Penaeus vannamei lives in coastal and estuarine habitats, where it feeds on a variety of small organisms, such as plankton, detritus, and small invertebrates. The species plays a vital role in the marine food web, serving as prey for larger predators.",
