  "description": "Norovirus GI/Hu/JP/2007/GI.P3_GI.3/Shimizu/KK2866 is a strain of norovirus, a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis in humans. Noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, which is part of the Caliciviridae family.\n\nThis specific strain of norovirus was isolated in Japan in 2007 and is classified as a genotype I (GI) norovirus, with a polymerase genotype of GI.P3 and a capsid genotype of GI.3. The strain was named after the location where it was first identified, Shimizu, and the isolate number is KK2866.\n\nNoroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that primarily infect the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other mammals. They are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Noroviruses are highly contagious and can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, as well as direct person-to-person contact.\n\nThe genetic and molecular characteristics of Norovirus GI/Hu/JP/2007/GI.P3_GI.3/Shimizu/KK2866 may provide insights into its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and potential for causing outbreaks, which is important for understanding and managing the public health impact of this virus.",
