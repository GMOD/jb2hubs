  "description": "Abrus precatorius, commonly known as rosary pea or crab's eye, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas.\n\nThe plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets. The flowers are pea-like in appearance, typically red, pink, or white in color. The most distinctive feature of Abrus precatorius is its seeds, which are small, hard, and brightly colored, often in a distinctive red and black pattern.\n\nThe seeds of Abrus precatorius are highly toxic, containing the potent toxin abrin, which can be fatal if ingested. Despite this, the plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine in various cultures, with the seeds and other parts of the plant being used for a variety of purposes, including as a source of natural dyes.\n\nAbrus precatorius is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to rapidly spread and outcompete native plants. Conservation efforts and responsible cultivation are important to ensure the sustainable management of this species.",
