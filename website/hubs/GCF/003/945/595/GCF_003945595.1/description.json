  "description": "Pipra filicauda, commonly known as the wire-tailed manakin, is a small, brightly-colored passerine bird species found in the forests of South America. It belongs to the manakin family, Pipridae, which are known for their elaborate courtship displays and unique physical characteristics.\n\nThe wire-tailed manakin is characterized by its striking plumage, with the male having a black head, back, and wings, a bright red crown, and a distinctive pair of elongated, wire-like central tail feathers. The female is mostly green in color. These birds are relatively small, typically measuring around 10-11 cm in length.\n\nPipra filicauda is primarily found in the tropical and subtropical forests of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are known to be social and often observed in small groups, foraging for insects and small fruits. The species is particularly renowned for its complex courtship rituals, where males perform intricate, acrobatic displays to attract mates.\n\nThe wire-tailed manakin is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), indicating that its population is stable and not currently facing a high risk of extinction. However, like many forest-dwelling species, it may be vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation due to deforestation and human activities.",
