  "description": "Corapipa altera, commonly known as the white-ruffed manakin, is a small passerine bird species belonging to the manakin family, Pipridae. It is native to Central and South America, primarily found in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests.\n\nThe white-ruffed manakin is a small bird, measuring approximately 10-11 cm in length and weighing around 12-15 grams. The male has a striking appearance, with a black head, back, and wings, and a bright white ruff around the neck. The female is more drab in coloration, with olive-green plumage.\n\nThese birds are known for their unique courtship displays, where males perform elaborate leaps and wing-snapping displays to attract females. They are primarily frugivorous, feeding on a variety of small fruits and berries found in their forest habitat.\n\nThe white-ruffed manakin is classified as a Least Concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a large and stable population throughout its range. However, habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation remain threats to the species' long-term survival.",
