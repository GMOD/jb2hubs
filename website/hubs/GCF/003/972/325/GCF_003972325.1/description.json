  "description": "Human coronavirus OC43 is a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, which is part of the Coronaviridae family. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects the upper respiratory tract of humans.\n\nOC43 is one of the four common human coronaviruses, along with HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. It is believed to have originated from a zoonotic transmission event, potentially from bovine coronavirus.\n\nThe virus utilizes the human cellular receptor N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) to gain entry into host cells. Once inside, it hijacks the host's cellular machinery to replicate and assemble new viral particles, which are then released to infect other cells.\n\nOC43 is primarily associated with causing common cold-like symptoms, such as runny nose, sore throat, and cough. In some cases, it can also lead to more severe respiratory illnesses, particularly in vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or individuals with underlying health conditions.\n\nOngoing research aims to better understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions for human coronavirus OC43 infections.",
