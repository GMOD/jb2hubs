  "description": "California encephalitis virus (CEV) is a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is a zoonotic virus primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, specifically Aedes and Culex species, and can infect both humans and animals.\n\nThe virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus with a segmented genome. The three genomic segments encode the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the glycoprotein (G) precursor, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) protein.\n\nCEV is primarily found in the western United States and Canada, and it is associated with various clinical manifestations in humans, including febrile illness, meningitis, and encephalitis. The virus can cause severe neurological complications, particularly in children, and may lead to long-term neurological sequelae in some cases.\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that CEV is maintained in nature through a cycle involving small rodents, such as ground squirrels and chipmunks, which serve as the primary reservoir hosts. Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected reservoir hosts and then transmit it to humans and other susceptible hosts during subsequent blood meals.\n\nThe diagnosis of CEV infection typically involves serological testing, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or neutralization assays, to detect the presence of specific antibodies. Treatment for CEV infection is primarily supportive, focusing on managing the symptoms and complications associated with the disease.\n\nPrevention and control measures for CEV include mosquito control, personal protective measures (e.g., use of insect repellents), and public health education to raise awareness about the risks and appropriate preventive actions.",
