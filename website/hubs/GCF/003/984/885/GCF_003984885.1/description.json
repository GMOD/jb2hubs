  "description": "Neopelma chrysocephalum, commonly known as the golden-crowned manakin, is a species of bird that belongs to the manakin family, Pipridae. This small passerine bird is native to the tropical forests of northeastern Brazil, eastern Venezuela, and the Guianas.\n\nThe golden-crowned manakin is approximately 11-12 cm in length and has a distinctive appearance. The male bird has a bright golden-yellow crown, a black face, and olive-green upperparts. The underparts are pale yellow. Females have a duller overall appearance, with olive-green upperparts and pale yellowish-white underparts.\n\nThese manakins are known for their lekking behavior, where males gather in small groups and perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females. The displays often involve jumping, wing-flapping, and vocalizations. The female builds a small, cup-shaped nest and incubates the eggs alone.\n\nNeopelma chrysocephalum primarily forages for small fruits, berries, and insects within the dense foliage of the forest canopy. They are an important component of the avian community in their native habitat, contributing to seed dispersal and ecosystem function.\n\nThe species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as it has a relatively wide distribution and is not facing significant threats at the moment. However, ongoing habitat loss and fragmentation in some parts of its range may pose a potential risk to the species in the future.",
