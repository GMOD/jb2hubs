  "description": "Eumetopias jubatus, commonly known as the Steller sea lion, is a large species of sea lion found in the northern Pacific Ocean. The species is named after the German naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described it in 1742.\n\nSteller sea lions are characterized by their large size, with adult males reaching up to 11 feet (3.3 meters) in length and weighing up to 2,500 pounds (1,130 kilograms). They have a tawny-colored coat and a distinct, lion-like mane around their head and neck, which gives them their distinctive appearance.\n\nThese sea lions are known for their social behavior, with individuals often congregating in large rookeries for breeding and resting. They are primarily piscivorous, feeding on a variety of fish species, as well as some invertebrates and smaller marine mammals.\n\nThe Steller sea lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to a decline in population numbers over the past several decades, primarily due to factors such as overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change.",
