  "description": "Marmot norovirus is a type of virus that infects marmots, a type of large ground squirrel found in mountainous regions. Noroviruses are a group of highly contagious viruses that can cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and other animals.\n\nThe marmot norovirus is a member of the Caliciviridae family and is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. Like other noroviruses, it is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, either by direct contact with infected individuals or by consuming contaminated food or water.\n\nInfection with marmot norovirus can lead to symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain in marmots. The virus can also be shed asymptomatically, allowing for the potential spread to other marmots or even to humans who may come into contact with infected marmots or their environments.\n\nResearch on marmot norovirus is limited, but it is an important area of study to understand the ecology and epidemiology of this virus, as well as its potential impact on marmot populations and any potential zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission.",
