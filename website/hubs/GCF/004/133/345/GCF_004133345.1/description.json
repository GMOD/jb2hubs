  "description": "Human papillomavirus type 203 (HPV203) is a member of the Papillomaviridae family, which are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect the epithelial cells of various vertebrates, including humans. HPV203 is a newly identified type of human papillomavirus, classified within the genus Alphapapillomavirus.\n\nHPV203 is primarily associated with cutaneous lesions, such as warts or papillomas, on the skin of infected individuals. It is considered a low-risk HPV type, meaning it is less likely to progress to precancerous or cancerous lesions compared to high-risk HPV types that are commonly associated with cervical, anal, and other genital cancers.\n\nThe genome of HPV203 contains the typical genetic organization of papillomaviruses, including the early (E) and late (L) genes responsible for viral replication, transcription, and capsid protein production. As a newly discovered HPV type, the specific epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical significance of HPV203 are still under investigation and require further research to fully understand its role in human health and disease.",
