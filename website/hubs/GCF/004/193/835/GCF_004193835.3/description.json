  "description": "Ostrinia furnacalis, commonly known as the Asian corn borer, is a species of moth in the family Crambidae. It is a significant agricultural pest, primarily affecting corn (maize) crops across Asia.\n\nThe Asian corn borer is a small moth with a wingspan of around 20-30 millimeters. The adult moths have brownish-gray wings with dark spots and markings. The larvae, or caterpillars, are typically yellowish-white in color with a brown head and can reach up to 20 millimeters in length.\n\nThe life cycle of Ostrinia furnacalis involves several generations per year, with the larvae burrowing into the stems and ears of corn plants, feeding on the plant tissues and causing significant damage to the crop. The larvae can also attack other cereal crops, such as sorghum and millet.\n\nThe species is widely distributed throughout Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and parts of Southeast Asia, where it is considered a major pest for corn production. Effective management strategies often involve a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods to minimize the impact of the Asian corn borer on agricultural yields.",
