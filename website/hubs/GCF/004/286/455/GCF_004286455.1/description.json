  "description": "Anelloviridae is a family of small, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. The members of this family are collectively referred to as anelloviruses.\n\nAnelloviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a circular, covalently closed, single-stranded DNA genome of approximately 2-4 kilobases in size. The genome typically encodes a few proteins, including a replication-associated protein and a capsid protein.\n\nAnelloviruses are widely distributed in the human population, with high prevalence rates detected in both healthy individuals and those with various clinical conditions. However, their exact role in human health and disease remains a subject of ongoing research and debate.\n\nThe Anelloviridae family includes several genera, such as Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus, and Gammatorquevirus, which are distinguished by their genomic and phylogenetic characteristics. Anelloviruses are believed to have co-evolved with their hosts over a long period, and their presence in the human population is thought to be a result of this long-term host-virus relationship.",
