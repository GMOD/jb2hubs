  "description": "Vitis riparia, commonly known as the riverbank grape or frost grape, is a species of wild grape native to North America. It is a deciduous, woody vine that typically grows along riverbanks, forest edges, and other moist, well-drained habitats.\n\nThe leaves of Vitis riparia are typically lobed, with three to five lobes, and are dark green in color. The vines can grow up to 30 meters (100 feet) in length and have tendrils that allow them to climb and spread over various structures.\n\nThe flowers of Vitis riparia are small, greenish-yellow, and arranged in clusters. The fruits are small, round, and dark blue or purple in color when ripe, and are often used for making jams, jellies, and wine.\n\nVitis riparia is known for its tolerance to cold temperatures and its ability to withstand frost, which allows it to thrive in regions with colder climates. It is also an important species in the cultivation of grape hybrids, as it is resistant to certain diseases and pests that can affect cultivated grape varieties.",
