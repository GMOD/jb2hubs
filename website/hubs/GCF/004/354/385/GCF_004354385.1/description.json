  "description": "Drosophila innubila is a species of fruit fly belonging to the genus Drosophila. It is a small, winged insect that is commonly used as a model organism in genetic and developmental biology research.\n\nSome key scientific characteristics of Drosophila innubila include:\n\n1. Taxonomy: Drosophila innubila is classified under the family Drosophilidae, which comprises over 4,000 species of fruit flies.\n\n2. Morphology: The adult Drosophila innubila is typically less than 5 millimeters in length, with a slender body and two membranous wings. The flies exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males and females displaying distinct physical features.\n\n3. Habitat and Distribution: Drosophila innubila is found in various regions across North America, including the western United States and Canada. The species is commonly associated with rotting plant matter, such as decaying fruit, as a source of food and breeding ground.\n\n4. Life Cycle: Like other Drosophila species, Drosophila innubila undergoes a complete metamorphosis, with distinct egg, larval, pupal, and adult stages. The life cycle is relatively short, with the entire development from egg to adult occurring within a few weeks under optimal conditions.\n\n5. Genetic Model: Drosophila innubila, along with other Drosophila species, has been extensively studied as a model organism in genetic and developmental biology research. The species' small size, short life cycle, and well-characterized genome make it a valuable tool for understanding fundamental biological processes.\n\nOverall, Drosophila innubila is a small, winged insect that has been widely used in scientific research due to its unique characteristics and suitability as a model organism.",
