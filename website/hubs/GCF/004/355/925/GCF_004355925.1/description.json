  "description": "Anarrhichthys ocellatus, commonly known as the wolf-eel, is a species of marine fish belonging to the Anarrhichthyidae family. It is found in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, ranging from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.\n\nThe wolf-eel is a bottom-dwelling fish that can grow up to 2.1 meters (7 feet) in length. It has a long, eel-like body with a large, blunt head and a prominent lower jaw. The fish's body is covered in small, scale-like structures and its coloration varies from reddish-brown to grayish-brown, often with dark blotches or spots.\n\nWolf-eels are known for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, which they use to crush the shells of crustaceans and mollusks, their primary prey. They are also capable of producing a low-frequency grunting sound, which is believed to be used for communication and territorial defense.\n\nWolf-eels are typically found in rocky, kelp-covered habitats at depths ranging from 3 to 91 meters (10 to 300 feet). They are relatively long-lived, with some individuals living up to 30 years. While not considered threatened, wolf-eels are subject to various environmental pressures, including habitat degradation and commercial fishing.",
