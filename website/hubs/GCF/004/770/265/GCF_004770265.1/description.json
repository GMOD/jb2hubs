  "description": "Leptospira congkakensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Leptospira. Leptospira are spiral-shaped, motile bacteria that are classified as spirochetes. The species Leptospira congkakensis was first isolated from environmental samples collected in Congkak, Malaysia.\n\nLeptospira congkakensis is considered a pathogenic species, meaning it can cause disease in humans and animals. The bacteria are typically transmitted through contact with contaminated water, soil, or the urine of infected animals. Infection with Leptospira congkakensis can lead to a range of symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle pain, and in severe cases, liver and kidney damage.\n\nGenetically, Leptospira congkakensis is closely related to other pathogenic Leptospira species, sharing similarities in their genome and genomic organization. Further research is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology, virulence factors, and potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets associated with this species.",
