  "description": "Tulane virus is a member of the Caliciviridae family, which is a group of small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. The Tulane virus was first isolated in 2009 from stool samples of rhesus macaques at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, United States.\n\nStructurally, the Tulane virus has an icosahedral capsid that is approximately 35-40 nanometers in diameter. The viral genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of the viral structural and non-structural proteins.\n\nThe Tulane virus is closely related to other caliciviruses, such as the Norovirus and Sapovirus, which are known to cause gastroenteritis in humans. However, the Tulane virus has not been definitively linked to any known human disease, and its potential for zoonotic transmission and pathogenicity in humans remains an area of ongoing research.\n\nOverall, the Tulane virus is an important subject of study in the field of viral ecology and evolution, as it provides insights into the diversity and adaptability of caliciviruses and their potential interactions with their host species.",
