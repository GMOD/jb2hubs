  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known species called \"Turkey calicivirus.\" Caliciviruses are a family of non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that can infect a variety of hosts, including humans, animals, and some marine organisms. However, there is no specific calicivirus that is commonly referred to as the \"Turkey calicivirus.\"\n\nCaliciviruses can cause various diseases in their respective hosts, such as gastroenteritis in humans (e.g., norovirus), and may also be associated with respiratory or neurological symptoms in some animals. However, without more specific information about the virus in question, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Caliciviruses are an important group of viruses, but the term \"Turkey calicivirus\" does not refer to an established or recognized viral species.",
