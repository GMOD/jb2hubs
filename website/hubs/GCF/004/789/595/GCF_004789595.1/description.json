  "description": "Ilesha virus is a member of the Alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Ilesha virus was first isolated in 1964 from a mosquito species (Mansonia africana) collected in Ilesha, Nigeria.\n\nThe virus primarily circulates in Africa, and it is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes. Ilesha virus can cause an acute febrile illness in humans, with symptoms including fever, headache, myalgia, and rash. However, most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild, self-limiting illness.\n\nLimited information is available about the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of Ilesha virus infections in humans. Further research is needed to better understand the ecology, transmission dynamics, and public health significance of this relatively obscure arboviral pathogen.",
