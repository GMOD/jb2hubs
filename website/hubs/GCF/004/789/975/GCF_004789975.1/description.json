  "description": "The Fort Sherman virus is a type of virus that belongs to the Pegivirus genus within the Flaviviridae family. It was first isolated from ticks collected in Fort Sherman, Panama, in the 1970s. The Fort Sherman virus is considered a tick-borne virus, meaning it is primarily transmitted by ticks to various animal hosts, including humans.\n\nThe Fort Sherman virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which means that its genetic material is in the form of RNA, and it can be directly translated into viral proteins by the host's cellular machinery. The virus is believed to have a relatively broad host range, having been detected in various vertebrate species, such as rodents and birds, as well as in ticks.\n\nThe exact pathogenic potential of the Fort Sherman virus in humans is not fully understood, as there have been limited reports of human infections. However, some studies suggest that it may cause mild or asymptomatic infections in humans, similar to other Pegiviruses. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and public health significance of the Fort Sherman virus.",
