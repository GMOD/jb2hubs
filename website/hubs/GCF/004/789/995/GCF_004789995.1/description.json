  "description": "Cache Valley virus (CVV) is a mosquito-borne Bunyavirus that belongs to the Orthobunyavirus genus. It is primarily found in North America and is maintained in a natural cycle between mosquitoes and various wild mammals, such as deer, sheep, and cattle.\n\nCVV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. The virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, primarily those in the Aedes and Culex genera, during blood-feeding. In humans, CVV can cause a febrile illness with symptoms that may include headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild, self-limiting illness.\n\nThe virus is considered an emerging arboviral pathogen, and its potential for causing more severe disease in humans is an area of ongoing research. Understanding the ecology, transmission dynamics, and public health impact of CVV is important for monitoring and preventing its spread, particularly in regions where it is endemic.",
