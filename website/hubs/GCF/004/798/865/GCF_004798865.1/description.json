  "description": "Varanus komodoensis, commonly known as the Komodo dragon, is the largest living species of lizard on Earth. It is a member of the monitor lizard family, Varanidae, and is endemic to the islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang in Indonesia.\n\nThe Komodo dragon is a large, robust lizard with a muscular, flattened body and a long, powerful tail. It can grow up to 3 meters (10 feet) in length and weigh up to 70 kilograms (150 pounds). The Komodo dragon's skin is covered in small, overlapping scales that are typically dark brown or gray in color, with some individuals displaying patterns of yellow, white, or orange.\n\nThese formidable predators are known for their ability to hunt and kill large prey, including deer, wild boar, and even water buffalo. They use a combination of their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and venomous saliva to subdue their prey. The Komodo dragon's venom contains anticoagulant properties that can cause the prey to bleed out, making it easier for the lizard to consume.\n\nKomodo dragons are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are often found basking in the sun or near warm, volcanic areas. These lizards are also known for their impressive olfactory capabilities, using their forked tongues to detect the scent of potential prey.\n\nKomodo dragons are classified as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss and hunting pressures. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of national parks and strict regulations on the trade of these animals, are crucial for the long-term survival of this iconic reptile.",
