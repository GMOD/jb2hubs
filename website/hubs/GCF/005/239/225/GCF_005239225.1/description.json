  "description": "Populus alba, commonly known as the white poplar or silver poplar, is a deciduous tree species that belongs to the genus Populus, which is part of the willow family (Salicaceae). It is native to Europe, western and central Asia, and North Africa.\n\nThe white poplar is a medium to large-sized tree, typically reaching heights of 20-30 meters (65-100 feet) and a trunk diameter of up to 1.5 meters (5 feet). Its distinctive feature is the white, woolly-pubescent leaves, which are green on the upper surface and white on the lower surface, giving the tree a silvery appearance, especially when the leaves are blown by the wind.\n\nThe tree's bark is smooth and pale gray when young, becoming fissured and darker as it matures. The leaves are simple, alternate, and broadly ovate to nearly round in shape, with a serrated margin. The flowers are small, dioecious catkins that appear before the leaves in early spring.\n\nPopulus alba is known for its fast growth, adaptability to a wide range of soil types, and tolerance to urban pollution and environmental stresses. It is commonly used as an ornamental and shade tree, as well as for its timber, which is used in various wood-based industries. The tree also plays an important ecological role, providing habitat and food sources for various wildlife species.",
