  "description": "Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms, including humans. It is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae and is one of the most studied and well-known bacterial species.\n\nE. coli is a facultative anaerobe, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It is typically a commensal organism, living in the intestinal tract of its host without causing any harm. However, certain strains of E. coli can be pathogenic, causing a range of diseases, such as gastroenteritis, urinary tract infections, and even life-threatening conditions like hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome.\n\nThe genome of E. coli is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that contains approximately 4.6 million base pairs. It has a diverse metabolic capability, allowing it to thrive in a variety of environments and utilize a wide range of carbon and energy sources.\n\nE. coli is widely used as a model organism in microbiology, genetics, and molecular biology research due to its well-understood genetics, rapid growth, and ease of manipulation. It has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of fundamental cellular processes, gene regulation, and the development of recombinant DNA technology.",
