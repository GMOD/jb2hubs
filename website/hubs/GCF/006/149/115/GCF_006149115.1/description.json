  "description": "Oncorhynchus nerka, commonly known as the sockeye salmon or red salmon, is a species of anadromous fish belonging to the genus Oncorhynchus. It is native to the northern Pacific Ocean and the rivers of western North America, ranging from the Yukon River in Alaska to the Sacramento River in California.\n\nSockeye salmon are known for their vibrant red bodies and green heads during their spawning phase, which occurs in freshwater streams and lakes. They spend the majority of their lives in the ocean, feeding on small crustaceans and plankton, before returning to their natal streams to spawn and then die.\n\nThese fish are an important resource for both commercial and recreational fisheries, as well as for indigenous communities in the Pacific Northwest. They are also a keystone species in many aquatic ecosystems, providing a vital source of nutrients and energy to the surrounding environment.\n\nSockeye salmon have a complex life cycle, with multiple stages of development and migration patterns. They are well-adapted to their cold-water environments and have evolved various strategies to overcome the challenges of their migratory lifestyle.",
