  "description": "Mammalian orthoreovirus 3 Dearing is a strain of the Mammalian orthoreovirus species, which belongs to the Reoviridae family. It is a non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects mammals, including humans.\n\nThe Mammalian orthoreovirus 3 Dearing strain is classified as a serotype 3 virus within the Mammalian orthoreovirus genus. It is a segmented genome virus, with 10 distinct double-stranded RNA segments that encode various viral proteins involved in replication, assembly, and host interactions.\n\nThis virus is known to cause a range of clinical symptoms in infected hosts, including gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, and central nervous system complications. It is believed to be transmitted through the fecal-oral route or respiratory droplets, and can be found in various animal reservoirs, including rodents and livestock.\n\nMammalian orthoreovirus 3 Dearing has been studied extensively as a model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus-host interactions and the pathogenesis of reovirus infections. It has also been investigated for its potential use in oncolytic therapy, where the virus's ability to selectively target and lyse certain cancer cells is being explored.",
