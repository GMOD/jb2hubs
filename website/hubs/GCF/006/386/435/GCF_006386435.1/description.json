  "description": "Epinephelus moara, commonly known as the Malabar grouper, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Serranidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, primarily in coastal waters around the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and parts of East Asia.\n\nThe Malabar grouper is a large, predatory fish that can reach lengths up to 100 cm. It has a robust, elongated body with a large, terminal mouth and prominent canine-like teeth. The fish's coloration is typically a reddish-brown or greyish-brown, with dark saddle-like markings along the back and sides.\n\nEpinephelus moara is an important commercial and recreational species, known for its excellent taste and texture. It inhabits coral reefs, rocky areas, and seagrass beds, where it primarily feeds on a variety of smaller fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nThe Malabar grouper is a protogynous hermaphrodite, meaning that it starts life as a female and can later transition to a male. It is a long-lived species, with individuals capable of reaching ages of over 30 years.\n\nDue to its popularity as a food fish and concerns over overfishing, the Malabar grouper is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Conservation efforts and sustainable management practices are essential for the long-term survival of this ecologically and economically important species.",
