  "description": "Akhmeta virus is a newly discovered virus that belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Peribunyaviridae. It was first isolated from ticks collected in Akhmeta, Georgia in 2015.\n\nThe Akhmeta virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome consists of three segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L) segments. The S segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the M segment encodes the glycoprotein precursor, and the L segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that the Akhmeta virus is closely related to other orthobunyaviruses, such as the Tete virus and the Ilesha virus, which are known to be transmitted by ticks. However, the specific vector and natural reservoir of the Akhmeta virus are still under investigation.\n\nLimited data is available on the pathogenicity and clinical manifestations associated with Akhmeta virus infection in humans or animals. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and potential impact of this newly discovered virus.",
