  "description": "Norovirus GII/Hu/JP/2007/GII.P15_GII.15/Sapporo/HK299 is a strain of norovirus that belongs to the genogroup II (GII) classification. Noroviruses are a group of highly contagious RNA viruses that are a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. \n\nThis specific strain was isolated in Japan in 2007 and is characterized by the genetic makeup of its polymerase (GII.P15) and capsid (GII.15) regions. The \"Hu\" designation indicates that it was isolated from a human host, and the \"Sapporo/HK299\" refers to the location and sample name where the virus was identified.\n\nNoroviruses like this strain can spread rapidly through contaminated food or water, as well as person-to-person contact. They typically cause symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in infected individuals. Norovirus infections are a significant public health concern due to their ability to cause outbreaks in various settings, including healthcare facilities, schools, and cruise ships.",
