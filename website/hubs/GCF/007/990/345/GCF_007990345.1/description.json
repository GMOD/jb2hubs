  "description": "Gossypium hirsutum, commonly known as upland cotton, is a species of cotton plant that is widely cultivated for its valuable fiber. It is a perennial shrub or small tree that can grow up to 2 meters in height.\n\nThe plant has large, lobed leaves that are typically green in color. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive red center, and are followed by the development of the cotton bolls. These bolls contain the cotton fibers, which are composed of long, unicellular trichomes (hair-like structures) that arise from the outer layer of the seed.\n\nGossypium hirsutum is native to Central America and Mexico, but it has been extensively cultivated and naturalized in many other parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is a commercially important crop, as the cotton fibers are used in the production of a wide range of textile products, including clothing, bedding, and industrial materials.\n\nThe species is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions, including tolerance to drought and pests. It has been the subject of extensive breeding and genetic research to improve its agronomic and fiber quality characteristics, making it a valuable resource for the global textile industry.",
