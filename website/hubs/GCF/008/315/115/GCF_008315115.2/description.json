  "description": "Sander lucioperca, commonly known as the zander or European pikeperch, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Percidae. It is a predatory fish native to parts of Europe and Asia, including regions such as the Caspian Sea, Black Sea, and the major river basins of Eastern Europe.\n\nThe zander is a sleek, elongated fish with a large, prominent mouth and sharp teeth. It typically ranges in length from 40 to 80 cm (16 to 31 inches) and can weigh up to 12 kg (26 pounds). The body color is generally olive-green or brownish-green on the back, with silvery-white sides and a white or yellowish belly.\n\nZanders are known for their excellent eyesight and ability to ambush their prey, which includes a variety of smaller fish, as well as crustaceans and amphibians. They are an important recreational and commercial species, valued for their firm, white flesh and delicate flavor.\n\nDue to their popularity, zanders have been introduced to various water bodies outside their native range, where they can sometimes become an invasive species, posing a threat to native fish communities. Conservation efforts are in place in some regions to manage and sustain healthy zander populations.",
