  "description": "Norovirus GI, also known as Norwalk-like virus, is a member of the Caliciviridae family of viruses. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that is responsible for causing acute gastroenteritis in humans.\n\nThe Norovirus GI genome is approximately 7.5 kilobases in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is cleaved into several non-structural proteins involved in viral replication, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and minor capsid proteins, respectively.\n\nNorovirus GI is highly infectious and can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, as well as through direct contact with infected individuals or surfaces. The virus is also known for its ability to evolve rapidly, leading to the emergence of new variants that can evade host immunity and cause outbreaks.\n\nSymptoms of Norovirus GI infection typically include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, and the illness is usually self-limiting, lasting for a few days. However, in some cases, particularly in the elderly or immunocompromised individuals, the infection can lead to more severe complications, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nEffective prevention and control of Norovirus GI outbreaks rely on proper hygiene, sanitation, and food safety practices, as well as the development of effective vaccines and antiviral therapies.",
