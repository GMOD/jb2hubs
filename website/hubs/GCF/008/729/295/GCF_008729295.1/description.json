  "description": "Plectropomus leopardus, commonly known as the coral trout or leopard coral grouper, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Serranidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the central Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe coral trout is a medium-sized fish, typically growing up to 60 cm in length. It has a robust, elongated body with a large, terminal mouth and a distinct head profile. The species is characterized by its distinctive coloration, which features a light brown or yellowish-brown background with dark brown or black spots and blotches, resembling the pattern of a leopard's coat.\n\nCoral trouts are carnivorous predators, feeding primarily on smaller fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. They inhabit shallow to moderately deep coral reef environments, often found in association with healthy, diverse coral communities. The species plays an important ecological role in regulating the populations of their prey, contributing to the overall balance and resilience of coral reef ecosystems.\n\nPlectropomus leopardus is of significant commercial and recreational importance, being targeted by commercial and artisanal fisheries in many regions. The species is also valued in the aquarium trade. Due to its susceptibility to overfishing and the threats posed by habitat degradation, the coral trout is classified as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
