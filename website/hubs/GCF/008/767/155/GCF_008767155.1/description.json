  "description": "Feline calicivirus is a small, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Caliciviridae family. It is one of the primary causative agents of upper respiratory tract infections in domestic cats and other feline species.\n\nThe virion is approximately 27-40 nanometers in diameter and has a characteristic cup-shaped (caliciform) appearance under electron microscopy. The viral genome is approximately 7.7 kilobases in length and encodes several structural and non-structural proteins essential for the virus's replication and assembly.\n\nFeline calicivirus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or exposure to contaminated surfaces, secretions, or aerosols. The virus primarily targets the upper respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge, oral ulceration, and fever. In some cases, it can also lead to more severe manifestations, including pneumonia and sepsis.\n\nThe virus is known for its genetic diversity, with multiple strains and variants circulating among feline populations. This diversity can pose challenges in terms of vaccine development and the effective control of feline calicivirus infections in veterinary settings.",
