  "description": "Sapovirus Hu/GI/Sapporo/MT-2010/1982 is a species of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Sapovirus genus within the Caliciviridae family. It is a member of the Sapporo-like viruses, which are known to cause acute gastroenteritis in humans.\n\nThe Sapovirus Hu/GI/Sapporo/MT-2010/1982 strain was first identified in 1982 in Sapporo, Japan, and is classified within the Genogroup I (GI) of the Sapovirus genus. The virus is approximately 30-35 nanometers in diameter and has a non-enveloped, icosahedral capsid structure.\n\nThe viral genome is approximately 7.3-7.5 kilobases in length and contains three open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes the viral non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, while ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major and minor structural proteins, respectively.\n\nSapovirus Hu/GI/Sapporo/MT-2010/1982 is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and it can cause acute gastroenteritis with symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. The virus is known to be relatively stable in the environment and can be resistant to certain disinfection methods, which can contribute to its ability to cause outbreaks in various settings.",
