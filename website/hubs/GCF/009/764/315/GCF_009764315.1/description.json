It is a member of the family Cercopithecidae and the genus Trachypithecus.\n\nThe Francois' langur is a medium-sized primate, with adults typically weighing between 10 to 15 kilograms. It has a distinctive physical appearance, with a long, black body and limbs, and a white or pale-colored head and neck. The species is known for its unique social structure, living in multi-male, multi-female groups that exhibit a complex hierarchy.\n\nTrachypithecus francoisi is an arboreal species, spending most of its time in the canopy of tropical and subtropical forests. It is primarily folivorous, feeding on a variety of leaves, shoots, and fruits. The species is considered threatened due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nConservation efforts are ongoing to protect the Francois' langur, with a focus on habitat preservation, anti-poaching measures, and captive breeding programs. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and its survival is crucial for the maintenance of the unique biodiversity found in the forests of southern China and northern Vietnam.",
