  "description": "Lacerta agilis, commonly known as the sand lizard, is a species of lizard belonging to the family Lacertidae. It is a small to medium-sized lizard, typically measuring between 15 to 25 centimeters in length, with a slender body and a pointed snout.\n\nThe sand lizard is native to Europe, with a distribution ranging from the United Kingdom in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. It primarily inhabits dry, sandy, or rocky habitats, such as heathlands, open woodlands, and coastal dunes.\n\nThe species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with males typically having a more vibrant coloration, often with a greenish or brownish hue, while females tend to be more drab in appearance. The sand lizard's diet consists mainly of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and small snails.\n\nLacerta agilis is ectothermic, meaning it relies on external sources of heat to regulate its body temperature. It is known for its ability to rapidly retreat into burrows or crevices when threatened, and it can also shed its tail as a defense mechanism.\n\nThe sand lizard is considered a protected species in some regions due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and it is an important component of the local ecosystem, serving as a prey item for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of its habitat.",
