  "description": "Catharus ustulatus, commonly known as the Swainson's Thrush, is a small passerine bird that belongs to the family Turdidae. This species is native to North America, breeding across western and central Canada and the western United States, and wintering in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America.\n\nThe Swainson's Thrush is characterized by its olive-brown upper parts, buffy underparts with dark spots, and a distinctive eye-ring. Its song is a beautiful, flutelike series of whistled notes, often described as \"oh-ee-oh-ee-oh.\" This species is known for its complex migratory behavior, undertaking long-distance, nocturnal migrations between its breeding and wintering grounds.\n\nEcologically, the Swainson's Thrush plays an important role as a forest-dwelling insectivore, consuming a variety of insects, spiders, and small fruits. It serves as a key indicator species for the health of its forest habitats, and its population trends are closely monitored by ornithologists and conservation biologists.",
