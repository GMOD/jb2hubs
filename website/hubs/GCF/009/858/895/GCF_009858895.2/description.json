  "description": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease. It is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a genome size of approximately 30,000 base pairs. It has four main structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The S protein is responsible for the virus's ability to bind to and enter human cells by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.\n\nThe virus is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols, and it has a higher transmission rate compared to other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure.\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global pandemic, with significant public health and economic consequences. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the virus's biology, developing effective treatments, and implementing strategies to mitigate the spread of the disease.",
