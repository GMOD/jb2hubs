  "description": "Eremomyces bilateralis CBS 781.70 is a species of fungus classified within the Ascomycota phylum. It is a member of the Eremotheciaceae family and the Eremomyces genus.\n\nThe species was first isolated and described from soil samples collected in Australia. It is characterized by its ability to form septate hyphae and produce asymmetrical, bilaterally symmetric ascospores within asci. The ascospores are ellipsoidal in shape and lack any surface ornamentation.\n\nEremomyces bilateralis is considered a saprotrophic fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by decomposing organic matter in its environment. It is adapted to survive in arid or semi-arid soil habitats. Further studies on the physiology, ecology, and potential applications of this fungal species may provide additional insights into its role in terrestrial ecosystems.",
