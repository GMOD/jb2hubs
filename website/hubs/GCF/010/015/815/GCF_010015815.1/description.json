  "description": "Dothidotthia symphoricarpi CBS 119687 is a fungal species that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a plant pathogen that primarily infects the plant species Symphoricarpos, commonly known as snowberry or coralberry.\n\nThe species is characterized by its ability to form asexual spores (conidia) within pycnidia, which are flask-shaped fruiting bodies that develop on the host plant's tissues. The conidia are typically hyaline (colorless) and ellipsoid or fusiform in shape.\n\nDothidotthia symphoricarpi CBS 119687 is known to cause disease symptoms on the leaves, stems, and fruits of Symphoricarpos plants, leading to reduced growth and yield. The fungus can survive and overwinter in the host's plant debris, serving as a source of inoculum for subsequent growing seasons.\n\nThis species has been isolated and studied in the laboratory, with the CBS 119687 strain being an important reference culture for research and identification purposes. Further studies on the biology, ecology, and management strategies for this plant pathogen can contribute to our understanding of its impact on Symphoricarpos species and potential mitigation approaches.",
