  "description": "Neohortaea acidophila is a species of black yeast-like fungus that belongs to the order Herpotrichiellaceae within the phylum Ascomycota. This species is known for its ability to thrive in highly acidic environments, with an optimal growth pH range between 0.5 and 2.5.\n\nNeohortaea acidophila is characterized by its dark, melanized cell walls, which contribute to its distinctive black appearance. The fungus reproduces asexually through the formation of yeast-like cells or blastoconidia. It is typically found in acidic habitats, such as mine drainage, acid lakes, and industrial wastewater treatment systems, where it plays a role in the cycling of nutrients and the remediation of acidic environments.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation, as it has been shown to tolerate and grow in the presence of various heavy metals and other pollutants commonly found in acidic environments. Additionally, Neohortaea acidophila has been investigated for its ability to produce melanin, a pigment with potential industrial and biotechnological uses.",
