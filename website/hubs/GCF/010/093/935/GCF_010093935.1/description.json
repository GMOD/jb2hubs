  "description": "Zasmidium cellare ATCC 36951 is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a dematiaceous hyphomycete, meaning it produces dark-colored, septate hyphae and conidiophores.\n\nThis fungus is commonly found in cellar environments, where it can grow on the surfaces of wooden structures, walls, and other substrates. It is known to be one of the causative agents of \"cellar fungus\" or \"cellar rot,\" a type of fungal decay that can damage the structural integrity of buildings.\n\nZasmidium cellare ATCC 36951 reproduces asexually through the production of conidia, which are small, single-celled spores that can be easily dispersed through the air. The conidia are typically dark-colored and ellipsoidal or cylindrical in shape.\n\nThis species is of particular interest in the field of mycology due to its ability to thrive in low-light, high-moisture environments and its potential impact on the preservation of historical buildings and structures.",
