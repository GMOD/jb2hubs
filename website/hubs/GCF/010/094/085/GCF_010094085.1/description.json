  "description": "Westerdykella ornata is a species of filamentous fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a member of the family Sporormiaceae and is commonly known as an ascomycetous fungus.\n\nWesterdykella ornata is characterized by its dark-colored, septate hyphae that can form complex structures called conidiophores. These conidiophores bear numerous, dark-pigmented, ornate spores called conidia, which are the asexual reproductive structures of the fungus.\n\nThe conidia of Westerdykella ornata are distinctive, typically having a complex, warty or spiny surface ornamentation, which gives the species its specific epithet \"ornata.\" This ornate appearance helps to distinguish Westerdykella ornata from other related species within the genus.\n\nWesterdykella ornata is commonly found in soil, decomposing plant material, and other organic substrates. It plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter and is considered a saprobic fungus, meaning it derives its nutrients from dead or decaying organic matter.\n\nOverall, Westerdykella ornata is a filamentous, ascomycetous fungus that is characterized by its dark-colored, septate hyphae and distinctive, ornately-decorated asexual spores, which contribute to its ecological function in the decomposition of organic matter.",
