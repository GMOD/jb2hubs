  "description": "Amblyraja radiata, commonly known as the thorny skate or starry ray, is a species of skate that belongs to the family Rajidae. It is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean, primarily in the waters surrounding Greenland, Iceland, and northern Europe.\n\nThe thorny skate is a bottom-dwelling elasmobranch, characterized by a flattened, diamond-shaped body with a long, slender tail. Its upper surface is covered in small, sharp thorns, which give the species its distinctive appearance and common name. The thorns are believed to serve as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nAmblyraja radiata is known to feed on a variety of prey, including small bony fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It is an ovoviviparous species, meaning that the eggs hatch within the female's body, and the young are born live.\n\nThe thorny skate is an important component of the marine ecosystem, playing a role in the regulation of prey populations and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. It is also of commercial importance, with its meat and cartilage being used for various purposes.",
