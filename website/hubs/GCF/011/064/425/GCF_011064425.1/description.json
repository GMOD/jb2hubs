  "description": "Rattus rattus, commonly known as the black rat or ship rat, is a species of rodent that belongs to the genus Rattus. It is a small to medium-sized rodent, typically ranging from 12 to 18 inches in length, including the tail.\n\nThe black rat is characterized by its slender body, pointed snout, large ears, and long, scaly tail that is typically longer than its body. Its fur can range in color from black to brown or gray, with a lighter underside. The black rat is an excellent climber and is often found in urban and agricultural areas, where it can thrive in close proximity to humans.\n\nRattus rattus is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of plant and animal matter, including grains, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and even small animals. It is a prolific breeder, with females capable of producing several litters per year, each containing up to 12 offspring.\n\nThe black rat is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world and is known to be a vector for several diseases, including plague, typhus, and leptospirosis. Its presence can also pose a significant threat to agricultural crops and stored food supplies. As a result, it is often the target of extensive control and eradication efforts in many regions.",
