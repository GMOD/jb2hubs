  "description": "Tursiops truncatus, commonly known as the common bottlenose dolphin, is a species of oceanic dolphin. It is one of the most well-known and widely distributed species of dolphins, found in warm and temperate waters around the world.\n\nThe common bottlenose dolphin is a medium-sized dolphin, typically ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 meters in length and weighing between 150 to 650 kilograms. It has a robust, stocky body with a short, stubby beak and a rounded, bulbous forehead, which gives it its characteristic \"bottle-nosed\" appearance. The dorsal fin is tall and triangular, and the tail flukes are broad and crescent-shaped.\n\nTursiops truncatus is a highly intelligent and social species, living in complex social groups and exhibiting advanced communication and problem-solving abilities. They are opportunistic feeders, primarily consuming a variety of fish, squid, and crustaceans. The species is known for its acrobatic leaps and other impressive behaviors, which have made it a popular subject for research and captive displays.\n\nTursiops truncatus is classified as a species of \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a wide distribution and is relatively abundant in many regions. However, the species faces various threats, including bycatch in fishing operations, habitat degradation, and pollution, which require ongoing conservation efforts to ensure its long-term survival.",
