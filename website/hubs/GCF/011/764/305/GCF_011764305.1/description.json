  "description": "Mustela putorius furo, commonly known as the domestic ferret, is a subspecies of the European polecat (Mustela putorius). Ferrets are small, elongated carnivorous mammals that belong to the weasel family (Mustelidae).\n\nFerrets are typically light-colored, ranging from white to dark brown, with a distinctive mask-like facial pattern. They have a flexible, tubular body, short legs, and a long, slender neck. Ferrets are known for their high-energy, playful, and inquisitive nature, as well as their ability to climb and explore small spaces.\n\nDomesticated ferrets are typically kept as pets and are often used in medical research and pest control. They are known for their hunting instincts and ability to flush out small prey from burrows and other hiding places. Ferrets are obligate carnivores and require a diet rich in protein and fat to meet their high-energy needs.\n\nBehaviorally, ferrets are social animals and often live in groups. They are known for their unique vocalizations, including a distinct \"dooking\" sound, which is used to communicate with other ferrets. Ferrets have a relatively short lifespan, typically living for 5 to 10 years in captivity.",
