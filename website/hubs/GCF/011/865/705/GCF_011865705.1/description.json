  "description": "Megalopta genalis is a species of nocturnal sweat bee that is native to Central and South America. It is a member of the subfamily Halictinae, which includes many species of ground-nesting bees.\n\nMegalopta genalis is a relatively large sweat bee, measuring approximately 10-12 millimeters in length. It has a robust body and large compound eyes, which are adaptations that allow it to navigate and forage effectively in low-light conditions. The species exhibits pronounced sexual dimorphism, with females being larger and darker in coloration compared to the smaller, lighter-colored males.\n\nThese bees construct nests in the soil or rotting wood, and their colonies can consist of a single female or multiple individuals. They are solitary in nature, but some degree of social behavior has been observed, with individuals cooperating in nest construction and provisioning.\n\nMegalopta genalis is an important pollinator, playing a role in the maintenance of tropical forest ecosystems. Its nocturnal foraging behavior and adaptations to low-light conditions make it a unique and fascinating component of the local biodiversity.",
