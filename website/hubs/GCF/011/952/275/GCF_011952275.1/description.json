  "description": "Bombus vancouverensis nearcticus is a subspecies of bumblebee (Bombus) that is native to western North America. It is commonly known as the Vancouver bumblebee or the Nearctic bumblebee.\n\nBombus vancouverensis nearcticus is a medium-sized bumblebee, typically measuring between 12-18 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive black and yellow color pattern, with a black head, thorax, and abdomen, and bright yellow bands on the thorax and abdomen.\n\nThis subspecies is found in coastal regions of western North America, including British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. It is commonly observed in various habitats, such as meadows, gardens, and forested areas, where it plays an important role in pollinating a wide range of flowering plants.\n\nBombus vancouverensis nearcticus is an important pollinator, contributing to the maintenance of healthy ecosystems and the reproduction of many plant species. Like other bumblebees, it collects pollen and nectar from flowers, which it uses to feed its colony. The colony typically consists of a single queen and her worker bees, which cooperate to rear the next generation of bumblebees.\n\nOverall, Bombus vancouverensis nearcticus is a valuable and ecologically significant component of the regional biodiversity, contributing to the resilience and functioning of the natural environments it inhabits.",
