  "description": "Zerene cesonia, commonly known as the southern dogface butterfly, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Pieridae. This species is native to North and Central America, ranging from southern Canada to Central America.\n\nThe southern dogface butterfly is characterized by its distinctive wing pattern. The upper side of the wings is a bright yellow color, with a black border and a \"dogface\" pattern on the forewing, which resembles the profile of a dog's head. The hindwings have a subtle pattern of dark veins. The underside of the wings is a lighter yellow color.\n\nZerene cesonia undergoes a complete metamorphic life cycle, with egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult stages. The caterpillars feed on various legumes, such as clover and alfalfa, while the adults primarily feed on nectar from flowering plants.\n\nThis species is known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows, open fields, and disturbed areas. The southern dogface butterfly plays an important role in the ecosystem as a pollinator and a food source for other organisms.",
