  "description": "Rhopilema esculentum, commonly known as the edible jellyfish or white-spotted jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish belonging to the family Rhizostomatidae. It is found in the coastal waters of East Asia, particularly in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea.\n\nRhopilema esculentum is a large, bell-shaped jellyfish with a diameter that can reach up to 60 centimeters (24 inches). The bell is white or pale blue in color, with distinct white spots or markings on the surface. The jellyfish has numerous tentacles that can extend up to 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length. These tentacles are used for capturing prey, which typically includes small fish, crustaceans, and plankton.\n\nThe life cycle of Rhopilema esculentum involves a planktonic larval stage called a planula, which develops into a polyp that attaches to a substrate. The polyp then undergoes a process called strobilation, where it produces multiple free-swimming medusa stages, which eventually mature into the adult jellyfish form.\n\nRhopilema esculentum is considered a delicacy in East Asian cuisine, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, where it is often served as a salad or in various dishes. The jellyfish is harvested and processed for human consumption, making it an important commercial and economic resource in the region.",
