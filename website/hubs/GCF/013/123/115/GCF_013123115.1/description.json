  "description": "Colletes gigas is a species of bee belonging to the genus Colletes, commonly known as the giant colletes bee or giant cellophane bee. This species is found in parts of Europe, including Spain, Italy, and Greece.\n\nColletes gigas is a relatively large bee, with a body length ranging from 12 to 16 millimeters. It has a dark brown or black body, with dense, long, and pale yellowish-white pubescence (hair) covering the thorax and the base of the abdomen. The wings are transparent with dark-colored veins.\n\nThese bees are solitary, with each female constructing its own nest burrow in the soil, often in areas with sparse vegetation or bare ground. The nests typically consist of a main tunnel with several lateral brood cells, where the female lays her eggs and provisions each cell with a mixture of pollen and nectar to serve as food for the developing larvae.\n\nColletes gigas is considered a specialist pollinator, primarily foraging on plants in the Fabaceae (legume) family, such as various species of clover and alfalfa. These bees play an important role in the pollination of these plants, contributing to the maintenance of natural and agricultural ecosystems.\n\nDue to their specialized feeding and nesting requirements, Colletes gigas populations can be sensitive to habitat loss and changes in land-use practices. Conservation efforts focused on protecting suitable nesting sites and ensuring the availability of their preferred floral resources may be important for the long-term preservation of this species.",
