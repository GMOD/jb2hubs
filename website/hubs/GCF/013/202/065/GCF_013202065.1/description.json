  "description": "Cotesia typhae is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is a solitary endoparasitoid, meaning that the adult female wasp lays its eggs inside the body of a host insect, and the developing wasp larva feeds on the internal tissues of the host, eventually killing it.\n\nThe host of Cotesia typhae is the larvae of the reed moth (Archanara typhae), which feeds on common reed (Phragmites australis) plants. The female wasp locates the host larvae, typically in the stems or leaves of the reed plants, and injects its eggs into the host's body using its ovipositor.\n\nOnce the wasp eggs hatch, the larvae begin to feed on the host's internal tissues, gradually consuming it from the inside. When the wasp larvae have completed their development, they emerge from the host's body, spin cocoons, and eventually metamorphose into adult wasps.\n\nCotesia typhae plays an important ecological role in regulating the populations of its host, the reed moth larvae, which can be considered agricultural pests in some regions where Phragmites is an important plant. The wasp's parasitism helps to maintain a balance between the host and its host plant, contributing to the overall ecosystem stability.",
