  "description": "Oncorhynchus mykiss, commonly known as the rainbow trout, is a species of salmonid fish native to the cold, clear waters of western North America. It is a member of the genus Oncorhynchus, which includes other Pacific salmon and trout species.\n\nOncorhynchus mykiss is characterized by its distinct iridescent coloration, with a silvery-green back, pink or reddish sides, and a white belly. The fish typically displays vibrant, multicolored lateral bands along its body, which can vary in intensity and pattern. Rainbow trout are known for their strong, athletic build and their ability to leap out of the water when hooked.\n\nThese fish are typically found in rivers, streams, and lakes, preferring cool, well-oxygenated waters with gravel or rocky substrates for spawning. They are opportunistic feeders, consuming a variety of aquatic insects, crustaceans, small fish, and other prey. Oncorhynchus mykiss is an important recreational and commercial species, widely cultivated in hatcheries and stocked in many freshwater systems worldwide for anglers and aquaculture.",
