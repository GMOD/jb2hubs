  "description": "Chelonus insularis is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is found on various islands in the Caribbean region, including Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.\n\nChelonus insularis is a small wasp, typically measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length. It has a black or dark brown body coloration, with a distinctive head and thorax structure characteristic of the Chelonus genus. The wasp's antennae are relatively long, and its wings are fully developed, allowing it to fly.\n\nAs a parasitoid, the female Chelonus insularis wasp lays its eggs inside the eggs or larvae of other insect species, usually lepidopteran (moth and butterfly) pests. The wasp's larvae then develop by feeding on the host insect, eventually emerging as adult wasps and leaving the host dead or severely weakened.\n\nChelonus insularis plays a role in the natural biological control of certain agricultural pests in the Caribbean region, making it a potentially valuable species for integrated pest management strategies. Its host-specific nature and relatively small size make it a less likely candidate for causing any significant harm to humans or other larger organisms.",
