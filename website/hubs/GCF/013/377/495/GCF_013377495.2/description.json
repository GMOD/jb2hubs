  "description": "Cygnus atratus, commonly known as the black swan, is a species of large waterfowl native to Australia. It belongs to the genus Cygnus, which includes several species of swans.\n\nThe black swan is characterized by its distinctive black plumage, with the exception of the white flight feathers on its wings, which are visible in flight. Its bill is bright red, and its eyes are reddish-brown. The black swan is a large bird, with a wingspan that can reach up to 2.1 meters (6.9 feet).\n\nCygnus atratus is primarily found in the wetlands and estuaries of eastern and southwestern Australia, where it feeds on aquatic plants, seeds, and small invertebrates. The species is known for its social nature, often forming large flocks, and its graceful movements on the water.\n\nBreeding typically occurs between July and November, with the female laying a clutch of 4 to 8 eggs. Both the male and female participate in the incubation and care of the cygnets (young swans) once they hatch.\n\nThe black swan is a species of conservation concern, with populations threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and hunting in some regions. It is, however, a popular and iconic species in Australian culture and is protected in many areas.",
