The root extracts of the plant contain a variety of biologically active compounds, including triptolide, celastrol, and wilforlide, which have been the focus of extensive research.\n\nThe plant has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, nephritis, and certain types of cancer.
