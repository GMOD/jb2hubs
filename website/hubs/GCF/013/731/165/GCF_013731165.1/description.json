  "description": "Rhagoletis pomonella, commonly known as the apple maggot fly or apple fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly native to North America. It is a significant agricultural pest, primarily targeting apple orchards.\n\nThe adult R. pomonella fly is approximately 5-6 mm in length, with a distinctive black and white banded pattern on its wings. The larvae, or maggots, are yellowish-white in color and can reach up to 10 mm in length.\n\nThe life cycle of R. pomonella begins when adult females lay their eggs in the flesh of developing apples or other pome fruits. The larvae then hatch and burrow through the fruit, feeding on the pulp and leaving characteristic tunnels and discoloration. This damage can make the fruit unmarketable and significantly reduce crop yields.\n\nR. pomonella is known for its ability to adapt to new host plants, including various cultivars of apples, as well as other fruits such as hawthorns and cherries. This adaptability has allowed the species to expand its range and become a widespread pest in apple-growing regions across North America.\n\nEffective management of R. pomonella often involves an integrated approach, including the use of insecticides, cultural practices, and the release of biological control agents, such as parasitoid wasps that target the fly's larvae.",
