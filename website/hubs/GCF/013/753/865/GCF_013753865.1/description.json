  "description": "Acropora millepora, commonly known as the bushy coral or staghorn coral, is a species of stony coral found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is a member of the genus Acropora, which is one of the most diverse and abundant coral genera in tropical and subtropical reef ecosystems.\n\nAcropora millepora is a branching, arborescent coral that forms dense, bushy colonies. The branches are typically cylindrical, with a diameter ranging from 5 to 15 millimeters. The colonies can grow to a substantial size, reaching up to 2 meters in diameter.\n\nThe coral's polyps are small, typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter, and are arranged in a radial pattern along the branches. The polyps are responsible for the coral's growth and skeletal formation, as they secrete calcium carbonate to create the coral's hard, external skeleton.\n\nAcropora millepora is a zooxanthellate coral, meaning it hosts symbiotic, single-celled algae called zooxanthellae within its tissues. These algae provide the coral with a significant portion of its energy through photosynthesis, contributing to the coral's growth and survival.\n\nThe species is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region, found in tropical and subtropical reef environments, typically in shallow, well-lit waters. It is a significant contributor to the structural complexity and biodiversity of coral reef ecosystems, providing habitat and resources for a wide range of marine organisms.",
