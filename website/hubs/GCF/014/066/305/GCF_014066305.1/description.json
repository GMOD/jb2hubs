  "description": "Letharia columbiana, commonly known as the western lichen or the columbian horsehair lichen, is a species of epiphytic fruticose lichen found in western North America. It is a member of the Lethariaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive shrubby, pendulous growth habit.\n\nThe thallus of L. columbiana is typically yellow-green to golden-brown in color, and it forms long, slender, cylindrical branches that can hang down from tree branches or other substrates. These branches can reach lengths of up to 30 cm (11.8 inches) and are typically less than 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter.\n\nThe lichen reproduces both sexually, through the production of small, disc-shaped apothecia, and asexually, through the formation of soredia, which are tiny, powdery propagules that can be dispersed by wind or water.\n\nL. columbiana is an important component of forest ecosystems in the western United States and Canada, where it serves as a food source for various wildlife species and contributes to the overall biodiversity of the region. It is also used in traditional Native American medicinal and cultural practices.",
