  "description": "Vespula pensylvanica, commonly known as the western yellowjacket, is a species of social wasp native to western North America. It belongs to the genus Vespula, which includes several species of yellowjackets.\n\nThe western yellowjacket is a medium-sized wasp, typically measuring between 12-17 mm in length. It has a distinctive black and yellow striped pattern on its abdomen, which is a common characteristic of many yellowjacket species. The head and thorax are also primarily black in color.\n\nThese wasps are known for their social behavior, living in colonies that can range from a few hundred to several thousand individuals. The colonies are typically established in underground nests or in cavities in trees, buildings, or other structures.\n\nWestern yellowjackets are opportunistic foragers, feeding on a variety of foods, including nectar, fruits, and other insects. They are important pollinators and play a role in the ecosystem, but can also be considered pests due to their tendency to invade human spaces and their ability to sting in defense of their nest.\n\nLike other yellowjacket species, Vespula pensylvanica is capable of stinging multiple times and can be aggressive when their nest is threatened or when they feel their colony is under attack. Their stings can be painful and, in rare cases, may trigger allergic reactions in some individuals.",
