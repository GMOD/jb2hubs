  "description": "Passer montanus, commonly known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or simply the tree sparrow, is a small passerine bird species that belongs to the family Passeridae. It is a native of Eurasia, with a distribution range spanning from Western Europe to East Asia.\n\nThe Eurasian tree sparrow is a small, stocky bird with a distinctive chestnut-brown crown, black cheek patch, and greyish-brown plumage. It measures approximately 14-15 cm in length and has a wingspan of around 21-24 cm. The species is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including urban, rural, and natural environments.\n\nPasser montanus is primarily granivorous, feeding on a wide range of seeds, grains, and occasionally small insects. It is a social species and often forms flocks, particularly during the non-breeding season. The species is known for its use of tree cavities, nest boxes, and buildings for nesting, where it constructs a cup-shaped nest made of straw, grass, and feathers.\n\nThe Eurasian tree sparrow is considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to its large and stable population, as well as its ability to adapt to human-modified environments. However, local declines have been observed in some regions due to factors such as habitat loss and changes in agricultural practices.",
