  "description": "Sturnira hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduran yellow bat, is a species of bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. It is found in parts of Central America, including Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador.\n\nThe Honduran yellow bat is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of around 60-70 millimeters and a wingspan of approximately 300-350 millimeters. Its fur is typically yellowish-brown in color, and it has a distinct nose leaf (a fleshy projection on the nose) that is characteristic of many bat species in the family Phyllostomidae.\n\nThis species is primarily frugivorous, meaning it feeds primarily on fruits. It plays an important role in the ecosystem by helping to disperse the seeds of the fruits it consumes, contributing to the regeneration of plant communities.\n\nThe Honduran yellow bat is considered a relatively common species within its range, but its population status and trends are not well-documented. As with many bat species, it faces threats from habitat loss and degradation due to human activities such as deforestation and urbanization.",
