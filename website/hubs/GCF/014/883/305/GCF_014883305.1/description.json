  "description": "Soldado virus is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus, which belongs to the family Nairoviridae. It is a tick-borne virus that primarily infects small mammals, such as rodents, and is transmitted by ticks of the genus Hyalomma.\n\nThe Soldado virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Its genome consists of three segments, designated as small (S), medium (M), and large (L), which encode the nucleocapsid protein, glycoproteins, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively.\n\nThe virus is primarily found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Europe. Infection in humans can result in a febrile illness, often accompanied by headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms. In severe cases, Soldado virus infection can lead to hemorrhagic manifestations, similar to other tick-borne diseases.\n\nSerological surveys and molecular detection methods have been used to study the prevalence and distribution of Soldado virus in various regions. Further research is ongoing to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions for this emerging tick-borne virus.",
