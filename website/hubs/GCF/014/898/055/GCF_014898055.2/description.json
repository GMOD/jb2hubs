  "description": "Talpa occidentalis, commonly known as the Iberian mole, is a species of mole native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, fossorial mammal adapted to a subterranean lifestyle.\n\nThe Iberian mole has a cylindrical body, short and stocky limbs, and large, paddle-like front paws specialized for digging. Its fur is velvety and typically dark gray or black in color. The eyes and external ears are reduced, as they are not essential for its underground existence. \n\nThese moles are highly specialized for burrowing and navigating complex tunnel systems in search of their primary food sources, which include earthworms, insects, and other small invertebrates. They construct extensive networks of tunnels and create mounds on the surface, known as molehills, as they push the soil upwards.\n\nTalpa occidentalis is found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural areas, as long as the soil conditions are suitable for burrowing. The species plays an important role in the ecosystem, contributing to soil aeration and nutrient cycling.",
