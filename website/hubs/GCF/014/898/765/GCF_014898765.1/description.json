  "description": "Puma yagouaroundi, commonly known as the jaguarundi, is a small to medium-sized wild cat species native to the Americas. It is the sole member of the genus Herpailurus.\n\nThe jaguarundi is characterized by its slender, otter-like body, short legs, and a long, cylindrical tail. It has a small, rounded head and ears, and its coat can range in color from reddish-brown to grey or black. The jaguarundi is known for its ability to move swiftly and agilely through dense vegetation.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Central and South America, with a range extending from Texas in the United States to northern Argentina. Jaguarundis are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical and subtropical forests, savannas, and even semi-arid regions.\n\nJaguarundis are primarily solitary and nocturnal, hunting small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. They are excellent climbers and can also swim well. The jaguarundi is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but its populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation in some parts of its range.",
