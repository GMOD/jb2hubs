  "description": "Nematolebias whitei, commonly known as the White's annual killifish, is a small freshwater fish species belonging to the family Rivulidae. This species is native to temporary pools and swamps in southeastern Brazil.\n\nThe Nematolebias whitei is a small, slender fish with a characteristic elongated body shape. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 5-7 centimeters. The fish has a distinct sexual dimorphism, where the males display more vibrant coloration with shades of blue, green, and orange, while the females exhibit a more subdued, brownish-grey appearance.\n\nAs an annual killifish, Nematolebias whitei has a unique life cycle adapted to the ephemeral nature of its habitat. The fish lays its eggs in the mud, which can withstand the dry periods when the temporary pools dry up. When the rains return and the pools refill, the eggs hatch, and the fish rapidly mature and reproduce before the pools dry up again.\n\nThis species is considered an important model organism in the study of annual killifish biology and adaptations to extreme environmental conditions. Its ability to survive in temporary pools and its rapid life cycle make it a valuable research subject for understanding the evolutionary strategies of fish species living in unpredictable habitats.",
