  "description": "Rattus norvegicus, commonly known as the brown rat or Norway rat, is a species of rodent that belongs to the genus Rattus. It is one of the most widely distributed and successful mammalian species on Earth, found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nThe brown rat is a medium-sized rodent, typically weighing between 200 to 500 grams. It has a robust, stocky build with a blunt snout, small rounded ears, and a scaly, sparsely-haired tail that is slightly shorter than its body length. The fur of the brown rat is coarse and ranges in color from brown to gray, with a lighter underside.\n\nRattus norvegicus is an omnivorous species, feeding on a wide variety of plant and animal matter, including grains, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and even small invertebrates and vertebrates. They are highly adaptable and thrive in both urban and rural environments, often living in close proximity to human habitations.\n\nBrown rats are known for their high reproductive rate, with females capable of producing up to 12 litters per year, each containing 6 to 12 young. They are social animals and often live in large colonies, exhibiting complex social behaviors and communication methods.\n\nDue to their adaptability, population size, and potential to spread diseases, Rattus norvegicus is considered a significant pest species in many parts of the world, causing substantial economic and health-related issues. Understanding the biology and ecology of this species is essential for effective management and control strategies.",
