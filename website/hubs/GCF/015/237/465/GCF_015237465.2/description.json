  "description": "Chelonia mydas, commonly known as the green turtle, is a species of large sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae. It is one of the largest members of the order Testudines, with a typical carapace (upper shell) length of about 1 meter and a weight of around 150 kilograms.\n\nThe green turtle is characterized by its large, heart-shaped carapace, which is typically olive-green in color, and its large, rounded head. Its front flippers are long and paddle-like, which aids in its efficient swimming abilities. The green turtle is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of marine plants, such as seagrasses and algae, as well as small invertebrates.\n\nThese turtles are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters around the world, with major nesting sites located in the Caribbean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. They play a crucial role in the marine ecosystem, as they help to maintain the health of seagrass and coral reef habitats through their grazing activities.\n\nGreen turtles are classified as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to various threats, including habitat loss, bycatch in fishing operations, and illegal poaching for their meat and eggs. Conservation efforts, such as protected nesting sites and the reduction of bycatch, are essential to ensuring the long-term survival of this ecologically important species.",
