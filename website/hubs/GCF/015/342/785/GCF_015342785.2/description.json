  "description": "Lytechinus pictus, commonly known as the painted sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin that belongs to the family Toxopneustidae. This echinoderm is found in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, primarily along the coasts of California, Mexico, and Central America.\n\nThe Lytechinus pictus has a globular, roughly spherical test (shell) that can reach up to 10 cm in diameter. The test is covered with numerous short, slender spines that are typically yellow, orange, or reddish-brown in color, giving the urchin a distinctive \"painted\" appearance.\n\nThe species feeds primarily on algae, seagrasses, and other marine vegetation, using its tube feet and sharp, tooth-like structures called Aristotle's lantern to grasp and consume its food. Lytechinus pictus plays an important role in the marine ecosystem, contributing to the overall health and diversity of the coastal environments it inhabits.\n\nReproduction in Lytechinus pictus involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a complex metamorphosis before settling and developing into the adult urchin form.\n\nThe painted sea urchin is a common and widely distributed species, and it is not currently considered to be threatened or endangered.",
