  "description": "Leptopilina heterotoma is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Figitidae. It is a small, dark-colored wasp, typically measuring around 2-3 millimeters in length.\n\nLeptopilina heterotoma is known for its parasitic relationship with various species of Drosophila (fruit flies). The female wasp lays its eggs inside the larvae of the host Drosophila, and the wasp's offspring then develop inside the host, ultimately killing the Drosophila larva.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, and it is commonly found in habitats where Drosophila species are present, such as orchards, gardens, and forests.\n\nLeptopilina heterotoma is an important model organism in the study of host-parasite interactions, as its complex life cycle and intricate relationship with Drosophila have made it a valuable subject for research in evolutionary biology, ecology, and behavioral ecology.",
