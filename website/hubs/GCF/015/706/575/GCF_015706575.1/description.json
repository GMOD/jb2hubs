  "description": "Patiria miniata, commonly known as the bat star or sea bat, is a species of sea star that belongs to the family Asterinidae. It is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean, found along the western coast of North America, from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico.\n\nPatiria miniata is a small to medium-sized sea star, typically measuring between 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter. It has a distinctive five-armed, flattened body with a distinctive \"bat-like\" appearance, which is the source of its common name. The upper surface of the sea star is typically a reddish-orange or brownish-red color, while the underside is pale or white.\n\nThe species is known for its ability to regenerate lost arms, a characteristic common among sea stars. Patiria miniata is an omnivorous predator, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, algae, and detritus found in its coastal habitat. It plays an important role in the intertidal and subtidal ecosystems it inhabits, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of these marine environments.",
