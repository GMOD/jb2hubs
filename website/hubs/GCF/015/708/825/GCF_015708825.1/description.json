  "description": "Lethenteron reissneri, commonly known as the Sakhalin lamprey, is a species of lamprey found in the northern regions of the Pacific Ocean, including the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan. It is a member of the family Petromyzontidae, which includes various species of jawless, eel-like fish known as lampreys.\n\nThe Sakhalin lamprey is a small, parasitic species that typically measures between 20 to 35 centimeters in length. It has a slender, eel-like body and a characteristic round, sucker-like mouth, which it uses to attach to the skin of host fish and feed on their blood and bodily fluids.\n\nThis species is anadromous, meaning it spends part of its life cycle in the ocean and part in freshwater streams and rivers. The Sakhalin lamprey spawns in small, gravel-bottomed streams, where the larvae, known as ammocoetes, burrow into the sediment and filter-feed on detritus and algae for several years before undergoing a metamorphosis and migrating to the ocean.\n\nIn the ocean, the adult Sakhalin lamprey parasitizes various species of marine fish, including salmon, trout, and other large predatory fish. The lamprey's feeding activity can have a significant impact on the health and population dynamics of its host species.\n\nThe Sakhalin lamprey is widely distributed throughout its range and is not currently considered to be at risk of extinction. However, like many other lamprey species, it may face conservation challenges due to habitat degradation, barriers to migration, and other human-induced environmental changes.",
