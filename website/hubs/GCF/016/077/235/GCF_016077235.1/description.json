  "description": "Cyprinodon tularosa, commonly known as the White Sands pupfish, is a small freshwater fish species endemic to the Tularosa Basin in southern New Mexico, United States. It is a member of the Cyprinodontidae family, which includes several species of pupfish.\n\nThe White Sands pupfish is a small, laterally compressed fish that typically grows to a maximum length of about 5 centimeters (2 inches). It has a rounded snout, a small, terminal mouth, and large eyes. The fish's coloration varies, with males displaying iridescent blue and green hues during the breeding season, while females and non-breeding males are generally grayish-brown.\n\nThis species is adapted to the harsh, fluctuating environmental conditions of the Tularosa Basin, including high salinity, high temperatures, and low dissolved oxygen levels. The White Sands pupfish plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region.\n\nDue to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, the White Sands pupfish is classified as an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and is protected under the United States Endangered Species Act.",
