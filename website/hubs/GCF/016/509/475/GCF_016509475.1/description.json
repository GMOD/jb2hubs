  "description": "Prionailurus bengalensis, commonly known as the leopard cat, is a small wild cat species native to Asia. It is classified under the genus Prionailurus, which is part of the Felidae family.\n\nThe leopard cat is a medium-sized feline, typically weighing between 2-5 kg. It has a slender build, with a long body and relatively short legs. Its coat is typically golden-brown to reddish-brown in color, with dark spots or rosettes that are smaller and more numerous compared to the larger leopard. The tail is relatively long, accounting for about half the length of the body.\n\nLeopard cats are found in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and even agricultural areas, across Southeast Asia, East Asia, and parts of the Indian subcontinent. They are adept climbers and also swim well, primarily hunting small mammals, birds, and reptiles.\n\nThese cats are typically solitary and nocturnal, with a home range that can vary widely depending on the habitat and resource availability. They are generally considered to be less threatened compared to other wild cat species, but habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting for the pet trade, remain ongoing threats to their conservation.",
