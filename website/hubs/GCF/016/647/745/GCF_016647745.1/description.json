  "description": "Suillus plorans is a species of fungus in the family Suillaceae. It is a member of the genus Suillus, commonly known as the slippery jacks or suillus mushrooms.\n\nSuillus plorans is a mycorrhizal fungus, meaning it forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of certain tree species, typically pines (Pinus spp.). The fungus assists the tree in nutrient and water absorption, while the tree provides the fungus with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis.\n\nThe fruiting bodies of Suillus plorans are small to medium-sized, with a convex to flat cap that is typically yellow or olive-yellow in color. The cap surface is sticky or slimy when moist. The tubes (hymenophore) on the underside of the cap are decurrent, meaning they extend down the stipe (stem). The stipe is yellow to yellowish-brown in color and may have a ring or partial veil remnants.\n\nSuillus plorans is commonly found in association with pine forests, often growing in clusters or groups. It is known to be edible, although its culinary qualities are generally considered to be of moderate quality compared to other Suillus species.",
