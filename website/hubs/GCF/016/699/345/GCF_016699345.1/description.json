  "description": "Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian squirrel monkey, is a small New World primate species belonging to the genus Saimiri. This subspecies is found in the tropical forests of Bolivia, typically inhabiting the regions near the Amazon Basin.\n\nThe Bolivian squirrel monkey is characterized by its distinctive appearance, with a rounded head, large eyes, and a small, slender body. Their fur coloration is typically a yellowish-green on the back and sides, with a white or cream-colored underside. These monkeys are highly social, living in large troops that can range from a few individuals to over 100 members.\n\nSaimiri boliviensis boliviensis is an arboreal species, spending most of its time foraging and moving through the canopy of the tropical forests. Their diet consists primarily of insects, fruits, and small vertebrates. These monkeys are known for their agile and acrobatic movements, often leaping between branches and trees with remarkable speed and precision.\n\nThe Bolivian squirrel monkey is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation and human encroachment. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this subspecies and its natural environment.",
