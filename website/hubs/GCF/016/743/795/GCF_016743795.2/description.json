  "description": "Rickettsia tillamookensis is a species of bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites. It is a gram-negative, coccobacillary-shaped bacterium that is primarily found in ticks, particularly the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus).\n\nRickettsia tillamookensis was first isolated and identified in the early 1990s from ticks collected in the Tillamook County region of Oregon, United States. It is considered a member of the spotted fever group of Rickettsia, which includes several pathogenic species that can cause diseases in humans.\n\nThe genome of R. tillamookensis has been sequenced, and it has been shown to be closely related to other Rickettsia species, such as Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. However, the pathogenicity and potential for causing disease in humans have not been fully established for R. tillamookensis.\n\nFurther research is needed to better understand the ecological role, host interactions, and potential public health implications of this Rickettsia species, as it continues to be an area of interest in the study of tick-borne diseases.",
