  "description": "Suillus bovinus, commonly known as the Jersey cow bolete or bovine bolete, is a species of edible mushroom belonging to the genus Suillus. It is a member of the Boletaceae family, which includes various types of boletes known for their fleshy, porous undersides.\n\nS. bovinus is a medium-sized mushroom with a convex to flat cap that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The cap is typically yellowish-brown to reddish-brown in color and has a sticky, viscid surface when moist. The pore surface underneath the cap is initially whitish or pale yellow, but it can turn greenish-yellow with age.\n\nThe stipe (stem) of S. bovinus is typically short, thick, and yellowish-brown in color, often with a reddish-brown base. The mushroom exhibits a partial veil, which leaves a ring-like structure or annulus on the stipe.\n\nThis species is commonly found in coniferous forests, particularly under pine trees, where it forms symbiotic relationships with the tree roots through mycorrhizal associations. It is widely distributed throughout Europe and North America and is considered an edible mushroom, although it may cause digestive issues in some individuals.",
