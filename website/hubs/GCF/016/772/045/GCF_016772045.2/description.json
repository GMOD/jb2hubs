  "description": "Ovis aries, commonly known as the domestic sheep, is a species of ruminant mammal belonging to the family Bovidae. Domesticated for thousands of years, sheep are versatile and valuable livestock animals, providing meat, wool, milk, and other products for human use.\n\nPhysically, sheep are quadrupedal with a stocky build and short, sturdy legs. They have a distinctive woolly coat that can vary in color from white to black, brown, or gray. Sheep are known for their curved, spiral-shaped horns, which are present in both males (rams) and some females (ewes). The average weight of an adult sheep ranges from 45 to 100 kilograms, depending on the breed.\n\nSheep are herbivores, grazing on a variety of grasses, forbs, and other vegetation. They are ruminants, meaning they have a specialized four-chambered stomach that allows them to efficiently digest plant materials. Sheep are social animals, living in flocks with a well-established dominance hierarchy and communication through a range of vocalizations.\n\nOvis aries has been selectively bred over centuries to optimize various characteristics, such as wool quality, meat production, and adaptability to different environments. Domestic sheep play a significant role in many agricultural and pastoral systems worldwide, contributing to the livelihood and food security of human populations.",
