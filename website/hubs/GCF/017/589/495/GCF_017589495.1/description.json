  "description": "Alosa alosa, commonly known as the allis shad or allice shad, is a species of anadromous fish belonging to the herring family Clupeidae. It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, where it migrates between coastal marine environments and freshwater rivers to spawn.\n\nThe allis shad is a medium-sized fish, typically growing to a length of 30-50 cm. It has a streamlined, herring-like body shape with a large, silvery-white belly and a dark-colored back. The fish has a terminal mouth, a single dorsal fin, and a forked tail. Allis shad are filter feeders, primarily consuming small zooplankton and phytoplankton during their marine phase.\n\nAlosa alosa is an important commercial and recreational species, particularly in Europe, where it has been targeted for centuries. However, due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and other factors, many populations of the allis shad have declined significantly, leading to conservation concerns and management efforts in several countries.",
