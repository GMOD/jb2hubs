  "description": "Ochotona curzoniae, commonly known as the Curzon's pika or Tibetan pika, is a small mammal species belonging to the genus Ochotona, which are collectively referred to as \"pikas.\" Pikas are small, rabbit-like creatures found in mountainous regions of Asia.\n\nCurzon's pika is native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas in China, Bhutan, and India. It is typically found at high elevations, ranging from 3,000 to 5,500 meters above sea level, in alpine meadows, rocky areas, and talus slopes.\n\nPhysically, Curzon's pika is characterized by its compact, rounded body, short limbs, and rounded ears. Its fur is typically grayish-brown in color, with a white belly. Curzon's pika is a herbivorous species, feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other alpine vegetation.\n\nBehaviorally, Curzon's pika is known for its high-pitched, whistle-like calls, which it uses to communicate with members of its social group. It is a diurnal species, active during the day, and is known to be a good swimmer, able to cross small streams and rivers.\n\nCurzon's pika is an important species in the high-altitude ecosystems of the Tibetan Plateau, playing a role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. However, it faces threats from habitat loss, climate change, and hunting, and its conservation status is a subject of ongoing research and monitoring.",
