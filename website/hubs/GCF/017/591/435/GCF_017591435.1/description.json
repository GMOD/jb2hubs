  "description": "Portunus trituberculatus, also known as the three-spot swimming crab, is a species of crab belonging to the family Portunidae. It is found in the western Pacific Ocean, primarily in the coastal waters of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea.\n\nThe carapace (upper shell) of Portunus trituberculatus is broadly oval in shape and can reach a maximum width of up to 12 centimeters. The carapace is typically greenish-brown in color with three distinct tubercles (bumps) on the anterior (front) portion, which is the distinguishing feature of the species. The legs are flattened and adapted for swimming, with the last pair of legs being paddle-like in shape.\n\nPortunus trituberculatus is an important commercial species, particularly in China and Japan, where it is widely fished and consumed. It inhabits sandy or muddy coastal areas, often in estuaries and bays, and plays a significant role in the local marine ecosystems as both a predator and a prey species.\n\nThe species exhibits a complex life cycle, with larvae going through several developmental stages before reaching the adult form. Portunus trituberculatus is an important component of the marine food web, serving as a food source for various predators, including fish, birds, and other crustaceans.",
