  "description": "Carcharodon carcharias, commonly known as the great white shark, is a large, apex predatory species of shark that belongs to the family Lamnidae. It is one of the largest known extant fish species, reaching lengths of up to 6 meters (20 feet) and weighing up to 5,000 kilograms (11,000 pounds).\n\nThe great white shark is characterized by its robust, fusiform body, triangular-shaped teeth, and distinctive coloration â€“ dark gray on the upper body and white on the lower body. This coloration serves as camouflage, helping the shark blend in with the ocean's depths from above and the surface from below.\n\nGreat white sharks are found in cool, coastal waters in all the world's major oceans, with a distribution ranging from temperate to subtropical regions. They are highly migratory and opportunistic predators, feeding on a variety of prey, including fish, seals, sea lions, dolphins, and even other sharks.\n\nCarcharodon carcharias is an endothermic species, meaning it can regulate its body temperature to some degree, allowing it to maintain a higher metabolic rate and body temperature compared to its surrounding environment. This adaptation enhances its hunting and swimming capabilities.\n\nThe great white shark is considered a vulnerable species due to its low reproductive rate and susceptibility to overfishing. Conservation efforts and research continue to be essential for understanding and protecting this iconic marine predator.",
