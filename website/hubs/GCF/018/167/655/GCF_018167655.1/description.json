  "description": "Microtus oregoni, commonly known as the Oregonian or Oregon vole, is a small rodent species belonging to the genus Microtus, which includes various vole species. This species is found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America, primarily in the states of Oregon and Washington.\n\nThe Oregonian vole is a small mammal, typically measuring between 4.3 to 5.9 inches (11 to 15 cm) in total length, including the tail. They have a rounded body, short legs, and a short, hairy tail. Their fur is typically brown or grayish-brown in color, with a lighter underside. These voles are adapted to a fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle, with strong claws and a compact body shape that allows them to navigate through dense vegetation and underground tunnels.\n\nMicrotus oregoni is primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including grasses, sedges, and other herbaceous vegetation. They are important prey species for various predators, such as owls, snakes, and small carnivores, and play a crucial role in the ecosystems they inhabit.\n\nThe Oregonian vole is considered a habitat specialist, thriving in moist, densely vegetated areas, such as meadows, forest edges, and riparian zones. They construct intricate burrow systems and form small, social colonies. Reproduction in this species typically occurs during the spring and summer months, with females giving birth to litters of 2 to 6 young.\n\nDue to their specific habitat requirements and their importance in the food chain, the Oregonian vole is an indicator species, providing valuable information about the overall health and diversity of the ecosystems where they are found.",
