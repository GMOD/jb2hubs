  "description": "Panthera tigris, commonly known as the tiger, is a large feline species that belongs to the genus Panthera. Tigers are known for their distinctive orange and black striped fur, powerful build, and impressive physical capabilities. They are the largest living cat species, with adult tigers ranging in weight from 90 to 300 kilograms (200 to 660 pounds) and measuring up to 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) in length.\n\nTigers are carnivorous predators, primarily hunting large ungulates such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo. They are skilled ambush hunters, using their camouflage and stealth to approach their prey before making a powerful, explosive charge. Tigers are excellent swimmers and can also climb trees with ease.\n\nThe species is native to various regions of Asia, including India, China, Russia, and Southeast Asia. Tigers are classified as endangered, with populations declining due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic species and its natural habitats.",
