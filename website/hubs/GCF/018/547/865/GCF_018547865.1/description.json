  "description": "Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small, circular, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Deltavirus genus. It is considered a subviral agent, as it requires the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication and propagation.\n\nHDV is unique among human viruses in that it does not encode its own polymerase and instead relies on the host cell's RNA polymerase II for transcription and replication of its genome. The HDV genome is approximately 1.7 kilobases in length and encodes a single protein, the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), which is essential for the virus's life cycle.\n\nHDV infection can occur either as a co-infection with HBV or as a superinfection in individuals already infected with HBV. HDV co-infection can lead to more severe liver disease, including acute fulminant hepatitis, while HDV superinfection can cause rapid progression to chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nThe prevalence of HDV infection varies globally, with higher rates observed in parts of the world where HBV is endemic, such as certain regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Effective prevention and treatment of HDV infection rely on the prevention and control of HBV infection through vaccination and the development of specific antiviral therapies targeting HDV.",
