  "description": "Macacine alphaherpesvirus 1, also known as Herpes B virus or Monkey B virus, is a species of alphaherpesvirus that primarily infects macaque monkeys, particularly the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is a member of the genus Simplexvirus, which includes the well-known human herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2).\n\nMacacine alphaherpesvirus 1 is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 156 kilobase pairs. The virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected macaque body fluids, such as saliva, mucus, or tissue. In its natural host, the rhesus macaque, the virus typically causes a mild, self-limiting infection, often with no apparent symptoms.\n\nHowever, in humans, Macacine alphaherpesvirus 1 can cause a rare but severe and potentially fatal neurological disease known as Herpes B virus infection or \"monkey B virus infection.\" Human infections are extremely uncommon but can occur through exposure to infected macaque body fluids, typically during laboratory work or accidental bites or scratches. If left untreated, Herpes B virus infection in humans can progress rapidly and lead to fatal encephalitis (brain inflammation) and other serious complications.\n\nDue to the high mortality rate associated with Herpes B virus infection in humans, strict safety protocols and preventive measures are essential when working with macaque monkeys or their tissues in laboratory settings or other contexts.",
