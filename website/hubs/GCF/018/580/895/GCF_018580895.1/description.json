  "description": "Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus that belongs to the family Anelloviridae. It was first discovered in the serum of a Japanese patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology in 1997.\n\nTTV is widely distributed in the human population, with a global prevalence of up to 90% in some regions. The virus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, although it can also be transmitted through blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids.\n\nThe TTV genome is approximately 3.8 kilobases in length and encodes several open reading frames (ORFs) that are responsible for the production of various viral proteins. The exact function of these proteins and the complete viral life cycle are not yet fully understood.\n\nInterestingly, TTV is considered a \"ubiquitous\" virus, meaning that it is commonly found in healthy individuals and is not necessarily associated with any specific disease. However, some studies have suggested a potential link between TTV infection and certain clinical conditions, such as liver diseases, respiratory disorders, and immunological disorders, although the causal relationship is still a subject of ongoing research.\n\nDue to its widespread prevalence and potential clinical implications, TTV continues to be an active area of research in the field of virology and infectious disease.",
