  "description": "Tyto alba, commonly known as the barn owl, is a species of nocturnal bird of prey belonging to the family Tytonidae. It is a medium-sized owl with a distinctive heart-shaped facial disc and large, dark eyes.\n\nThe barn owl has a worldwide distribution, found on every continent except Antarctica. It is a highly adaptable species that can thrive in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, deserts, and urban areas.\n\nPhysically, the barn owl is characterized by its large, rounded head, short beak, and long, rounded wings. Its plumage is primarily white and buff-colored, with a speckled pattern that provides excellent camouflage. The species is known for its acute hearing and vision, which allow it to locate and capture small rodents, its primary prey.\n\nBehaviorally, the barn owl is a solitary and territorial species. It is primarily nocturnal, hunting at night and roosting during the day in sheltered locations such as barns, abandoned buildings, or tree cavities. The species is known for its distinctive, screeching call, which it uses to communicate and mark its territory.\n\nTyto alba is a well-studied species, with a rich body of scientific literature on its ecology, behavior, and conservation status. It is generally considered a species of least concern, but population declines have been observed in some regions due to factors such as habitat loss and the use of rodenticides.",
