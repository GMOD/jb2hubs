  "description": "Megalobrama amblycephala, commonly known as the Wuchang bream or Wuchang fish, is a species of freshwater cyprinid fish native to China. It is a member of the genus Megalobrama, which includes several large bream species found in East Asia.\n\nThe Wuchang bream is a large, robust fish with a blunt, rounded head and a subterminal mouth. It can grow up to 60 cm in length and can weigh up to 4 kg. The body is deep and laterally compressed, with large scales covering the flanks. The fins are relatively small, with the dorsal fin positioned slightly behind the midpoint of the body.\n\nMegalobrama amblycephala is an important commercial and aquaculture species in China, where it is widely cultivated in ponds and reservoirs. It is an omnivorous fish, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, zooplankton, and small invertebrates. The species is known for its high tolerance to poor water quality and its ability to thrive in eutrophic environments.\n\nConservation-wise, the Wuchang bream is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, as it is widely distributed and has a stable population in its native range. However, it may face threats from habitat degradation, overfishing, and the introduction of non-native species in some areas.",
