  "description": "Sceloporus undulatus, commonly known as the eastern fence lizard, is a species of lizard native to the eastern and central United States. It belongs to the genus Sceloporus, a group of small to medium-sized lizards commonly referred to as spiny lizards or tree lizards.\n\nThe eastern fence lizard is a medium-sized, slender-bodied lizard with a snout-to-vent length typically ranging from 50 to 75 millimeters. It has a distinct pattern of dark, wavy crossbands on its back, which gives it its specific epithet \"undulatus.\" The lizard's coloration can vary from grayish-brown to reddish-brown, with males often displaying bright blue patches on their throat and sides during the breeding season.\n\nThese lizards are ectothermic, meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. They are found in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, rocky areas, and human-modified environments, such as fences and walls, from which they derive their common name.\n\nSceloporus undulatus is an insectivorous species, feeding primarily on small invertebrates, including spiders, insects, and other arthropods. They are known for their ability to run and climb quickly, and they often use these behaviors to escape from predators.\n\nThe eastern fence lizard plays an important role in the ecosystem, serving as a prey item for various predators, such as snakes, birds, and mammals. Additionally, their presence can be used as an indicator of the overall health of the local environment.",
