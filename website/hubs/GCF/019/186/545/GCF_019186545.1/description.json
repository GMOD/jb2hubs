  "description": "Solanum stenotomum, commonly known as the Andigena potato, is a wild species of potato native to the Andes region of South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Solanaceae.\n\nThe key characteristics of Solanum stenotomum are:\n\n1. Growth Habit: It is a low-growing, spreading plant that can reach up to 60 cm in height.\n\n2. Leaves: The leaves are pinnately compound, with 5-9 leaflets that are oblong to lanceolate in shape.\n\n3. Flowers: The flowers are white or purple in color, with five petals and five stamens.\n\n4. Tubers: The plant produces small, round to oval-shaped tubers that are often pigmented with various colors, including purple, red, yellow, or white.\n\n5. Genetic Diversity: Solanum stenotomum is considered one of the progenitor species of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum) and exhibits a high level of genetic diversity, making it a valuable genetic resource for potato breeding and improvement programs.\n\n6. Habitat and Distribution: It is found growing wild in the Andes mountains of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia, often at high elevations between 3,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level.\n\nSolanum stenotomum is an important genetic resource for potato breeding due to its adaptations to the harsh environmental conditions of the Andes and its potential to contribute valuable traits, such as disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance, to cultivated potato varieties.",
