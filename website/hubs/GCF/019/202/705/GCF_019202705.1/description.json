  "description": "Candida subhashii is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Candida. It is a type of ascomycetous fungus, meaning it reproduces through the formation of ascospores.\n\nCandida subhashii was first isolated from soil samples collected in India. It is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through the formation of blastoconidia (budding yeast cells). The cells are typically oval or spherical in shape and range in size from approximately 3-6 micrometers in diameter.\n\nPhylogenetically, Candida subhashii is closely related to other Candida species, but it can be distinguished from them based on its unique genetic and physiological characteristics. For example, Candida subhashii is able to assimilate certain carbon and nitrogen sources that are not utilized by closely related Candida species.\n\nWhile Candida species are commonly associated with opportunistic infections in humans, the pathogenic potential of Candida subhashii is not well-established. Further research is needed to determine its ecological roles and potential applications in biotechnology or industry.",
