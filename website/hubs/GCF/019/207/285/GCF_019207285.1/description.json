  "description": "Ogataea haglerorum is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Ogataea. The genus Ogataea is a member of the phylum Ascomycota, which is a large and diverse group of fungi that reproduce through the formation of spores.\n\nOgataea haglerorum is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through the process of budding. The cells are typically oval or ellipsoid in shape and measure approximately 2-4 micrometers in diameter. The species is known to be able to assimilate a variety of carbon and nitrogen sources, making it a versatile and adaptable organism.\n\nOgataea haglerorum was first isolated from soil samples collected in the United States. The species is named after the Haglers, a family who was involved in the original isolation and characterization of the yeast. While the ecological role and specific functions of Ogataea haglerorum in natural environments are not fully understood, the species is of interest to researchers due to its potential applications in biotechnology and industrial processes.",
