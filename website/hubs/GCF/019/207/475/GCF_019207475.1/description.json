  "description": "Ogataea angusta is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Ogataea. Ogataea is a genus of ascomycetous yeasts that are classified within the family Pichiaceae.\n\nOgataea angusta is a haploid, unicellular organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically ovoid or ellipsoidal in shape, with a size range of approximately 2-4 μm in width and 3-6 μm in length.\n\nThis species is known to be found in various natural environments, such as soil, decaying plant material, and the gut of insects. It is considered a member of the normal microbial community in these habitats.\n\nOgataea angusta is capable of utilizing a range of carbon sources for growth, including glucose, sucrose, and other sugars. It can also grow in the presence of various organic acids and alcohols.\n\nGenetically, Ogataea angusta has been studied and its genome has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. This information can contribute to our understanding of the ecology and role of this yeast species in its natural environments.",
