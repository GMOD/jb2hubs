It is commonly used in pastures, hayfields, and as a component in lawn and sports turf mixtures due to its ability to establish quickly, form a dense sward, and maintain a vibrant green color throughout the growing season.\n\nLolium perenne is known for its high nutritional value, making it a valuable forage crop for livestock. It is also widely used in the turfgrass industry for its resilience, aesthetic appeal, and ability to withstand heavy foot traffic.",
