  "description": "Myxocyprinus asiaticus, commonly known as the Asian sucker, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the family Catostomidae. It is native to the upper Yangtze River basin in China.\n\nThe Asian sucker is a relatively large fish, typically reaching lengths of up to 80 cm (31 inches). It has a distinctive sucker-like mouth adapted for feeding on algae and other plant matter found in its riverine habitat. The body is elongated and slightly compressed laterally, with a small, pointed head and large, protruding eyes.\n\nMyxocyprinus asiaticus is an important component of the aquatic ecosystem in its native range, playing a role in nutrient cycling and the control of algal growth. It is also of economic importance, as it is widely cultured and farmed for human consumption in parts of China.\n\nThe species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but its populations may be threatened by factors such as habitat degradation, overfishing, and the construction of dams and hydroelectric projects in its native river systems.",
