  "description": "Ogataea philodendri is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Ogataea, which is a member of the phylum Ascomycota. This species was first isolated from the leaves of the philodendron plant (Philodendron spp.), hence the specific epithet \"philodendri.\"\n\nOgataea philodendri is a unicellular, eukaryotic organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are typically oval or round in shape and measure approximately 3-6 micrometers in diameter. The yeast colony appears creamy white to pale yellow in color and has a smooth, glistening surface.\n\nOgataea philodendri is known to be a psychrophilic (cold-loving) species, meaning it can grow and thrive at relatively low temperatures, often between 10-25Â°C. This adaptation allows the yeast to colonize the leaves of tropical plants, such as philodendrons, which may experience cooler temperatures compared to the surrounding environment.\n\nTaxonomically, Ogataea philodendri is classified within the Saccharomycetales order and the Saccharomycetaceae family. Genetic analyses have shown that this species is closely related to other members of the Ogataea genus, which are known to be associated with various plant species.\n\nThe ecological significance of Ogataea philodendri lies in its potential role as a plant-associated microorganism, potentially playing a role in the plant's microbiome or contributing to nutrient cycling within the plant's ecosystem.",
