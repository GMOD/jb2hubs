  "description": "Truncatella angustata is a species of small terrestrial gastropod mollusk, a land snail, in the family Truncatellidae. The species is known to be found in Europe, particularly in countries such as France, Italy, and Greece.\n\nThe shell of Truncatella angustata is small, measuring around 4-5 millimeters in height. It has a distinctive truncated spire, which gives the shell a cylindrical appearance. The shell's surface is smooth and glossy, with a light brown or grayish-brown color.\n\nTruncatella angustata is a member of the family Truncatellidae, which are known as \"land snails\" despite their ability to survive in both terrestrial and aquatic environments. These snails are typically found in coastal areas, often near the water's edge or in damp, shaded habitats.\n\nThe species is known to be a detritivore, feeding on decaying organic matter and plant material. Its distribution and habitat preferences make it an important component of the coastal and riparian ecosystems where it is found.",
