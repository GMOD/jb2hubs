  "description": "Corvus hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian Crow or 'Alala, is a species of crow endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the genus Corvus, which includes crows, ravens, and jackdaws.\n\nThe Hawaiian Crow is a medium-sized bird, typically measuring around 45-50 cm in length. It has a distinctive all-black plumage, with a strong, slightly hooked beak and robust legs. The species is known for its intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and complex social behaviors, which are typical characteristics of the Corvidae family.\n\nHistorically, the Hawaiian Crow was found on the islands of Hawaii and Maui, but due to habitat loss, hunting, and the introduction of non-native predators, the species became critically endangered. In 2002, the last known wild population of Hawaiian Crows went extinct, and the species is now maintained in captive breeding programs for potential future reintroduction efforts.\n\nThe conservation of the Hawaiian Crow is crucial as it plays an important role in the island's ecosystem, serving as a seed disperser and contributing to the maintenance of the native forests. Ongoing efforts to protect and restore the species' habitat, as well as the continuation of captive breeding programs, are essential for the potential recovery of this unique Hawaiian endemic bird.",
