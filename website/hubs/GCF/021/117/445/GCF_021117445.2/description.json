  "description": "Syzygium oleosum, also known as the olive bush cherry or olive satinash, is a species of evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes many other well-known fruit-bearing trees like guava and eucalyptus.\n\nS. oleosum typically grows between 3-15 meters tall and has a dense, spreading canopy. The leaves are dark green, leathery, and oval-shaped, with a distinctive oil gland visible on the surface. Small, white flowers are produced in clusters, followed by small, olive-shaped fruits that turn purple-black when ripe.\n\nThe species is adapted to growing in subtropical and coastal rainforest habitats, where it can be a dominant understory plant. The fruits are edible and have been utilized by Indigenous Australians, though they have a relatively bland flavor. S. oleosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for use as a hedge or screening plant.",
