  "description": "Oncorhynchus gorbuscha, commonly known as the Pink Salmon or Humpback Salmon, is a species of anadromous Pacific salmon found in the Northern Pacific Ocean and adjacent rivers. It is one of the smallest and most abundant species of Pacific salmon.\n\nThe key scientific characteristics of Oncorhynchus gorbuscha are:\n\n1. Lifecycle: It is an anadromous fish, meaning it spends part of its life in the ocean and part in freshwater rivers and streams. Adults return to spawn in their natal streams after 1-2 years in the ocean.\n\n2. Morphology: It has a streamlined, torpedo-shaped body with a small, hooked upper jaw (kype) that develops in spawning males. Its body color changes from silvery-blue in the ocean to bright pink or reddish-purple during the spawning run.\n\n3. Size: Typically, the adult Pink Salmon range from 12 to 31 inches (30 to 80 cm) in length and weigh 3.3 to 15 pounds (1.5 to 6.8 kg).\n\n4. Habitat: They are found in the coastal waters and rivers of the North Pacific Ocean, from northern California to Alaska and across to northeastern Asia, including Russia and Japan.\n\n5. Reproduction: Spawning occurs in small streams and tributaries, where the females dig nests (redds) in the gravel to deposit their eggs. The males fertilize the eggs, and the parents then die after spawning.\n\n6. Importance: Pink Salmon are a valuable commercial and subsistence fishery resource, as well as an important part of the ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators, including bears, eagles, and other fish.",
