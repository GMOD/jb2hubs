  "description": "Mirounga angustirostris, commonly known as the northern elephant seal, is a large, semi-aquatic pinniped species found primarily along the Pacific coast of North America. This species is characterized by its massive size, with adult males typically weighing between 1,500 to 2,500 kilograms and reaching lengths of up to 5 meters.\n\nMirounga angustirostris is a member of the family Phocidae, also known as true seals. They are known for their distinctive long, proboscis-like snout, which is more pronounced in adult males and is used during territorial disputes and breeding rituals. Their thick, grayish-brown fur and considerable body fat provide insulation and buoyancy in the cold ocean waters they inhabit.\n\nThese seals are highly migratory, with individuals spending most of the year foraging in the open ocean, diving to depths of up to 1,500 meters to hunt for a variety of prey, including fish, squid, and crustaceans. During the breeding season, they come ashore to mate and give birth to their pups, typically on remote, sandy beaches or rocky coastal areas.\n\nMirounga angustirostris play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as both predators and prey within the marine food web. Their population numbers have fluctuated over the years, with conservation efforts helping to recover the species from near-extinction in the early 20th century.",
