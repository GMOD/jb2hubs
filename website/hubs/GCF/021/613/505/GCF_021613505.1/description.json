  "description": "Equus quagga, commonly known as the plains zebra, is a species of zebra native to eastern and southern Africa. It is one of three surviving species of zebra, alongside the mountain zebra (Equus zebra) and the Gr√©vy's zebra (Equus grevyi).\n\nThe plains zebra is a medium-sized equid, typically standing around 1.2 to 1.5 meters tall at the shoulder. It has a distinctive black and white striped coat pattern, which is believed to serve as camouflage and a defense against biting flies. The stripes are unique to each individual, similar to human fingerprints, and can be used for identification purposes.\n\nThese zebras are highly social animals, living in large herds that are led by a dominant female. They are grazers, feeding primarily on grasses and other vegetation. They are known for their migratory behavior, often moving in search of water and grazing resources.\n\nThe plains zebra is classified as \"Least Concern\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, though populations have declined in some areas due to habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this iconic African species.",
