  "description": "Rhincodon typus, commonly known as the whale shark, is the largest known extant species of fish. It is a filter-feeding, plankton-eating shark that belongs to the order Orectolobiformes and the family Rhincodontidae.\n\nThe whale shark is a huge, slow-moving, and gentle marine creature that can grow up to 18 meters (59 feet) in length and weigh more than 20 metric tons (22 short tons). It has a distinctive pattern of pale gray to white spots and stripes on a dark background, which helps in its identification.\n\nThese sharks are found in tropical and warm temperate waters around the world, and they typically inhabit the open ocean, often near productive coastlines. They are known to feed on a variety of small prey, including plankton, small fish, and crustaceans, which they filter from the water through their massive mouths.\n\nWhale sharks are considered vulnerable to extinction due to various threats, including bycatch, vessel strikes, and habitat degradation. Conservation efforts have been implemented in many regions to protect this gentle giant and ensure its continued survival.",
