It plays a crucial role in the food web, serving as prey for larger predatory fish, birds, and marine mammals. The species is also of ecological and cultural significance to the region.\n\nDue to various threats, such as habitat loss, water diversions, and invasive species, the Delta smelt has experienced significant population declines over the past few decades.
