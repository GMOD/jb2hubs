  "description": "Lucilia cuprina, commonly known as the Australian green blowfly or sheep blowfly, is a species of fly belonging to the family Calliphoridae. It is native to Australia and New Zealand and is an important pest species in these regions.\n\nThe adult L. cuprina flies are typically green or bronze in color, with metallic-looking bodies. They have large compound eyes and well-developed flight muscles, enabling them to be strong and agile flyers. The females lay their eggs on decaying organic matter, such as carrion or open wounds on livestock, particularly sheep.\n\nThe larvae, or maggots, of L. cuprina are voracious feeders and can cause significant damage to livestock through a condition known as \"flystrike\" or \"myiasis.\" The larvae burrow into the skin of the host animal, feeding on the living tissue and causing severe tissue damage, inflammation, and even death if left untreated.\n\nL. cuprina is an important species in the field of forensic entomology, as the presence and development stage of the larvae can be used to estimate the time of death in criminal investigations. Additionally, the species has been studied for its potential use in the biological control of other pest insects and in the production of valuable biomass, such as for the production of biodiesel.",
