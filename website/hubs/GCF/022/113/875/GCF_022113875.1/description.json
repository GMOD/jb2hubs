  "description": "Hydra vulgaris, also known as the common freshwater hydra, is a small, carnivorous, freshwater invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Cnidaria. It is a simple, sac-like organism that typically measures between 0.5 to 10 millimeters in length when fully extended.\n\nHydra vulgaris is characterized by a cylindrical body with a foot-like structure called a basal disc at one end, and a ring of tentacles surrounding the mouth at the other end. The tentacles are equipped with specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are used to capture and immobilize small prey, such as small crustaceans, insect larvae, and other aquatic microorganisms.\n\nHydra vulgaris exhibits remarkable regenerative abilities, as it can regrow its entire body from a small fragment if it is cut or damaged. This unique feature has made it a valuable model organism for the study of stem cell biology and developmental processes.\n\nThe species is widely distributed in freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams, where it plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystem as a predator and a food source for other organisms.",
