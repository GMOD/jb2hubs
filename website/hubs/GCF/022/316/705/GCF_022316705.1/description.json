  "description": "Stegostoma tigrinum, commonly known as the zebra shark, is a species of carpet shark found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Stegostomatidae, which is the only extant family within the order Orectolobiformes.\n\nThe zebra shark is characterized by its distinctive coloration, which features a pattern of dark brown or black stripes and spots on a pale yellow or white background. This unique pattern helps the shark blend in with its coral reef and seagrass habitats. As the shark matures, the stripes typically fade, and the body becomes more uniformly spotted.\n\nZebra sharks are typically found at depths ranging from the surface to around 70 meters (230 feet). They are known to be relatively slow-moving and docile, often resting during the day and becoming more active at night. Their diet consists mainly of small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nReproduction in the zebra shark is ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the live young are then birthed. Females can give birth to litters of up to 35 pups after a gestation period of around 12 months.\n\nThe zebra shark is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species due to threats such as habitat degradation, bycatch in commercial fisheries, and targeted fishing for its fins and meat. Conservation efforts and protective measures are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique and charismatic species.",
