  "description": "Scophthalmus maximus, commonly known as the turbot, is a species of large, flatfish belonging to the family Scophthalmidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea.\n\nThe turbot is a benthic fish, living on the seafloor and preying on a variety of small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It has a distinctive, flattened body shape with both eyes located on the left side of its head, a characteristic of flatfish species. The body color is typically brown or grayish-brown, which helps the turbot camouflage itself on the seabed.\n\nTurbot are considered a highly valuable commercial fish, prized for their firm, white flesh and delicate flavor. They are an important target species for commercial and recreational fisheries throughout their range. Due to their high demand and overfishing in some areas, conservation efforts have been implemented to ensure the sustainability of turbot populations.",
