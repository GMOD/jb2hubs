  "description": "Annulohypoxylon maeteangense is a species of fungus that belongs to the Ascomycota phylum. It is a member of the Xylariaceae family, which is known for its diverse group of wood-decay fungi.\n\nAnnulohypoxylon maeteangense is a pyrenomycetous fungus, meaning it produces its sexual spores (ascospores) within a specialized, flask-shaped structure called a perithecium. These perithecia are typically found growing on the surface of decaying wood.\n\nThe key identifying features of A. maeteangense include its dark-colored, carbonaceous stromata (fruiting bodies) that have a distinct annular, or ring-like, arrangement of perithecia on the surface. The ascospores produced within the perithecia are dark-colored, typically ellipsoid in shape, and often have a gelatinous sheath surrounding them.\n\nThis species was first described from specimens collected in Thailand and is believed to be endemic to the Maeteang area of that country, where it was originally discovered growing on decaying wood. Further research may reveal its distribution in other regions as well.",
