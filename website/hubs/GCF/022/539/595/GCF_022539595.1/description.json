  "description": "Amphiprion ocellaris, commonly known as the Clownfish or Anemonefish, is a species of marine fish that belongs to the family Pomacentridae. It is a small, brightly colored fish that is known for its mutualistic relationship with sea anemones.\n\nAmphiprion ocellaris is typically orange or reddish-orange in color, with three distinctive white bands that encircle its body. The fish's body is laterally compressed, which helps it navigate the small crevices and spaces within the sea anemone's tentacles. The species' small size, typically ranging from 8 to 11 centimeters in length, allows it to take shelter within the anemone's protective tentacles.\n\nThe Clownfish is found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea to the western Pacific Ocean. It lives in close association with sea anemones, which provide the fish with both shelter and protection from predators. In turn, the Clownfish helps to clean the anemone and also acts as a \"cleaner\" for other fish, removing parasites and dead tissue.\n\nAmphiprion ocellaris is a sequential hermaphrodite, meaning that it can change its sex from male to female. The largest and most dominant individual in a group becomes the female, while the smaller individuals remain male. The species is also known for its complex social hierarchy and parental care behaviors, with the female and male working together to protect and care for their offspring.",
