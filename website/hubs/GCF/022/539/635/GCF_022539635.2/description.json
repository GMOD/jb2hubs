  "description": "Chironomus tepperi is a species of non-biting midge, which is a type of small fly belonging to the family Chironomidae. It is commonly known as the Australian chironomid or Tepperi's midge.\n\nChironomus tepperi is native to Australia and can be found in various aquatic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The larvae of this species live in the sediment of these water bodies, where they feed on organic matter and algae.\n\nThe adult Chironomus tepperi are small, delicate flies that resemble mosquitoes, but they do not bite. The adults have a distinctive appearance, with long, slender legs and feathery antennae. They typically measure around 5-10 millimeters in length.\n\nThis species plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystem, as the larvae serve as a food source for various predators, such as fish, amphibians, and wading birds. Additionally, the presence of Chironomus tepperi can be used as an indicator of water quality, as they are sensitive to environmental changes and pollution.\n\nOverall, Chironomus tepperi is a common and ecologically significant species of non-biting midge found in the freshwater habitats of Australia.",
