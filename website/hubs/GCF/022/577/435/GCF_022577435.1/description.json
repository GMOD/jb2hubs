  "description": "Embiotoca jacksoni, commonly known as the black surfperch or Jackson's surfperch, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Embiotocidae, also known as the surfperches. This species is native to the coastal waters of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, primarily found along the western coast of North America, from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico.\n\nEmbiotoca jacksoni is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 30 centimeters (12 inches). The body is laterally compressed and oval-shaped, with a small, slightly protruding mouth and a single, continuous dorsal fin. The coloration of this species is generally dark, with a blackish or dark brown back and sides, often with a bluish or greenish iridescent sheen. The fins are also dark in color.\n\nAs a member of the surfperch family, Embiotoca jacksoni is a viviparous fish, meaning that it gives birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The females carry the developing embryos within their bodies, nourishing them through a placenta-like structure. The young are born fully developed and able to swim independently.\n\nThis species primarily inhabits rocky, kelp-covered areas and is often found in close association with kelp beds and other marine vegetation. They feed on a variety of small invertebrates, such as crustaceans, mollusks, and small fishes, using their small, protruding mouths to capture their prey.\n\nEmbiotoca jacksoni is an important component of the nearshore marine ecosystem, serving as a food source for larger predatory fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals. Additionally, this species is a popular target for recreational anglers and is considered an important part of the regional fisheries.",
