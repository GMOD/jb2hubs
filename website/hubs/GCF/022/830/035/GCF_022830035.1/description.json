  "description": "Ophidiomyces ophidiicola is a fungal pathogen that primarily infects snakes. It is the causative agent of snake fungal disease (SFD), an emerging infectious disease that has been observed in wild snake populations across North America and Europe.\n\nOphidiomyces ophidiicola is a member of the Ascomycota phylum, Eurotiomycetes class, and Onygenales order. It is a slow-growing, keratinophilic fungus that can penetrate and colonize the skin, scales, and other keratinized tissues of snakes.\n\nThe fungus produces hyphae that can invade the epidermis and dermis of the snake's skin, leading to the development of crusty lesions, skin thickening, and discoloration. Severe infections can result in scale disintegration, nodular growths, and even systemic illness and death in affected snakes.\n\nOphidiomyces ophidiicola is believed to be transmitted through direct contact between infected and uninfected snakes, as well as through environmental exposure to contaminated substrates or surfaces. The fungus can survive in the environment and may also be present in the soil or water where snakes live.\n\nUnderstanding the ecology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Ophidiomyces ophidiicola is crucial for developing effective management strategies and conservation efforts to mitigate the impact of snake fungal disease on vulnerable snake populations.",
