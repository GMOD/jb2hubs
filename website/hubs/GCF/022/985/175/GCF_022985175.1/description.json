  "description": "Labeo rohita, commonly known as the rohu or rui, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the carp family Cyprinidae. It is native to the river systems of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in the Ganges and Brahmaputra river basins.\n\nThe rohu is a large, silver-colored fish with a distinctive hump on its head and a downward-facing mouth. It is an important food fish and is widely cultivated in aquaculture systems across South Asia. The species is known for its fast growth rate, adaptability to various environmental conditions, and ability to feed on a wide range of aquatic vegetation and detritus.\n\nRohu are typically found in slow-moving or stagnant waters, such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. They play a significant role in the aquatic ecosystem, serving as a primary consumer and contributing to the overall food web dynamics. The species is also valued for its cultural and recreational importance in the region.\n\nConservation efforts have been undertaken to manage and sustain the wild populations of Labeo rohita, as the species faces threats from overfishing, habitat degradation, and the impacts of climate change. Ongoing research and management strategies aim to ensure the long-term survival and sustainable utilization of this economically and ecologically important freshwater fish.",
