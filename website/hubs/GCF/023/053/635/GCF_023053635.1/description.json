  "description": "Elgaria multicarinata webbii, commonly known as the San Diego alligator lizard, is a subspecies of the southern alligator lizard that is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. \n\nThis small to medium-sized lizard typically measures between 15-25 cm in total length, with a long, slender body and a broad, flattened head. Its dorsal coloration can vary from shades of brown to gray, with a series of dark crossbars or blotches along the back. The underside is typically lighter in color, often with a yellowish or whitish hue.\n\nElgaria m. webbii is distinguished from other alligator lizard subspecies by its smaller size, more pronounced dorsal keels, and the presence of enlarged scales on the dorsal surface. It primarily inhabits dry, rocky habitats, such as chaparral, coastal sage scrub, and oak woodlands, where it forages for insects, small invertebrates, and occasionally small vertebrates.\n\nThis subspecies is known for its ability to detach its tail as a defense mechanism when threatened. The lost tail can regenerate over time, but the new growth is often a different color than the original. Elgaria m. webbii is generally a docile lizard and poses no threat to humans, though it may bite if handled.",
