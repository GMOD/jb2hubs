  "description": "Clinocottus analis, commonly known as the Wooly Sculpin or Bull Sculpin, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the Cottidae family. This species is native to the western coast of North America, inhabiting coastal streams and estuaries from Alaska to Baja California.\n\nThe Wooly Sculpin is characterized by its flattened, broad head and large, rounded pectoral fins. Its body is covered in thick, velvety skin, which gives it a distinctive \"wooly\" appearance. The fish typically ranges in color from dark brown to grey, with mottled patterns that help it camouflage among the rocks and vegetation of its habitat.\n\nClinocottus analis is a bottom-dwelling predator, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates and smaller fish. It uses its large pectoral fins to maintain its position in the swift-moving currents of its preferred habitat. This species is an important component of the coastal ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predatory fish, birds, and other wildlife.\n\nEcologically, the Wooly Sculpin plays a role in the food web, contributing to the overall biodiversity and balance of the coastal aquatic environments in which it resides. Its adaptations to its specific habitat and feeding habits make it a unique and fascinating member of the Cottidae family.",
