  "description": "Haliotis rufescens, commonly known as the red abalone, is a species of large sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Haliotidae, the abalone family.\n\nThe red abalone is native to the cold, rocky waters off the Pacific coast of North America, from Mendocino County, California, to Baja California, Mexico. It is known for its distinctive reddish-brown shell, which can grow up to 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter.\n\nThe shell of the red abalone has a series of respiratory pores, called tremata, which allow the animal to respire underwater. The foot of the abalone is large and muscular, allowing it to cling tightly to rocks and withstand the strong wave action in its habitat.\n\nRed abalones are herbivorous, feeding primarily on various species of kelp and other marine algae. They play an important ecological role in the kelp forest ecosystem, helping to maintain the balance between kelp and other primary producers.\n\nDue to their size, flavor, and popularity as a food source, red abalones have been heavily harvested, leading to concerns about their conservation status. Efforts to manage and protect wild populations, as well as to cultivate red abalones in aquaculture, are ongoing.",
