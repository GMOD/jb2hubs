  "description": "Budorcas taxicolor, commonly known as the takin, is a bovid species native to the eastern Himalayas and adjacent ranges in China, Bhutan, and northeastern India. It is the sole extant member of the genus Budorcas.\n\nThe takin is a large, stocky, and robust ungulate with a distinctive appearance. It has a broad, rounded head, short, curved horns, and a thick, shaggy coat that varies in color from yellowish-brown to dark brown, often with a black mane and legs. The takin's body is compact and muscular, with short legs and large, cloven hooves that are well-adapted for navigating the rugged, mountainous terrain of its habitat.\n\nTakins are herbivores, feeding primarily on grasses, herbs, and shrubs. They are found in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests, as well as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, at elevations ranging from around 2,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level.\n\nThe takin is considered a national treasure in China and has been the subject of various cultural and religious beliefs. It is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, with threats to its population including habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting for its meat and fur.",
