  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no known scientific species called the \"Kander virus.\" This appears to be a fictional virus name, as I could not find any credible scientific literature or information about a virus by this name. Without more context about the fictional details of this virus, I cannot provide a meaningful scientific description. Viruses are typically named and classified based on their genetic makeup, structural characteristics, and the diseases they cause, but a virus called the \"Kander virus\" does not seem to exist in the real world. If you have additional details about this fictional virus, I'd be happy to try and provide a more informed scientific overview. However, as it stands, I do not have any factual information to include in a description for this particular viral species.",
