  "description": "The Thailand tick thogotovirus is a species of tick-borne virus belonging to the genus Thogotovirus, which is part of the family Orthomyxoviridae. This virus was first isolated from ticks collected in Thailand in the 1960s.\n\nThe Thailand tick thogotovirus is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. It has a segmented genome, typically with six or seven genomic segments. The virus primarily infects and replicates within tick vectors, particularly hard ticks of the genus Haemaphysalis.\n\nSerologically, the Thailand tick thogotovirus is closely related to other Thogotovirus species, such as the Thogoto virus, which is found in Africa. However, genetic and phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the Thailand tick thogotovirus as a distinct viral species.\n\nWhile the natural reservoir and transmission dynamics of the Thailand tick thogotovirus are not fully understood, it is believed to be maintained in nature through tick-vertebrate host cycles. The potential for this virus to cause disease in humans or animals is an area of ongoing research and surveillance.",
