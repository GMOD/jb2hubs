  "description": "Upolu virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus Orthonairovirus, which is a part of the Nairoviridae family. It was first isolated from ticks collected in Upolu, Samoa, in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Upolu virus has a genome composed of three segments of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA. The virus is spherical in shape and has a diameter of approximately 90-100 nanometers. It is classified as a member of the Orthonairovirus genus based on its genetic and structural similarities to other viruses within this genus.\n\nUpolu virus is primarily transmitted by ticks and has been found to infect various vertebrate hosts, including small mammals and birds. However, the full host range and potential for human infection by this virus are not yet well-established. Further research is needed to understand the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and public health significance of the Upolu virus.",
