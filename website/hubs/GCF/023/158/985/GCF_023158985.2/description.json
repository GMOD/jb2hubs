  "description": "Ostrea edulis, commonly known as the European flat oyster or edible oyster, is a species of bivalve mollusk that belongs to the family Ostreidae. It is native to the coastal waters of Europe, ranging from Norway to Morocco, including the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe European flat oyster has a distinctive flattened and irregularly shaped shell, with the upper valve being slightly convex and the lower valve being more concave. The shell surface is typically rough and uneven, with a grayish-white or brownish coloration. The internal shell surface is smooth and pearly in appearance.\n\nOstrea edulis is a sessile organism, meaning it attaches itself to hard surfaces such as rocks, piers, or other oyster shells during its larval stage. As an adult, it remains firmly cemented to the substrate, relying on the flow of water to bring in food particles and oxygen.\n\nThe species is known for its culinary and commercial importance, as it is widely consumed as a delicacy in many European countries. It has been a part of the human diet for centuries and has played a significant role in the cultural and economic development of coastal communities.\n\nDue to overfishing, habitat degradation, and disease outbreaks, the population of Ostrea edulis has declined in many regions, leading to conservation efforts and the establishment of sustainable aquaculture practices to maintain its availability and prevent further decline.",
