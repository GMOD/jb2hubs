  "description": "Falco peregrinus, commonly known as the peregrine falcon, is a species of raptor bird that is widely distributed across the globe. It is considered one of the fastest animals on Earth, capable of reaching speeds of over 320 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic high-speed dives, known as stoops, to catch its prey.\n\nThe peregrine falcon is a medium-sized bird of prey, with a length of 34-58 cm (13-23 inches) and a wingspan of 80-120 cm (31-47 inches). It has a distinctive dark gray or black back, pale underparts, and a distinctive black \"helmet\" around its eyes. The species is known for its exceptional vision, which allows it to spot potential prey from great distances.\n\nPeregrine falcons are primarily found in urban and coastal areas, where they prey on a variety of small to medium-sized birds, such as pigeons, doves, and waterfowl. They are known for their impressive hunting techniques, using their speed and agility to outmaneuver their prey in the air.\n\nThe species is widely studied by scientists, as it serves as an important indicator of environmental health and has been the subject of successful conservation efforts in many parts of the world. Peregrine falcons are protected under various international and national laws, and their populations have recovered significantly in recent decades after a decline due to the use of pesticides in the mid-20th century.",
