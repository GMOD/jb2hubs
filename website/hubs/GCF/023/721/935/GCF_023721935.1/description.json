  "description": "Panthera uncia, commonly known as the snow leopard, is a large wild cat species native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is a member of the genus Panthera, which includes the lion, tiger, jaguar, and leopard.\n\nThe snow leopard is characterized by its thick, fur coat that is typically a grayish-white color with dark gray to black rosette-like markings. This coloration helps the animal camouflage effectively in its mountainous habitat, which is typically at high elevations ranging from 3,000 to 5,500 meters above sea level.\n\nAnatomically, the snow leopard has a robust and stocky build, with short legs and a long tail that helps it maintain balance on the steep, rocky terrain. Its broad paws act as natural snowshoes, and its nasal cavity is adapted to extract oxygen from the thin mountain air.\n\nAs a solitary and elusive predator, the snow leopard primarily hunts wild ungulates such as Himalayan blue sheep, Asiatic ibex, and Argali wild sheep. It is an adept climber and jumper, capable of leaping up to 15 meters horizontally and 6 meters vertically.\n\nThe snow leopard is classified as a \"Vulnerable\" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated global population of 4,000 to 6,500 individuals. Threats to its survival include habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.",
