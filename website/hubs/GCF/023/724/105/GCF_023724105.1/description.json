  "description": "Carassius gibelio, commonly known as the Prussian carp or silver crucian carp, is a freshwater fish species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. It is native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and parts of Russia, and has been introduced to various regions globally.\n\nCarassius gibelio is a relatively small-to-medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 40 centimeters (16 inches). It has a distinctive, robust, and deep-bodied appearance, with a rounded snout and a single pair of barbels. The fish's scales are large and thick, with a silvery-gray or golden-yellow coloration, often with a reddish tinge on the fins.\n\nCarassius gibelio is known for its high adaptability and resilience, allowing it to thrive in a wide range of aquatic habitats, including lakes, ponds, rivers, and slow-moving streams. It is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of aquatic plants, algae, and small invertebrates.\n\nThe species is of particular interest to fisheries and aquaculture due to its rapid growth, tolerance to poor water quality, and ability to reproduce parthenogenetically (without the involvement of males). Carassius gibelio has been widely introduced and has established invasive populations in many regions, where it can have significant ecological impacts on native fish communities.",
