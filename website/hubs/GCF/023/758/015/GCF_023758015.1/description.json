  "description": "Alternaria viburni is a species of fungus that belongs to the genus Alternaria. It is a plant pathogen that primarily infects the leaves and stems of viburnum plants, which are a genus of woody shrubs and trees.\n\nThe fungus produces dark-colored, septate hyphae and spore-bearing structures called conidiophores. The conidiophores give rise to multiple, obclavate (club-shaped) conidia (spores) that are characterized by their transverse and longitudinal septa, giving them a distinctive appearance.\n\nAlternaria viburni is known to cause a disease called Alternaria leaf spot or blight in viburnum plants. The symptoms of the disease include the formation of brown to black, irregular-shaped spots on the leaves, which can eventually lead to the premature defoliation of the plant.\n\nThe fungus is believed to overwinter in infected plant debris or on the surface of the plant, and it can spread through the dispersal of its airborne conidia. Proper management strategies, such as the use of resistant cultivars, proper sanitation, and the application of fungicides, may be necessary to control the disease caused by Alternaria viburni.",
