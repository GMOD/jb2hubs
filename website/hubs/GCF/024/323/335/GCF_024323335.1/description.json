It is an annual herbaceous plant that typically grows to a height of 60-120 cm. The plant has compound leaves with 1-3 pairs of leaflets and tendrils that help it climb and support its growth.\n\nThe flowers of Pisum sativum are typically white, pink, or purple, and they develop into long, green pods that contain multiple pea seeds. The pea seeds are the primary edible part of the plant and are commonly consumed as a vegetable in various cuisines around the world.\n\nPisum sativum is believed to have originated in the Middle East and has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is widely grown for its nutritional value, as peas are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The plant is also used as a cover crop and in crop rotation to improve soil fertility.\n\nBotanically, Pisum sativum is classified as a dicotyledonous plant, meaning it has two embryonic seed leaves or cotyledons. It is a member of the legume family, which is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules.",
