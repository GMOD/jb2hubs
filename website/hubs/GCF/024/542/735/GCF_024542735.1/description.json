  "description": "Bombus huntii, commonly known as the Hunt's bumblebee, is a species of bumblebee found in western North America. It belongs to the genus Bombus, a group of social insects within the order Hymenoptera.\n\nThe Hunt's bumblebee is a medium-sized bumblebee, typically measuring between 15-20 millimeters in length. It has a distinct coloration pattern, with a black body and orange-red abdominal segments. The thorax is covered in dense, velvety black hairs, while the legs and antennae are also black.\n\nBombus huntii is an important pollinator, feeding on a variety of flowering plants and contributing to the pollination of many wild and cultivated species. They are particularly well-adapted to alpine and subalpine environments, where they play a crucial role in the ecosystem.\n\nThe nests of the Hunt's bumblebee are typically underground, often in abandoned rodent burrows or other cavities. The colonies are relatively small, usually consisting of a single queen and a few dozen workers.\n\nLike other bumblebee species, Bombus huntii plays a vital role in maintaining the health and diversity of natural plant communities, making it an important component of the local ecology.",
