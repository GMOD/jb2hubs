  "description": "Macaca thibetana thibetana, also known as the Tibetan macaque, is a subspecies of the Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana) that is native to the mountainous regions of central China. This primate belongs to the family Cercopithecidae and the genus Macaca, which includes various species of Old World monkeys.\n\nMacaca thibetana thibetana is a medium-sized macaque, with a robust build and a distinctive golden-brown to reddish-brown fur coat. These monkeys have a well-developed brow ridge and a relatively short, rounded muzzle. They are known for their strong social bonds and their ability to live in large, complex social groups, often led by a dominant female.\n\nThe Tibetan macaque inhabits temperate forests, alpine meadows, and rocky areas at high elevations, typically ranging from 1,800 to 4,500 meters above sea level. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plant materials, including leaves, fruits, and seeds.\n\nThis subspecies is considered to be less threatened than the closely related Sichuan subspecies (Macaca thibetana huangshanensis), but it still faces conservation challenges due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting pressures in parts of its range. Efforts to protect and study this unique primate species are ongoing.",
