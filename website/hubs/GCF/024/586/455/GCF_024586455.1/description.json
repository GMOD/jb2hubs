  "description": "Bactrocera neohumeralis is a species of fruit fly belonging to the family Tephritidae. It is native to Australia and is considered a pest species, particularly affecting tropical and subtropical fruits.\n\nThe adult Bactrocera neohumeralis flies are approximately 6-8 millimeters in length, with a yellowish-brown body and dark markings on the wings. The head has distinctive features, including a pair of large, compound eyes and a proboscis used for feeding on plant juices and nectar.\n\nThe females of this species are capable of laying eggs directly into the flesh of ripe fruits, where the larvae (maggots) then feed and develop, causing significant damage to the fruit. This can result in reduced crop yields and make the affected fruits unfit for human consumption.\n\nBactrocera neohumeralis is known to target a variety of fruit crops, including mangoes, avocados, citrus, and other tropical and subtropical fruits. Its presence and impact on agricultural production have made it an important target for pest management strategies in affected regions.",
