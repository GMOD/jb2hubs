  "description": "Candida theae is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Candida. It was first isolated from the leaf surface of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) in Japan. Candida theae is a non-spore-forming, asexual, and unicellular fungus.\n\nMorphologically, Candida theae cells are oval to cylindrical in shape, and they reproduce by budding. The colonies formed by this yeast on culture media are typically creamy-white in color and have a smooth, glistening appearance.\n\nBiochemically, Candida theae is capable of assimilating and fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose. It can also grow in the presence of various nitrogen sources, such as nitrate and ammonium salts.\n\nEcologically, Candida theae is found as a commensal or epiphytic (living on the surface) yeast species associated with tea plants. Its presence on the leaf surface may contribute to the microbial diversity and dynamics of the tea plant microbiome, although its precise ecological role is not yet fully understood.\n\nFrom a biotechnological perspective, Candida theae has been studied for its potential applications in the food and beverage industries, particularly in the production of tea-related fermented products. However, further research is needed to fully explore its potential uses and benefits.",
