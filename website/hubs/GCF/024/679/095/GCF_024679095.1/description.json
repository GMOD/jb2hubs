  "description": "Eriocheir sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese mitten crab, is a species of freshwater crab native to East Asia. It is a medium-sized crab that can grow up to 10 cm in carapace width.\n\nThe key characteristics of Eriocheir sinensis are:\n\n1. Carapace: The carapace is square-shaped and brownish-green in color. It has four lateral spines on each side.\n\n2. Claws: The claws are large and covered in dense, fur-like setae, giving the appearance of \"mittens,\" hence the common name \"Chinese mitten crab.\"\n\n3. Habitat: The species is native to the coastal regions of China and Korea, living in estuaries, rivers, and lakes. It migrates between freshwater and marine environments to reproduce.\n\n4. Life Cycle: Eriocheir sinensis has a complex life cycle, involving larval stages in the sea and adult stages in freshwater. The crabs migrate downstream to the sea to breed, and the larvae develop in the marine environment before returning to freshwater as juveniles.\n\n5. Invasive Species: The Chinese mitten crab has been introduced to various parts of the world, including Europe and North America, where it has become an invasive species, causing ecological and economic problems.\n\n6. Ecological Importance: As a migratory, omnivorous species, the Chinese mitten crab plays a significant role in the food web, serving as both a predator and prey in its native and introduced habitats.\n\nOverall, Eriocheir sinensis is a unique and adaptable species that has attracted significant interest from ecologists, biologists, and resource managers due to its ecological and economic impacts.",
