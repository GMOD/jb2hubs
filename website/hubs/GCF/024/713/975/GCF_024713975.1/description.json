  "description": "Paralichthys olivaceus, commonly known as the olive flounder or Japanese flounder, is a species of large-tooth flounder found in the coastal waters of the northwestern Pacific Ocean. It is a commercially important flatfish species that is widely distributed in the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea.\n\nThe olive flounder is a typical right-eyed flounder, with both eyes located on the right side of the body. It has an elongated, oval-shaped body that is olive-green or brownish in color on the upper side, which helps it camouflage with the seafloor. The underside of the fish is white. It has a large mouth with well-developed teeth, which it uses to feed on a variety of prey, including small fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nParalichthys olivaceus is an important aquaculture species, with large-scale farming operations in countries such as China, Japan, and Korea. It is also a popular target for recreational and commercial fisheries in its native range. Conservation efforts are in place to manage the sustainable harvest of this species, which plays a significant role in the marine ecosystems and economies of the northwestern Pacific region.",
