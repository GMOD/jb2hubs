  "description": "Hippocampus zosterae, commonly known as the dwarf seahorse, is a small marine fish species belonging to the genus Hippocampus. It is found in the coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean, primarily along the coasts of the United States, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe dwarf seahorse is a diminutive species, typically reaching a maximum length of around 2.5 inches (6.4 cm). It has a distinctive horse-like head, a prehensile tail, and a compact, laterally compressed body. The species is characterized by its pale brown or yellowish-white coloration, which often blends with the seagrass and algae habitats it inhabits.\n\nDwarf seahorses are known for their unique reproductive behavior, in which the male carries the fertilized eggs in a specialized pouch on his abdomen until they hatch. This species is also known for its slow swimming capabilities and its ability to remain stationary, gripping onto seagrass or other aquatic vegetation with its prehensile tail.\n\nHippocampus zosterae is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to threats such as habitat loss, bycatch, and the international trade in seahorses for traditional medicine and the aquarium industry.",
