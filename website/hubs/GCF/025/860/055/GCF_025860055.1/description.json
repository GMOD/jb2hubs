  "description": "Xyrauchen texanus, commonly known as the razorback sucker, is a freshwater fish species native to the Colorado River basin in the southwestern United States. It is a member of the sucker family, Catostomidae, and is distinguished by its unique hump-backed appearance.\n\nThe razorback sucker can grow up to 24 inches (61 cm) in length and typically has a lifespan of 40-50 years. It is an omnivorous fish, feeding on algae, aquatic plants, and small invertebrates. The species is adapted to the swift, turbid waters of the Colorado River system and has developed specialized features, such as a large, fleshy, upturned mouth and a pronounced dorsal hump, which help it maintain its position in the strong currents.\n\nHistorically, the razorback sucker was abundant throughout the Colorado River basin, but its populations have declined significantly due to factors such as habitat loss, water diversions, and the introduction of non-native predatory fish species. As a result, the razorback sucker is considered an endangered species, and conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore its populations.",
