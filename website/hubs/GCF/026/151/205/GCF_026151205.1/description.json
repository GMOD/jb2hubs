  "description": "Bolinopsis microptera is a species of ctenophore, commonly known as a comb jelly, belonging to the phylum Ctenophora. Ctenophores are gelatinous, biradially symmetrical marine invertebrates that use a series of cilia-based combs for locomotion.\n\nBolinopsis microptera is a small-sized comb jelly, typically measuring around 2-4 centimeters in length. It has a rounded, ovoid body shape with a pair of large, wing-like lobes that are used for propulsion. The cilia-based combs, which give ctenophores their characteristic \"comb-like\" appearance, are present along the length of these lobes.\n\nThis species is found in various marine environments, primarily in coastal and open ocean regions. Bolinopsis microptera is a predatory comb jelly, feeding on a variety of small zooplankton and other microscopic organisms using its tentacles and oral lobes.\n\nLike other ctenophores, Bolinopsis microptera has a unique mode of reproduction, which involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization and development occur. The resulting larvae undergo a series of transformations before reaching the adult stage.\n\nBolinopsis microptera is an important component of marine ecosystems, playing a role in the overall energy flow and nutrient cycling within the food web.",
