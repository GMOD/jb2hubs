  "description": "Hylaeus volcanicus is a species of bee belonging to the genus Hylaeus, also known as the masked bees or yellow-faced bees. This species is native to the Hawaiian islands and is found predominantly on the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nHylaeus volcanicus is a small, solitary bee that measures approximately 5-7 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive yellow or cream-colored face, which is the origin of the common name \"yellow-faced bee.\" The rest of the body is mostly black in color, with some yellow or white markings on the thorax and abdomen.\n\nThese bees are important pollinators in the Hawaiian ecosystem, contributing to the reproduction of various native plant species. They nest in small cavities, such as in dead wood or hollow stems, and collect pollen and nectar to provision their nests and feed their young.\n\nThe species name \"volcanicus\" refers to the fact that Hylaeus volcanicus is often found in areas with volcanic activity or near volcanic features, such as lava flows and cinder cones. This adaptation allows the bees to thrive in the unique and sometimes harsh environmental conditions of the Hawaiian islands.",
