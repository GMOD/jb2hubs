It belongs to the family Uloboridae, known as crab spiders or feather-legged spiders.\n\nThe key characteristics of Uloborus diversus are as follows:\n\n1. Size: Typically, the body length of Uloborus diversus ranges from 3 to 6 millimeters.\n\n2. Appearance: These spiders have a compact, rounded body shape. Their legs are relatively long compared to their body size. Their coloration can vary, ranging from shades of gray to brown, often with patterns of darker markings on the abdomen.\n\n3.
