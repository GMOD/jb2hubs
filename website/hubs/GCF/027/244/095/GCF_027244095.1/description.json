  "description": "Hemicordylus capensis, commonly known as the Cape girdled lizard, is a species of lizard belonging to the family Cordylidae. It is endemic to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa.\n\nThe Cape girdled lizard is a medium-sized lizard, typically measuring between 15 to 25 centimeters in length. It has a robust, flattened body with a distinct dorsal crest along its back. The lizard's scales are heavily keeled, giving it a rough and spiny appearance. Its coloration varies from dark brown to reddish-brown, with darker bands or patterns across its body.\n\nThis species is a terrestrial, rock-dwelling lizard that primarily inhabits rocky outcrops, cliffs, and mountainous areas. It is an adept climber and often basking on exposed rocks during the day. The Cape girdled lizard is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and scorpions, as well as plant matter.\n\nHemicordylus capensis is known for its unique defense mechanism, where it can detach its tail when threatened, allowing it to escape predators. The tail can then regenerate over time. This species is generally considered to be of Least Concern in terms of conservation status, but its populations may be affected by habitat loss and fragmentation due to human activities.",
