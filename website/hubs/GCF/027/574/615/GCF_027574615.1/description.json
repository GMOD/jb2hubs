It is a nocturnal species, emerging at dusk to forage for its prey. The big brown bat is known for its ability to navigate and locate its prey using echolocation, emitting high-frequency calls and listening for the returning echoes.\n\nThis species is often found roosting in buildings, caves, and tree cavities, and can form large colonies during the summer months. Eptesicus fuscus is an important part of the ecosystem, as it helps to control insect populations and plays a role in the dispersal of seeds and pollination of plants.",
