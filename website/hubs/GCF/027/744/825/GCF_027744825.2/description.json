It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, typically inhabiting coral reef environments.\n\nThe Mandarinfish is known for its striking and vibrant coloration, with a combination of blues, oranges, yellows, and whites in intricate patterns. This unique appearance has made it a popular choice in the aquarium trade. The fish has a relatively small size, usually reaching a maximum length of around 7-10 centimeters.\n\nBehaviorally, the Mandarinfish is known to be territorial and can be observed engaging in courtship displays and mating rituals, often in the evening hours.
