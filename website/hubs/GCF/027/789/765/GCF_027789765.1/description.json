  "description": "Dendropsophus ebraccatus, commonly known as the thin-legged treefrog or the banded treefrog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Hylidae. It is native to Central America, found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.\n\nThis species is a small treefrog, with a snout-vent length typically ranging from 18 to 25 millimeters. It has slender limbs and long, thin fingers and toes, which are adapted for climbing and moving through the vegetation. The skin is smooth, and the coloration is variable, ranging from shades of green, brown, or gray, often with dark bands or markings on the body and limbs.\n\nDendropsophus ebraccatus is arboreal, spending most of its time in the canopy of trees and shrubs. It is primarily nocturnal and emerges at night to forage for small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders. The species reproduces by laying eggs in temporary or permanent water bodies, and the tadpoles undergo metamorphosis to transform into juvenile frogs.\n\nThis treefrog is widely distributed and relatively common throughout its range, and it is not considered a threatened species. However, like many amphibians, it may face potential threats from habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.",
