  "description": "Emys orbicularis, commonly known as the European pond turtle or the European pond terrapin, is a freshwater turtle species native to Europe and parts of Western Asia. It belongs to the family Emydidae, which includes various pond and marsh turtles.\n\nEmys orbicularis is a medium-sized turtle, with a carapace (upper shell) that can reach up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. The carapace is typically oval-shaped and has a slightly domed appearance. The color of the carapace can vary from dark brown to black, with distinctive yellow or orange markings on the scutes (scales) of the shell.\n\nThe plastron (lower shell) of Emys orbicularis is generally yellow or light brown in color, with a hinged design that allows the turtle to partially withdraw its head, legs, and tail into its shell for protection. The skin of the head, neck, and limbs is typically dark brown or black, with yellow or orange markings.\n\nThese turtles are primarily aquatic and can be found in a variety of freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, slow-moving rivers, and marshes. They are adept swimmers and often bask on logs, rocks, or the shores of their aquatic environments. Their diet consists of a variety of aquatic plants, small invertebrates, and even small vertebrates.\n\nEmys orbicularis is considered a long-lived species, with some individuals living up to 80 years or more in the wild. They are an important part of the aquatic ecosystems they inhabit, serving as both predators and prey within the food chain.",
