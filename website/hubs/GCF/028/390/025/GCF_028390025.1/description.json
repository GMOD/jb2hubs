  "description": "Pseudophryne corroboree, commonly known as the Corroboree Frog, is a small, terrestrial frog species native to the Australian Alps region of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the genus Pseudophryne, which is a group of small, ground-dwelling frogs found in Australia and New Guinea.\n\nThe Corroboree Frog is characterized by its distinctive black and yellow striped pattern, which serves as a warning coloration to predators. It has a stocky build, with short limbs and a rounded body. The species is relatively small, measuring around 2-3 inches in length from snout to vent.\n\nPseudophryne corroboree is found in subalpine and alpine environments, typically in damp, mossy areas and along the edges of streams and bogs. It is primarily nocturnal and feeds on a variety of small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders.\n\nThe Corroboree Frog is known for its unique breeding behavior, which involves the male calling from small depressions or burrows in the ground to attract females. After mating, the female lays her eggs in the burrow, where they develop and hatch without the need for a tadpole stage.\n\nDue to habitat loss, climate change, and the spread of the amphibian chytrid fungus, the Corroboree Frog is considered a critically endangered species and is the focus of extensive conservation efforts in Australia.",
