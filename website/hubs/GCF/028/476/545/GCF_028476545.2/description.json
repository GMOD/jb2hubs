  "description": "Physella acuta, also known as the acute bladder snail or the European ear snail, is a species of freshwater snail that belongs to the family Physidae. It is a small, sinistral (left-handed) gastropod mollusk that inhabits various aquatic habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.\n\nPhysella acuta is characterized by its thin, ovate-conical shell, which is typically pale brown or greyish in color. The shell has a relatively large, inflated body whorl and a short, pointed spire. The aperture of the shell is large and wide, with a simple, thin lip. The snail's soft body is typically dark grey or blackish in color, with a well-developed mantle that can partially cover the shell.\n\nThis species is known for its high adaptability and can thrive in a wide range of aquatic environments, including those with varying levels of pollution and disturbance. Physella acuta is an important component of freshwater ecosystems, as it plays a role in the decomposition of organic matter and serves as a food source for various predators, such as fish, birds, and amphibians.",
