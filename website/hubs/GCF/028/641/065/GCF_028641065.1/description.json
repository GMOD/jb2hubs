  "description": "Leucoraja erinaceus, commonly known as the thornback ray or thornback skate, is a species of cartilaginous fish belonging to the family Rajidae, which includes various ray and skate species.\n\nThe thornback ray is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, ranging from the English Channel to the Mediterranean Sea. It is characterized by its distinctive dorsal surface covered in small, sharp, thornlike denticles, which gives it a spiny or \"thorny\" appearance, hence the common name.\n\nThis species typically grows to a maximum size of around 80 cm in length and is known to inhabit coastal and continental shelf waters, often preferring sandy or muddy seabeds. Thornback rays are bottom-dwelling predators, feeding primarily on small bony fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.\n\nReproduction in the thornback ray involves internal fertilization, and the females give birth to live young, known as ovoviviparous development. The species is considered to be of least concern on the IUCN Red List, though it may face threats from commercial and recreational fishing activities within its geographic range.",
