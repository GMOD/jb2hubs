  "description": "Symphalangus syndactylus, commonly known as the siamang, is a species of gibbon native to the forests of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. It is the largest of the gibbons, with an average body length of around 90 cm and a weight of up to 12 kg.\n\nThe siamang is characterized by its distinctive physical features, such as its black fur, a large inflatable throat sac, and the fusion of the second and third fingers on each hand, which gives it its scientific name (\"syndactylus\" meaning \"fused fingers\"). This adaptation helps the siamang to swing through the forest canopy with great agility and speed.\n\nSiamangs are highly social and arboreal primates, living in small family groups and engaging in complex vocalizations, including their famous loud, resonating calls that can be heard up to 3 km away. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and flowers.\n\nThe siamang is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat loss and hunting, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique and fascinating species of gibbon.",
