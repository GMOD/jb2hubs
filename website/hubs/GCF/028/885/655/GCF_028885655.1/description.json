  "description": "Pongo abelii, commonly known as the Sumatran orangutan, is a species of great ape native to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is one of the three extant species of the genus Pongo, the other two being the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis).\n\nThe Sumatran orangutan is a large, arboreal primate characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown fur, long arms, and intelligent, solitary nature. They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of fruits, leaves, and other plant materials. Sumatran orangutans are known for their exceptional tool-making abilities and their complex social behaviors, which include a sophisticated communication system and the ability to construct elaborate nests in the trees.\n\nThese primates are classified as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss, deforestation, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting the remaining populations and their fragile tropical forest habitats in Sumatra.",
