  "description": "Apis cerana, commonly known as the Eastern honeybee or Asian honeybee, is a species of honeybee native to Southeast Asia. It is a close relative of the more well-known Western honeybee (Apis mellifera).\n\nApis cerana is a medium-sized honeybee, typically measuring around 12-15 millimeters in length. It has a distinctive yellow and black striped abdomen, and its body is covered in fine, golden-colored hairs. The species is known for its ability to build nests in various natural cavities, such as tree hollows, rock crevices, and even human-made structures like abandoned buildings.\n\nOne of the key adaptations of Apis cerana is its ability to defend its hive against predators, including the infamous Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia). The bees can collectively swarm and attack the hornets, using their body heat to raise the temperature within the hive and suffocate the invaders.\n\nApis cerana plays a crucial role in the ecosystem as a pollinator, contributing to the reproduction of various plant species in its native range. The species is also of economic importance, as it is widely managed for honey production in many Asian countries.\n\nIn recent years, Apis cerana has been the subject of increased research and conservation efforts, as the species faces threats from factors such as habitat loss, pesticide use, and competition from the more aggressive Western honeybee in some areas.",
