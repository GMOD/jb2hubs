  "description": "Salvelinus fontinalis, commonly known as the brook trout or speckled trout, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the char (Salvelinus) genus of the salmon family Salmonidae. It is native to eastern North America, where it is found in cold, clear streams, rivers, and lakes.\n\nThe brook trout is a small to medium-sized fish, typically ranging from 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) in length, with a maximum recorded length of around 24 inches (61 cm). It has a distinctive, brightly colored appearance, with a dark green or brown back, a white belly, and distinctive vermiculate (worm-like) patterns and red spots with blue halos along its sides.\n\nBrook trout are cold-water, bottom-dwelling fish that prefer clear, well-oxygenated waters with a gravel or rocky substrate. They are opportunistic feeders, preying on a variety of aquatic insects, small fish, and crustaceans. Brook trout are known for their sensitivity to environmental changes and pollution, making them an indicator species for the health of aquatic ecosystems.\n\nDue to their popularity as a sport fish and the impacts of habitat degradation, overfishing, and invasive species, the brook trout has experienced population declines in parts of its native range. Conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and stocking programs, have been undertaken to protect and maintain healthy brook trout populations.",
