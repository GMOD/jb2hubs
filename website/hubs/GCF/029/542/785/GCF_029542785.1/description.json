  "description": "Malassezia japonica is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Malassezia. It is a lipophilic, or fat-loving, organism that is commonly found on the skin of humans and other animals.\n\nMalassezia japonica is a member of the Malassezia genus, which is a group of fungi that are known to be associated with various skin conditions, such as seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and atopic dermatitis. These yeasts are thought to play a role in the development of these skin conditions, although the exact mechanisms are not fully understood.\n\nMalassezia japonica was first isolated from the skin of healthy Japanese individuals in 2007. It is considered to be a relatively newly identified species within the Malassezia genus, and its distribution and prevalence on the human skin is still being studied.\n\nLike other Malassezia species, Malassezia japonica is capable of producing lipases, which are enzymes that break down lipids or fats. This ability allows the yeast to utilize the lipids present on the skin surface as a source of nutrients for growth and proliferation.\n\nOverall, Malassezia japonica is an important member of the skin microbiome, and its role in skin health and disease is an active area of research.",
