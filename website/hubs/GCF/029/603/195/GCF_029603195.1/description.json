  "description": "Condylostylus longicornis is a species of long-legged fly (family Dolichopodidae) known for its distinctive elongated antennae. This small insect, typically measuring around 5-7 millimeters in length, is characterized by its slender, elongated body and legs, as well as its unique antennal structures.\n\nThe antennae of Condylostylus longicornis are particularly noteworthy, as they are significantly longer than the insect's head, often extending to a considerable length. This feature is believed to play a role in the species' courtship and communication behaviors, potentially serving as a visual signal or sensory organ.\n\nTaxonomically, Condylostylus longicornis belongs to the genus Condylostylus, which is a diverse group of long-legged flies found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is widely distributed, with records from various parts of the Americas, including North, Central, and South America.\n\nThese flies are generally considered to be beneficial insects, as they play a role in the ecosystem by preying on smaller invertebrates, such as mosquitoes and other small flies. Their long legs and agile movements allow them to effectively capture and consume their prey.\n\nOverall, Condylostylus longicornis is a unique and interesting member of the long-legged fly family, with its distinctive antennal structures and ecological significance within its native habitats.",
