  "description": "Microplitis mediator is a species of parasitoid wasp that belongs to the family Braconidae. It is a small insect, typically measuring around 3-5 millimeters in length.\n\nMicroplitis mediator is an endoparasitoid, meaning that its larvae develop internally within the host, which in this case is the caterpillar of various moth species. The adult female wasp lays her eggs inside the host caterpillar, and the larva then feeds on the host's internal tissues, ultimately killing the caterpillar as it matures.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe and Asia, and it plays an important role in the natural regulation of some agricultural pest species, such as the cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) and the cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae). As a result, Microplitis mediator is sometimes used in biological control programs to help manage these pest insects in agricultural systems.\n\nThe life cycle and behavioral characteristics of Microplitis mediator have been extensively studied, as it serves as a model organism for understanding the ecology and evolution of parasitoid-host interactions.",
