  "description": "Yezo virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. It is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks, particularly those of the Haemaphysalis and Ixodes genera.\n\nThe Yezo virus was first isolated in 1972 from the blood of sentinel cattle in the Yezo district of Hokkaido, Japan. It is primarily found in certain regions of Asia, including Japan, China, and South Korea, where it can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts, such as livestock and small mammals.\n\nInfection with the Yezo virus can cause a febrile illness in humans, with symptoms that may include headache, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal disturbances. However, the overall public health impact of this virus is considered relatively low compared to other tick-borne viruses.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology, ecology, and potential clinical implications of Yezo virus infections in affected regions.",
