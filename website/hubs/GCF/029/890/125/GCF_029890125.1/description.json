  "description": "Rhinichthys klamathensis goyatoka is a subspecies of the Klamath dace, a small freshwater fish found in the Klamath River basin of Oregon and California, United States. It is a member of the Cyprinidae family, commonly known as the carp and minnow family.\n\nThe Rhinichthys klamathensis goyatoka is a small, slender fish with a rounded snout and a subterminal mouth. It typically has a dark olive-brown or gray back, with a lighter belly and sides. This subspecies is distinguished from the nominal subspecies, Rhinichthys klamathensis klamathensis, by its smaller average size and slightly different meristic characteristics, such as the number of scales and fin rays.\n\nThe Rhinichthys klamathensis goyatoka inhabits cool, clear streams and rivers, often in areas with riffles and moderate current. It feeds primarily on algae, aquatic plants, and small invertebrates. The subspecies is important in the local ecosystem, serving as a food source for larger predatory fish and wildlife.\n\nConservation efforts are in place to protect the Rhinichthys klamathensis goyatoka, as its habitat has been threatened by various human activities, such as water diversion, pollution, and habitat degradation. Ongoing monitoring and management strategies are crucial for the long-term survival of this unique subspecies within the Klamath River basin.",
