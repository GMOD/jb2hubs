  "description": "Ochotona princeps, commonly known as the American pika, is a small mammal species belonging to the order Lagomorpha, which includes rabbits and hares. It is a member of the family Ochotonidae, the pika family.\n\nThe American pika is a small, stout-bodied animal, typically measuring around 15-20 cm in length and weighing approximately 120-160 grams. It has a rounded body, short legs, and large, rounded ears. Its fur is typically gray or brown in color, providing camouflage in its natural rocky, alpine habitats.\n\nPikas are known for their unique behavior and adaptations to the harsh environments they inhabit. They are found in mountainous regions of western North America, living in talus slopes, rocky crevices, and other areas with abundant cover. Pikas are herbivores, primarily feeding on a variety of grasses, sedges, and other alpine vegetation.\n\nOne of the most distinctive features of the American pika is its ability to survive in cold, high-altitude environments. Pikas are well-adapted to the cold, with their dense fur and the ability to maintain a high body temperature. They are also known for their unique behavior of collecting and storing vegetation for the winter, creating \"haystacks\" that they use as a food source during the colder months.\n\nPikas are considered a keystone species in their ecosystem, playing an important role in the food web and influencing the surrounding plant and animal communities. They are also considered an indicator species, as their presence or absence can provide information about the overall health and condition of their habitat.",
