  "description": "Musca domestica, commonly known as the common house fly, is a species of fly that belongs to the family Muscidae. It is one of the most widely distributed and well-known insects in the world, found in almost every corner of the globe.\n\nThe house fly is a small, approximately 6-8 millimeters long, grayish-brown insect with a spongy, proboscis-like mouthpart. Its body is covered with fine hairs, and it has a pair of membranous wings that allow it to fly rapidly and maneuver easily. The compound eyes of the house fly are large and well-developed, providing them with a wide field of vision.\n\nHouse flies are known for their versatile feeding habits, as they can consume a wide range of organic matter, including decaying plant and animal matter, human and animal feces, and various types of food. This adaptability has allowed them to thrive in close proximity to human habitats, making them a common household pest.\n\nMusca domestica is of particular importance due to its potential to transmit various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, that can cause diseases in humans and animals. Their ability to quickly spread from one contaminated surface to another, combined with their prolific breeding capabilities, makes them a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.",
