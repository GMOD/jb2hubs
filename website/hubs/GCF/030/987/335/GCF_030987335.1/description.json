  "description": "Cornus florida, commonly known as the flowering dogwood, is a deciduous tree species native to eastern North America. It belongs to the dogwood family, Cornaceae. \n\nThe Cornus florida tree typically grows to a height of 15-30 feet (4.5-9 meters) and has a spreading, horizontal branching habit. The leaves are simple, ovate, and dark green in color, turning red, purple, or pink in the fall. \n\nThe most distinctive feature of this species is its showy, four-bracted \"flowers\" that appear in the spring before the leaves emerge. These \"flowers\" are actually modified bracts (leaf-like structures) that surround the small, greenish-yellow true flowers. The bracts can be white, pink, or red in color, depending on the cultivar.\n\nCornus florida produces clusters of red, oval-shaped drupes (stone fruits) in the late summer and fall, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. The tree's wood is hard and dense, and has been used for various purposes, including as an ornamental and in the production of woodenware.\n\nThis species is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree for its spring flowers and attractive autumn foliage. It is also an important component of many forest ecosystems in its native range, playing a role in the structure and functioning of those communities.",
