  "description": "Gadus macrocephalus, commonly known as the Pacific cod or gray cod, is a species of cod fish belonging to the family Gadidae. It is native to the northern Pacific Ocean, with a range that extends from the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea in the north to the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea in the south.\n\nThe Pacific cod is a demersal fish, living and feeding near the seafloor. It has a robust, elongated body with a large, broad head and a distinctive barbel (a whisker-like appendage) on its chin. The species is typically grayish-brown in color, with a lighter underside. It can grow up to a maximum length of around 1 meter, although the average size is typically between 30-60 cm.\n\nPacific cod are important commercially, with a significant fishery in the North Pacific. They are harvested for their white, flaky flesh, which is highly valued for its taste and texture. The species plays a crucial role in the marine ecosystems of the North Pacific, serving as a prey item for various predators, including seals, whales, and larger fish.",
