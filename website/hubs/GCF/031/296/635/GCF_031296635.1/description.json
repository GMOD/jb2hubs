  "description": "Actinomyces acetigenes is a species of gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the Actinomycetales order. It is a member of the Actinomycetaceae family, which is known for its diverse group of bacteria found in various environmental niches, including soil, water, and the human microbiome.\n\nActinomyces acetigenes is characterized by its ability to produce acetic acid as a primary metabolic byproduct, hence the specific epithet \"acetigenes.\" The cells of this species are typically rod-shaped and can form branching filaments, a characteristic common among Actinomyces species.\n\nThis bacterium is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various clinical conditions, such as actinomycosis, a chronic and progressive infectious disease that can affect different parts of the body, including the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen.\n\nActinomyces acetigenes is known to be a slow-growing bacterium and can be challenging to isolate and cultivate in the laboratory setting. Its specific growth requirements and potential interactions with other microorganisms in the human microbiome are still being actively investigated by researchers.",
