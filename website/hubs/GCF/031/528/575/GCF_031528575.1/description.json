  "description": "Candidatus Sororendozoicomonas aggregata is a recently discovered bacterial species that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It was first identified and characterized through metagenomics analysis of samples collected from a marine sponge species.\n\nThis bacterium is considered a candidate species, meaning it has not been formally described and classified yet, but its genomic and phylogenetic evidence suggest it represents a distinct bacterial lineage.\n\nThe name \"Candidatus Sororendozoicomonas aggregata\" reflects its observed characteristics. \"Sororendozoicomonas\" refers to its close association with the sponge host, while \"aggregata\" indicates its tendency to form aggregates or clusters.\n\nGenomic analysis suggests that Candidatus Sororendozoicomonas aggregata is an obligate endosymbiont, meaning it lives and thrives within the cells of the host sponge. It appears to have a relatively small genome, indicative of an evolutionary adaptation to the stable, nutrient-rich environment provided by the sponge host.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the specific metabolic capabilities, ecological roles, and evolutionary relationships of this candidate bacterial species within the complex sponge microbiome.",
