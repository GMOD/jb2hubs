  "description": "Aequorivita marina is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aequorivita marina was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of South Korea.\n\nCells of Aequorivita marina are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.4-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. They are motile and possess gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30°C, and it can tolerate a wide range of salinity, growing well in media containing 2-8% NaCl.\n\nAequorivita marina is an oxidase-positive and catalase-positive bacterium. It can hydrolyze a variety of substrates, including starch, casein, and Tween 80. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that Aequorivita marina is closely related to other members of the genus Aequorivita, which are commonly found in marine environments.\n\nThe ecological role and specific functions of Aequorivita marina in the marine ecosystem are not yet fully understood, but it is likely involved in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the ocean.",
