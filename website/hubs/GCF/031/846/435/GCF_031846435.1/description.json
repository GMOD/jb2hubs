  "description": "Croceicoccus esteveae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Spain. The cells of C. esteveae are coccoid in shape and stain Gram-positive. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are orange-yellow in color, which is the basis for its species name, \"esteveae.\"\n\nPhylogenetically, C. esteveae is closely related to other members of the genus Croceicoccus, which are known to be aerobic, non-spore-forming, and oxidase-positive. The optimal growth temperature for C. esteveae is reported to be around 30Â°C, and it can grow in the presence of up to 5% NaCl.\n\nBiochemically, C. esteveae is able to hydrolyze starch and casein, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources. The G+C content of its genomic DNA is approximately 71 mol%, which is characteristic of the Actinobacteria.\n\nOverall, Croceicoccus esteveae is a distinct bacterial species within the Actinobacteria phylum, characterized by its unique orange-yellow pigmentation and physiological properties.",
