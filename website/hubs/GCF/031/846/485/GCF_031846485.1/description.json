  "description": "Autumnicola tepida is a species of freshwater snail belonging to the family Physidae. It is found in various regions of North America, including the eastern and central parts of the United States.\n\nThis snail is typically small, with a shell diameter ranging from 5 to 10 millimeters. The shell is thin, fragile, and typically has a light brown or yellowish-brown coloration. The shell is also relatively smooth, with a rounded or ovate shape.\n\nAutumnicola tepida is considered a temperate species, preferring cooler, slow-moving or stagnant freshwater habitats, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It is often found clinging to aquatic vegetation, submerged logs, or other substrates within these aquatic environments.\n\nLike other physid snails, Autumnicola tepida is a hermaphroditic species, meaning each individual possesses both male and female reproductive organs. It reproduces by laying clusters of small, gelatinous egg masses, which are typically attached to underwater surfaces.\n\nThis species plays a role in the aquatic ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators, such as fish, birds, and other invertebrates. Additionally, Autumnicola tepida may contribute to the cycling of nutrients and the maintenance of healthy aquatic habitats through its grazing and decomposition activities.",
