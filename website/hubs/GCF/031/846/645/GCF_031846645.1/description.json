  "description": "Autumnicola psychrophila is a species of freshwater snail that belongs to the family Pleuroceridae. It is found in the eastern United States, primarily in streams and rivers with cool, well-oxygenated waters.\n\nThis snail is typically small, with a shell diameter of around 5-10 mm. The shell is conical in shape, with a pointed apex and a rounded body whorl. The shell surface is smooth and may have a light to dark brown coloration.\n\nAutumnicola psychrophila is adapted to live in cold, fast-flowing water environments. It is considered a \"psychrophilic\" species, meaning it thrives in cooler temperatures, typically between 10-20Â°C. The snail uses its operculum, a horny structure that can seal the shell opening, to prevent desiccation and maintain its aquatic habitat.\n\nAs a grazer, Autumnicola psychrophila feeds on periphyton, a community of algae, bacteria, and other microorganisms that grow on submerged surfaces. It plays a role in the aquatic ecosystem by converting primary production into a form that can be consumed by higher trophic levels.\n\nThe distribution and population status of Autumnicola psychrophila are important indicators of the overall health and water quality of the streams and rivers it inhabits. Its presence can be used as a bioindicator for assessing the ecological conditions of these freshwater environments.",
