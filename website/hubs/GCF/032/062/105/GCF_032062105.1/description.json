  "description": "Saccostrea cucullata, commonly known as the rock oyster or hooded oyster, is a species of edible oyster that belongs to the family Ostreidae. It is found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of coastal regions in the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe shell of Saccostrea cucullata is typically small, irregular in shape, and variable in color, ranging from white to gray, brown, or black. The upper valve (left valve) is often curved or hooded, giving the oyster a distinctive appearance. The lower valve (right valve) is more flat and adheres to the substrate, such as rocks, mangrove roots, or other hard surfaces.\n\nSaccostrea cucullata is a filter-feeding bivalve mollusk that feeds on microscopic plankton and organic particles suspended in the water column. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing food and habitat for a variety of other marine organisms.\n\nThis species is commercially important in some regions, where it is harvested for human consumption. However, it is also susceptible to various environmental stressors, such as pollution, changes in water temperature, and ocean acidification, which can impact its survival and population dynamics.",
