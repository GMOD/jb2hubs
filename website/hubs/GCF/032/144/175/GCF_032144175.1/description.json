  "description": "Bacteroides koreensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that was first isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract in South Korea. It is a member of the genus Bacteroides, which are commonly found in the human gut microbiome and play important roles in nutrient metabolism and immune system regulation.\n\nBacteroides koreensis is a non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium. It is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, to produce short-chain fatty acids as end products. The optimal growth conditions for this species are at a temperature of 37Â°C and a neutral pH.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Bacteroides koreensis is closely related to other Bacteroides species found in the human gut, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. This species is considered to be a commensal bacterium and is believed to contribute to the overall health and stability of the gut microbiome.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the specific functional roles and potential clinical implications of Bacteroides koreensis within the human gut ecosystem.",
