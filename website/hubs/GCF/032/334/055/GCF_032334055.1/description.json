  "description": "Anaeroselena agilis is a species of anaerobic, motile bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment.\n\nSome key characteristics of Anaeroselena agilis:\n\n1. Anaerobic: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Motility: Anaeroselena agilis is a motile bacterium, capable of moving using flagella.\n\n3. Cell morphology: The cells are slender, rod-shaped, and approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length.\n\n4. Habitat: It was originally isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystem, indicating its ability to thrive in such extreme, high-pressure, and energy-rich environments.\n\n5. Metabolism: Anaeroselena agilis is a chemolithoautotroph, meaning it can obtain energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds and use carbon dioxide as its sole carbon source for growth.\n\n6. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Anaeroselena agilis is classified within the Firmicutes phylum, specifically within the Clostridia class.\n\nThis species provides insights into the diversity of anaerobic microorganisms that inhabit deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, and its unique metabolic capabilities contribute to our understanding of the microbial processes occurring in these extreme environments.",
