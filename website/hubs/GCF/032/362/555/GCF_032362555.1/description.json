  "description": "Amyelois transitella, commonly known as the Naval Orangeworm, is a species of snout moth that belongs to the family Pyralidae. It is considered a significant agricultural pest, primarily affecting various nut crops such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.\n\nThe Naval Orangeworm is a small moth, with a wingspan ranging from 18 to 25 millimeters. The forewings are typically grayish-brown in color, with dark spots and irregular patterns that provide camouflage when the moth is at rest. The hindwings are pale gray or whitish.\n\nThe larvae of the Naval Orangeworm are the primary source of damage to nut crops. They bore into the nuts, feeding on the kernel and leaving behind frass (insect waste) and webbing, which can lead to contamination and reduced crop yields. The larvae undergo several instars (developmental stages) before pupating within the nut or in the soil.\n\nThe life cycle of the Naval Orangeworm is closely tied to the seasonal development of nut crops. They typically have multiple generations per year, with the number of generations varying depending on the geographic location and climate. Understanding the biology and ecology of this pest is crucial for the development of effective management strategies in agricultural settings.",
