  "description": "Brenneria uluponensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in Ulupona, Indonesia. It belongs to the genus Brenneria, which is a group of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic bacteria.\n\nThe cells of B. uluponensis are rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. The bacterium is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and maltose, as carbon sources for energy production.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that B. uluponensis is closely related to other Brenneria species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique biochemical and physiological characteristics. The species was first described in a scientific publication in 2014, following its isolation and identification from the soil samples.",
