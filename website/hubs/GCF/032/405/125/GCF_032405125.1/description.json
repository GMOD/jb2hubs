  "description": "Capricornis sumatraensis, commonly known as the Sumatran serow, is a species of goat-antelope found in the mountainous regions of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is a member of the Caprinae subfamily, which includes other species of goats, sheep, and antelope.\n\nThe Sumatran serow is a medium-sized, robust mammal, standing approximately 90-110 cm tall at the shoulder. It has a characteristic dark brown to black coat with a lighter-colored belly and muzzle. The animal's most distinctive feature is its short, curved horns, which are present in both males and females.\n\nSumatran serows are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, leaves, and other vegetation found in their mountainous habitat. They are known to be agile and nimble, navigating the steep, rugged terrain with ease.\n\nThese animals are typically solitary or found in small groups, and they are known to be relatively shy and elusive. They play an important role in the ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predators and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the Sumatran forests.\n\nThe Sumatran serow is classified as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting pressure. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique species and its natural environment.",
