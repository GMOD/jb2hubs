  "description": "Butyricimonas paravirosa is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Porphyromonadaceae.\n\nThe cells of Butyricimonas paravirosa are non-motile, rod-shaped, and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. They are typically found in pairs or short chains.\n\nThis species is classified as a strict anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It is also known to be saccharolytic, meaning it can utilize carbohydrates as a source of energy and carbon.\n\nButyricimonas paravirosa is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota in some animal hosts, where it may play a role in carbohydrate metabolism and the production of short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate. Its specific ecological function and interactions within the host's gut ecosystem are still under investigation.\n\nThe species was first isolated and described from the feces of a healthy human individual, and it has been detected in various other human and animal gut microbiome studies, though its prevalence and distribution can vary depending on the host and environmental factors.",
