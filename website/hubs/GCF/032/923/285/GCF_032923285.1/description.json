  "description": "Cobetia amphilecti is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Gammaproteobacteria class. It was first isolated from the marine sponge Amphilectus fucorum, found in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCobetia amphilecti is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is motile due to the presence of flagella. It is an aerobic organism, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. The bacterium is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Cobetia amphilecti is closely related to other members of the Cobetia genus, which are commonly found in marine environments. The genus Cobetia is characterized by its ability to produce exopolysaccharides, which are believed to play a role in the bacteria's interactions with their host organisms, such as sponges.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance and potential applications of Cobetia amphilecti, as well as its interactions with the marine sponge Amphilectus fucorum, from which it was originally isolated.",
