  "description": "Aestuariibaculum lutulentum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. Aestuariibaculum lutulentum was first isolated from tidal flat sediments in South Korea. It is an aerobic, chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires organic compounds as a carbon and energy source and uses oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor in its respiratory metabolism. The optimum growth temperature for Aestuariibaculum lutulentum is reported to be around 30Â°C, and it can tolerate a wide range of pH levels, from 6.0 to 9.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aestuariibaculum lutulentum is most closely related to other bacteria within the genus Aestuariibaculum, which are commonly found in marine and estuarine environments.",
