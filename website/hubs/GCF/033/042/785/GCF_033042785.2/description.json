  "description": "Bacteroides hominis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacteria that is commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. It is a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum and the Bacteroides genus, which are known to be dominant members of the human gut microbiome.\n\nBacteroides hominis is a rod-shaped bacterium that is typically 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. It is a strictly anaerobic microorganism, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. The bacterium is considered a commensal organism, as it is part of the normal and beneficial gut microbiota in healthy individuals.\n\nBacteroides hominis plays a role in the breakdown and fermentation of complex carbohydrates, such as dietary fibers, within the human intestine. This metabolic activity contributes to the overall gut health and the maintenance of a balanced microbial community. Additionally, Bacteroides hominis has been associated with the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can have beneficial effects on host physiology and immune function.\n\nWhile Bacteroides hominis is generally considered a non-pathogenic member of the gut microbiome, it has been occasionally isolated from clinical samples in cases of opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. However, its role in disease causation is not well-established, and it is primarily viewed as a commensal organism within the human gastrointestinal tract.",
