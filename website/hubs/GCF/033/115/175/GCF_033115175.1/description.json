  "description": "Lepus europaeus, commonly known as the European hare or brown hare, is a species of hare native to Europe and western Asia. It is a medium-sized mammal that belongs to the order Lagomorpha and the family Leporidae.\n\nThe European hare has a distinct brown or greyish-brown coat, which provides camouflage in its natural habitat. It has long, powerful hind legs, which allow it to run at high speeds to escape predators. The ears are long and erect, and the eyes are large and prominent, giving the hare excellent vision and hearing.\n\nThe European hare is a herbivorous species that feeds on a variety of vegetation, including grasses, herbs, and crops. It is known for its characteristic \"boxing\" behavior, where males engage in physical contests to establish dominance and compete for mates.\n\nLepus europaeus is an important game species in many regions and has been introduced to several countries outside its native range. However, its populations have declined in some areas due to habitat loss, hunting, and other environmental factors.",
