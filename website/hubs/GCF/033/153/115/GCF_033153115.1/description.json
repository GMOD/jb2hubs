  "description": "Saccostrea echinata, commonly known as the spiny rock oyster, is a species of oyster that belongs to the family Ostreidae. It is found in the coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from East Africa to the Philippines and northern Australia.\n\nThe species is characterized by its distinctive shell, which is typically round or oval in shape and covered with small, sharp spines or protrusions. This spiny surface helps the oyster adhere to rocky substrates and protects it from predators. The shell can grow up to 10 centimeters in diameter and is typically grayish or brownish in color.\n\nSaccostrea echinata is a filter-feeding bivalve mollusk that lives in the intertidal and subtidal zones, often in areas with strong wave action or water currents. It feeds by filtering plankton and other suspended particles from the surrounding water using its gills.\n\nThe species is known to be a prolific spawner, releasing millions of eggs and sperm into the water column during the spawning season. The larvae, known as veligers, drift in the water for several weeks before settling and metamorphosing into juvenile oysters.\n\nSaccostrea echinata is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for a variety of other marine organisms. It is also harvested for human consumption in some regions, though its spiny shell can make it difficult to handle and process.",
