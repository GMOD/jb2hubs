  "description": "Neopsephotus bourkii, commonly known as Bourke's parrot, is a small parrot species native to Australia. It belongs to the family Psittaculidae and is a member of the genus Neopsephotus.\n\nBourke's parrots are known for their compact and rounded body shape, with a short, hooked beak and relatively short tail. They typically measure around 18-20 cm in length. The plumage of these birds is predominantly pinkish-brown, with a blue-violet crown and cheeks, and a pale blue rump and underwing coverts. Females are generally duller in coloration compared to males.\n\nThese parrots inhabit semi-arid and arid regions of central and eastern Australia, where they can be found in open woodlands, scrublands, and grasslands. They feed primarily on a variety of seeds, grasses, and occasionally small insects.\n\nBourke's parrots are known for their social nature and often form small, close-knit flocks. They are relatively quiet compared to other parrot species and are considered relatively easy to keep in captivity, making them a popular choice among aviculturists and bird enthusiasts.",
