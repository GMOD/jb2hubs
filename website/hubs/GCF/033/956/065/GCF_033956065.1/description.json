  "description": "Burkholderia mallei is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium that is the causative agent of the infectious disease known as glanders. It is a highly pathogenic bacterium that primarily infects horses, mules, and donkeys, but can also be transmitted to humans, causing a serious and potentially fatal disease.\n\nB. mallei is a small, rod-shaped bacterium that is closely related to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis. It is an intracellular pathogen that can evade the host's immune system and replicate within macrophages and other host cells.\n\nThe bacterium is capable of causing various clinical manifestations in infected individuals, including localized skin lesions, pneumonia, septicemia, and chronic, debilitating infections. Glanders is considered a re-emerging infectious disease, particularly in regions where it is endemic, such as parts of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nDue to its high virulence and potential use as a biological weapon, B. mallei is classified as a Tier 1 select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, requiring strict safety and containment measures for its handling and study.",
