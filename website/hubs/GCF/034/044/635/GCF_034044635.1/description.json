  "description": "Dongia rigui is a species of bacteria that was isolated from water samples collected from a freshwater swamp forest in South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically the class Gammaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Dongia rigui are Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile. They are approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.3-2.0 μm in length. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dongia rigui is closely related to other members of the genus Dongia, which are typically found in aquatic environments. The genus Dongia is characterized by its ability to degrade various organic compounds and its potential roles in nutrient cycling in natural ecosystems.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological and ecological characteristics of Dongia rigui could provide insights into its specific functions and interactions within the freshwater swamp forest environment where it was initially discovered.",
