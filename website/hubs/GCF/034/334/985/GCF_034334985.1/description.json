  "description": "Acutalibacter intestini is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae. It is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nAcutalibacter intestini was first isolated from the human intestinal tract and has been found to be a member of the normal gut microbiome. It is considered a commensal bacterium, which means it lives in close association with its host (humans) without causing any known harm.\n\nThe genome of Acutalibacter intestini has been sequenced, and it has been observed to possess genes involved in the metabolism of complex carbohydrates, which suggests its potential role in the breakdown and fermentation of dietary fibers within the human gastrointestinal tract.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological and functional significance of Acutalibacter intestini within the human gut microbiome and its potential implications for human health.",
