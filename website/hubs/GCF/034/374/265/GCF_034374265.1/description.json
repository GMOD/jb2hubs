  "description": "Blastomonas marina is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Cytophagaceae. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium. Blastomonas marina is found in marine environments and was first isolated from seawater samples collected near the coast of Japan.\n\nThe cells of Blastomonas marina are typically non-motile, ovoid to rod-shaped, and measure approximately 0.8-1.5 μm in length and 0.4-0.7 μm in width. They reproduce by binary fission and form pale yellow, circular, and convex colonies on agar media.\n\nPhylogenetically, Blastomonas marina is classified within the phylum Bacteroidetes, which is known for its members' ability to degrade complex organic compounds, including polysaccharides and proteins. The genome of Blastomonas marina has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and ecological roles in marine ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Blastomonas marina is a common and ecologically significant bacterium found in marine environments, where it likely plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients.",
