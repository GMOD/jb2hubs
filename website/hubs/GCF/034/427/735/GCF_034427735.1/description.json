  "description": "Azohydromonas lata is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium with a characteristic rod-shaped morphology.\n\nSome key features of Azohydromonas lata:\n\n1. Metabolism: Azohydromonas lata is a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it derives its energy and carbon from organic compounds rather than inorganic sources.\n\n2. Nitrogen Fixation: This species is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, converting it into a form that can be utilized by plants and other organisms.\n\n3. Habitat: Azohydromonas lata is commonly found in soil and aquatic environments, where it plays a role in the nitrogen cycle.\n\n4. Identification: Azohydromonas lata can be identified through various microbiological techniques, such as colony morphology, biochemical tests, and molecular methods like 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n\n5. Significance: As a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, Azohydromonas lata can contribute to the fertility of soils and may have potential applications in agriculture or environmental remediation.\n\nOverall, Azohydromonas lata is a well-studied species that contributes to our understanding of bacterial diversity and their roles in nutrient cycling within natural ecosystems.",
