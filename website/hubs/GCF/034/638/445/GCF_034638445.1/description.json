  "description": "Ciconia boyciana, commonly known as the Oriental stork or Japanese white stork, is a large, white stork species found in East Asia. It is a member of the stork family, Ciconiidae.\n\nThe Oriental stork is a large bird, measuring around 100-115 cm in length, with a wingspan of 200-235 cm. It has a long, thick bill and long legs, which are both characteristic features of storks. The plumage is predominantly white, with black flight feathers and a black bill and legs.\n\nThis species is native to northeastern China, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan. It is considered critically endangered due to habitat loss and hunting pressure. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding and reintroduction programs, have been implemented to help increase the wild population.\n\nThe Oriental stork is a wetland-dependent species, preferring to nest in tall trees or on artificial platforms near marshes, swamps, and shallow lakes. It feeds on a variety of aquatic prey, such as fish, amphibians, and small reptiles.\n\nBreeding typically occurs in the spring, with pairs forming long-term pair bonds. The female lays 2-4 eggs, which are incubated for around 30-35 days. Both parents participate in the incubation and care of the chicks, which fledge after approximately 60-70 days.\n\nThe conservation status of the Oriental stork is critical, and ongoing efforts are essential to protect and restore this iconic species in its native range.",
