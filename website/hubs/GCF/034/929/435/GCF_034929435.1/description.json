  "description": "Arcicella rigui is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming rod-shaped bacterium. Arcicella rigui was first isolated from a freshwater wetland environment, specifically from a floating reed mat in a eutrophic reservoir located in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Arcicella rigui are approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They exhibit a characteristic gliding motility, which is a common feature among members of the Bacteroidetes phylum. The bacterium is considered psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow at a wide range of temperatures, including low temperatures.\n\nArcicella rigui is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as starch, xylan, and pectin, indicating its role in the decomposition of organic matter in its natural habitat. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Arcicella rigui is most closely related to other members of the genus Arcicella, which are commonly found in freshwater environments.\n\nThe ecological significance of Arcicella rigui lies in its potential contribution to the nutrient cycling and carbon dynamics within wetland ecosystems, where it may play a role in the degradation of complex organic compounds.",
