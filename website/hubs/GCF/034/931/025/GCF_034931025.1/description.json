  "description": "Arcicella gelida is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) and aerobic bacterium, meaning it thrives in cold environments and requires oxygen for growth.\n\nArcicella gelida was first isolated from a glacial ice sample collected in the Canadian Arctic. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. The cells are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species is known to be capable of growth at temperatures ranging from 0°C to 20°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 10°C. It is able to adapt to the cold conditions of its natural habitat, the glacial ice, by producing cold-adapted enzymes and other molecular mechanisms.\n\nArcicella gelida is considered a psychrophilic microorganism, as it is able to thrive in the low-temperature environments of the Arctic region. It plays a role in the nutrient cycling and microbial community dynamics within these icy ecosystems.",
