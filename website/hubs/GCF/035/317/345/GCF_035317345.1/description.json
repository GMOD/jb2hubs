  "description": "Cellvibrio fontiphilus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Cellvibrionaceae family. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium. Cellvibrio fontiphilus was first isolated from a freshwater spring in Japan.\n\nThe cells of Cellvibrio fontiphilus are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. They possess a single polar flagellum, which enables their motility. The optimal growth temperature for Cellvibrio fontiphilus is around 30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nCellvibrio fontiphilus is known to be able to degrade various polysaccharides, such as cellulose, xylan, and pectin, making it an important player in the decomposition of plant biomass in natural environments. Its ability to thrive in freshwater habitats, such as springs, suggests that it may play a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in these aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThe genome of Cellvibrio fontiphilus has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological functions. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of microbial diversity and their roles in various natural processes.",
