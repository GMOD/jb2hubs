  "description": "Carboxydochorda subterranea is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is an obligate anaerobic microorganism, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. This bacterium is known to be capable of chemolithoautotrophy, which is the ability to use carbon monoxide (CO) as a sole carbon and energy source, and to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) for biomass production.\n\nCarboxydochorda subterranea is found primarily in subsurface environments, such as deep underground or in aquifers, where it plays a role in the carbon and energy cycling processes. It is capable of tolerating and thriving in environments with low nutrient availability and high levels of carbon monoxide, which are typical characteristics of some subterranean habitats.\n\nThe genome of Carboxydochorda subterranea has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic pathways and adaptations to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of the microbial diversity and ecological functions in subsurface ecosystems.",
