  "description": "Scylla paramamosain, also known as the mud crab or the mangrove crab, is a species of crab that belongs to the family Portunidae. It is a large, edible crab that is commonly found in mangrove forests and estuarine environments across Southeast Asia and parts of the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe species is characterized by its broad, flattened carapace (upper shell) that can reach up to 16 cm in width. It has a distinctive pattern of nine teeth on the anterior (front) edge of the carapace, which is a key identifying feature. The legs of S. paramamosain are long and adapted for swimming, with the last pair of legs being paddle-like, enabling the crab to swim efficiently.\n\nS. paramamosain is an important commercial and subsistence species, prized for its sweet, tender meat. It plays a significant role in the ecosystem as a predator, feeding on a variety of smaller organisms, and as a prey item for larger predators. The species is also known to play a vital role in the nutrient cycling and energy flow within mangrove ecosystems.\n\nDue to its economic importance and the threats posed by habitat degradation, overexploitation, and climate change, S. paramamosain is the subject of various conservation and management efforts in its native range.",
