  "description": "Recurvomyces mirabilis is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a saprobic fungus, meaning it feeds on decaying organic matter. Recurvomyces mirabilis is characterized by its unique fruiting bodies, which are small, cup-shaped structures with a curved or \"recurved\" margin, giving it a distinctive appearance. The fungus produces ascospores, which are the sexual reproductive units, within the fruiting bodies. Microscopically, the ascospores are typically ellipsoid or fusiform in shape. Recurvomyces mirabilis is commonly found growing on decaying wood or other plant material in temperate and tropical regions around the world.",
