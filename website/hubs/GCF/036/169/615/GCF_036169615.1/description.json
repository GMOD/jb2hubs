  "description": "Heliangelus exortis, commonly known as the Napo Sunangel, is a species of hummingbird found in the eastern Andes of Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the genus Heliangelus, which includes several species of high-altitude hummingbirds.\n\nThe Napo Sunangel is a small hummingbird, measuring approximately 9-10 cm in length. It has a distinctive appearance, with a prominent forked tail, a long, slender bill, and a unique coloration. The male has a green crown, a glittering purple gorget (throat patch), and a brownish-green back, while the female is duller in appearance, with a grayish-green back and a pale throat.\n\nThese hummingbirds inhabit montane forests and forest edges at elevations ranging from 1,800 to 3,500 meters above sea level. They feed primarily on nectar, using their long bills to access the flowers of various plant species. The Napo Sunangel is known for its agile flight and its ability to hover for extended periods while foraging.\n\nThe species is considered Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), as it has a relatively wide distribution and is not facing significant threats at this time. However, habitat loss and fragmentation due to deforestation and human activities remain potential concerns for the long-term conservation of this high-altitude hummingbird.",
