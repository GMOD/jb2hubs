  "description": "Corallococcus caeni is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Corallococcus caeni was first isolated from activated sludge samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe cells of Corallococcus caeni are typically coccoid or slightly elongated in shape, with a diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 Î¼m. They are motile, with the presence of polar flagella. The colonies formed by Corallococcus caeni on agar plates are typically circular, convex, and mucoid in appearance, with a coral-like or cauliflower-like structure.\n\nPhylogenetically, Corallococcus caeni is closely related to other members of the genus Corallococcus, which are known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic compounds and have been isolated from various environmental samples, including soil, sediments, and wastewater treatment systems.\n\nThe species Corallococcus caeni is of interest due to its potential role in the biological treatment of wastewater, as it may contribute to the degradation and removal of organic pollutants in these systems.",
