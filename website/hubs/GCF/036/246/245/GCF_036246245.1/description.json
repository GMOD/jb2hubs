  "description": "Companilactobacillus muriivasis is a species of lactic acid bacteria that was isolated from the feces of a laboratory mouse. It is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium. Companilactobacillus muriivasis is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 37°C. It can ferment various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and lactose, and produces lactic acid as the primary end-product of this fermentation. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has placed Companilactobacillus muriivasis within the genus Companilactobacillus, which is a member of the Lactobacillaceae family. This species is considered a commensal bacterium and may play a role in the gut microbiome of laboratory mice and potentially other rodents.",
