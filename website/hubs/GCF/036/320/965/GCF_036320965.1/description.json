  "description": "Panulirus ornatus, commonly known as the ornate rock lobster or painted spiny lobster, is a species of spiny lobster found in the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large, colorful crustacean that can reach up to 60 cm in length.\n\nThe carapace (the hard, upper shell) of Panulirus ornatus is typically covered in bright, intricate patterns of red, white, and blue, giving it a distinctive and striking appearance. The long, spiny antennae and legs are also brightly colored. This vibrant coloration is believed to serve as a form of camouflage, helping the lobster blend in with its coral reef and rocky habitat.\n\nPanulirus ornatus is known for its powerful claws and ability to defend itself against predators. It is a nocturnal species, spending the day hiding in crevices and emerging at night to forage for a variety of marine organisms, including small crustaceans, mollusks, and algae.\n\nThis species is an important commercial and subsistence fishery resource in many parts of its range, particularly in Southeast Asia. However, overfishing and habitat degradation have led to declines in some populations, making conservation efforts important for the long-term sustainability of this unique and visually striking spiny lobster.",
