  "description": "Aurantiacibacter hainanensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in Hainan Island, China. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium. The cells of A. hainanensis are motile with the presence of flagella. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. hainanensis belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes. The genus Aurantiacibacter was proposed to accommodate this species, which is characterized by its ability to produce orange-pigmented colonies due to the presence of carotenoid compounds. Biochemical analysis has revealed that A. hainanensis can utilize a variety of carbohydrates and organic acids as carbon sources for growth.\n\nThe genome of A. hainanensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles in the soil environment. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of the diversity and functions of bacteria in soil ecosystems.",
