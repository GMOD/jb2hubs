  "description": "Pelmatolapia mariae, also known as the Mary's cichlid or the Ivory Coast cichlid, is a species of freshwater fish belonging to the cichlid family. It is native to the coastal rivers and lagoons of West Africa, particularly in CÃ´te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).\n\nPelmatolapia mariae is a relatively small cichlid, typically reaching a maximum length of around 10-12 centimeters (4-5 inches). It has a laterally compressed body shape, with a distinctive rounded head and a small, terminal mouth. The coloration of Pelmatolapia mariae is generally pale or yellowish-white, with dark vertical bars or blotches along the sides of the body, which can help in its identification.\n\nThis species is often found in slow-moving or stagnant water habitats, such as rivers, streams, and lagoons, where it typically feeds on a variety of small invertebrates and plant material. Pelmatolapia mariae is an important part of the local ecosystem and may be utilized as a food source by local communities in its native range.\n\nDue to its restricted distribution and potential threats, such as habitat degradation and overfishing, the conservation status of Pelmatolapia mariae is currently being assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
