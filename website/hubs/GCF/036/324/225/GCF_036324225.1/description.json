  "description": "Altererythrobacter litoralis is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the family Erythrobacteraceae. It was first isolated from seawater collected from the coast of the Yellow Sea in China.\n\nThe cells of A. litoralis are coccoid to short-rod shaped, and they are motile by means of a single polar flagellum. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow-orange in color due to the presence of carotenoid pigments.\n\nPhysiologically, A. litoralis is oxidase and catalase positive, and it is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10째C to 37째C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28째C to 30째C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. litoralis is closely related to other members of the genus Altererythrobacter, which are known to be widely distributed in marine and coastal environments. The genome of A. litoralis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and ecological adaptations to the marine habitat.",
