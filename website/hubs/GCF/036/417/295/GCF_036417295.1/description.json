  "description": "Cryptococcus decagattii is a species of yeast-like fungus that belongs to the genus Cryptococcus. It is a member of the Cryptococcus neoformans species complex, which includes several other pathogenic Cryptococcus species.\n\nCryptococcus decagattii is an encapsulated, basidiomycetous yeast that can cause cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. The species was first isolated and described in 2015 from environmental samples collected in Colombia, South America.\n\nCryptococcus decagattii is closely related to Cryptococcus neoformans, a well-known human pathogen, but it has distinct genetic and phenotypic characteristics that differentiate it as a separate species. It is capable of producing melanin, which is a virulence factor that helps the fungus evade the host's immune system.\n\nThe ecology and natural habitat of Cryptococcus decagattii are not fully understood, but it is believed to be associated with certain tree species and soil environments. Further research is needed to elucidate its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and potential impact on public health, particularly in regions where it has been identified.",
