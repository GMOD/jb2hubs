  "description": "Coffea arabica, commonly known as the Arabian coffee or Java coffee, is a species of flowering evergreen shrub or small tree in the family Rubiaceae. It is believed to be native to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in southeastern South Sudan.\n\nCoffea arabica is a diploid species, meaning it has 44 chromosomes. It is self-pollinating and can grow up to 12 meters (39 feet) tall, although it is usually pruned to 2-4 meters (6.6-13.1 feet) for commercial cultivation. The leaves are dark green, glossy, and elliptical in shape, measuring 10-15 cm (3.9-5.9 inches) in length.\n\nThe plant produces white, fragrant flowers that develop into oval-shaped fruits known as coffee cherries. Each cherry contains two seeds, which are the coffee beans. Coffea arabica is considered to produce a superior quality coffee with a complex, nuanced flavor profile compared to other coffee species.\n\nThe species is adapted to grow in tropical highland regions with temperatures ranging from 15-24°C (59-75°F) and an annual rainfall of 1,000-2,000 mm (39.4-78.7 inches). It is widely cultivated in various parts of the world, including Central and South America, Africa, and Asia, and is one of the most economically important coffee species globally.",
