  "description": "Scheffersomyces coipomensis is a species of yeast that was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Coipoma, Chile. It belongs to the genus Scheffersomyces, which is a member of the phylum Ascomycota, the largest phylum of fungi.\n\nScheffersomyces coipomensis is a haploid, single-celled organism that reproduces asexually through budding. The cells are generally oval or ellipsoidal in shape and measure approximately 3-6 micrometers in diameter.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the sequence of the D1/D2 domain of the large subunit (26S) ribosomal DNA has shown that S. coipomensis is closely related to other Scheffersomyces species, forming a distinct clade within the genus.\n\nThe species is considered to be an environmental isolate, and its ecological role and potential applications, if any, are not yet well-characterized. Further research may be needed to elucidate the specific traits and capabilities of this yeast species.",
