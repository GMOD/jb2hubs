  "description": "Oncorhynchus masou masou, commonly known as the Amago trout, is a subspecies of the masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) native to the Japanese archipelago. It is a member of the Pacific salmon genus Oncorhynchus.\n\nThe Amago trout is an anadromous fish, meaning it migrates between freshwater and marine environments to spawn. It typically spends the first one to three years of its life in freshwater streams and rivers before migrating to the ocean to feed and grow. After one to three years in the ocean, the adults return to their natal streams to spawn.\n\nThe Amago trout is characterized by its distinctive coloration, with a silvery-blue back, red or orange fins, and prominent black spots on its body. It is an important recreational and commercial species in Japan, known for its high-quality flesh and is also valued for its cultural significance.\n\nConservation efforts are ongoing to protect wild populations of the Amago trout, as it faces threats from habitat degradation, overfishing, and competition with introduced species. Researchers continue to study the biology, ecology, and population dynamics of this unique subspecies of the masu salmon.",
