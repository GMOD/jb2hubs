  "description": "Narcine bancroftii, commonly known as the Bancroft's electric ray or Bancroft's numbfish, is a species of electric ray belonging to the family Narcinidae. It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, primarily along the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.\n\nThe Bancroft's electric ray is a small to medium-sized ray, typically reaching a maximum disc width of around 40 centimeters (16 inches). It has a rounded, disc-shaped body with a short, blunt snout and large, wing-like pectoral fins. The dorsal surface of the ray is typically brown or greyish-brown in color, while the ventral surface is pale or white.\n\nLike other electric rays, Narcine bancroftii is equipped with specialized electric organs that can generate an electric discharge for the purposes of defense and prey capture. These electric organs are located on the underside of the ray's disc and can deliver a mild shock to potential predators or prey.\n\nThe Bancroft's electric ray is a benthic species, preferring to inhabit sandy or muddy seafloors in shallow to moderate depths, typically less than 100 meters (330 feet). It feeds primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and other invertebrates.\n\nDue to its relatively small size and limited distribution, the Bancroft's electric ray is not considered a commercially important species. However, it may face threats from habitat degradation, coastal development, and bycatch in fisheries targeting other marine species.",
