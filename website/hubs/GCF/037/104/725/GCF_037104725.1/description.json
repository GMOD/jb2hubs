  "description": "Bacillus bruguierae is a species of Gram-positive, spore-forming, aerobic bacteria that was isolated from the rhizosphere of the mangrove plant Bruguiera gymnorrhiza. The species was first described in 2007 based on its morphological, physiological, and genetic characteristics.\n\nBacillus bruguierae cells are rod-shaped, ranging from 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-4.0 μm in length. The bacteria are capable of forming oval-shaped endospores under unfavorable environmental conditions. They are motile, with peritrichous flagella, and can grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Bacillus bruguierae is closely related to other Bacillus species, particularly those found in marine and estuarine environments. The species is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources and can produce various hydrolytic enzymes, such as amylase and cellulase.\n\nBacillus bruguierae is believed to play a role in the nutrient cycling and plant growth promotion in mangrove ecosystems, where it was originally isolated. Further research is ongoing to elucidate the specific ecological functions and potential applications of this bacterial species.",
