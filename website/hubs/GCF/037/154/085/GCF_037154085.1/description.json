  "description": "Altererythrobacter fulvus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Erythrobacteraceae family. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of A. fulvus are typically rod-shaped and motile, with a yellow or orange pigmentation.\n\nA. fulvus was first isolated from seawater samples collected from the East China Sea. The species is known to thrive in marine environments and can tolerate a wide range of salt concentrations. Physiologically, A. fulvus is capable of oxidizing various organic compounds and can grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 40°C.\n\nGenetically, the genome of A. fulvus has been sequenced and analyzed, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the marine environment. The species is classified based on its unique 16S rRNA gene sequence and other phenotypic characteristics that distinguish it from other members of the Altererythrobacter genus.\n\nOverall, A. fulvus is a marine bacterium that contributes to the diversity and functional roles of microbial communities in aquatic ecosystems.",
