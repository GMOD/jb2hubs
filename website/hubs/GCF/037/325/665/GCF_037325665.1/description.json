  "description": "Littorina saxatilis, commonly known as the rough periwinkle or gray periwinkle, is a species of small marine gastropod mollusk in the family Littorinidae. It is a snail that lives on rocky shores and is found in the intertidal zone.\n\nThe shell of Littorina saxatilis is typically gray or brown in color, with a rough, uneven surface. The shell is ovate in shape and can reach a maximum size of around 20 millimeters in height. The shell has a low-spired, coiled structure, which helps the snail to avoid desiccation during low tide.\n\nLittorina saxatilis is a herbivorous species, feeding on a variety of algae and microbial biofilms that grow on the rocky surfaces. It plays an important role in the ecology of the intertidal zone, as it helps to control the growth of algae and contributes to the overall biodiversity of the rocky shore environment.\n\nThe species is widely distributed along the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean, from the Arctic regions to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, and from eastern Canada to the eastern United States in North America. It is known for its remarkable adaptability and ability to thrive in a range of environmental conditions, from the upper reaches of the intertidal zone to the lower, more submerged areas.",
