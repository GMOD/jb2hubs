  "description": "Amphibiibacter pelophylacis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a soil sample collected from a wetland area. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, a group of bacteria known for their ability to degrade a wide range of organic compounds, including complex polymers.\n\nThis species is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic bacterium that is rod-shaped and motile. It grows optimally at temperatures around 30Â°C and can tolerate a relatively broad range of pH conditions, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Amphibiibacter pelophylacis is most closely related to other bacteria within the genus Amphibiibacter, which are typically found in aquatic or wetland environments.\n\nThe specific ecological role and functional capabilities of Amphibiibacter pelophylacis within its natural habitat are not yet fully understood, but its isolation from a wetland soil sample suggests it may play a role in the cycling and decomposition of organic matter in these types of ecosystems.",
