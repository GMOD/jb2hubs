  "description": "Macrotis lagotis, commonly known as the greater bilby, is a species of nocturnal, burrowing marsupial found in arid and semi-arid regions of central and western Australia. It belongs to the family Thylacomyidae, which includes the bilbies, the only extant members of the order Phalangeriformes.\n\nThe greater bilby is a medium-sized marsupial, with a head-body length of 29-55 cm and a weight of 1-2.5 kg. It has large, rabbit-like ears, a long, pointed snout, and a long, slender tail. Its fur is soft and silky, with a distinctive coloration pattern â€“ the upper parts are grey or pale brown, while the underparts are white. The greater bilby is an omnivorous species, feeding on a variety of plant matter, small invertebrates, and small vertebrates.\n\nThe greater bilby is a fossorial (burrowing) species, constructing complex burrow systems that can extend up to 3 meters deep and 6 meters in length. These burrows provide shelter, protection from predators, and a suitable environment for breeding and raising young. The species is known for its unique reproductive biology, with females giving birth to a single joey after a short gestation period of around 12-14 days.\n\nOnce widespread across much of Australia, the greater bilby has experienced significant population declines due to habitat loss, predation by introduced species, and competition with other introduced herbivores. It is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and restore its populations.",
