  "description": "Azonexus hydrophilus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Azonexus hydrophilus is found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and brackish water habitats, where it plays a role in the cycling of nutrients and organic matter.\n\nThe cells of Azonexus hydrophilus are typically 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. They are capable of motility through the use of flagella. Azonexus hydrophilus is chemoorganotrophic, meaning it derives its energy from the oxidation of organic compounds.\n\nPhylogenetically, Azonexus hydrophilus is closely related to other members of the Azonexus genus, which are known to be involved in denitrification processes in aquatic ecosystems. The species is capable of reducing nitrate to nitrite, contributing to the nitrogen cycle in the environments where it is found.\n\nOverall, Azonexus hydrophilus is an important component of aquatic microbial communities, playing a role in the cycling of nutrients and the maintenance of ecosystem balance in the habitats it inhabits.",
