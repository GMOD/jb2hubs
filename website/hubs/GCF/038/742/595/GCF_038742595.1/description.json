  "description": "Aequorivita flava is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aequorivita flava is yellow-pigmented, with a rod-shaped morphology, and is motile by means of a single polar flagellum.\n\nThis species was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of South Korea. It is able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 4°C to 37°C, and can tolerate moderate levels of salinity. Aequorivita flava is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, including agar, alginate, and carboxymethylcellulose, which suggests its potential role in the marine carbon cycle.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Aequorivita flava is most closely related to other members of the genus Aequorivita, which are typically found in marine and coastal environments.",
