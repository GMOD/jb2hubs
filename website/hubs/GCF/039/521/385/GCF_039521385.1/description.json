  "description": "Clostridium oceanicum is a species of anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacteria that was isolated from marine sediments. It is a member of the genus Clostridium, which are known for their ability to produce endospores, allowing them to survive in harsh environmental conditions.\n\nC. oceanicum is described as a rod-shaped bacterium, typically measuring around 3-5 µm in length and 0.5-0.8 µm in width. It is motile, with the help of peritrichous flagella, which enables it to move through its aquatic environment.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. oceanicum belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia. It is classified as a mesophilic organism, with an optimal growth temperature range of 25-40°C.\n\nMetabolically, C. oceanicum is capable of fermenting a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as well as certain amino acids. This metabolic versatility allows the bacterium to thrive in the nutrient-rich marine sediments where it was originally isolated.\n\nThe ecological role of C. oceanicum in its natural habitat is not fully understood, but it is likely involved in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients within the marine ecosystem.",
