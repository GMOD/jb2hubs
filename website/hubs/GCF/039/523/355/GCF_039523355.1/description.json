  "description": "Aliiglaciecola litoralis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a tidal flat sediment sample collected in South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. The cells are rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for A. litoralis is around 25-30Â°C, and it can grow at a pH range of 6.0-9.0. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that A. litoralis belongs to the class Gammaproteobacteria and is closely related to the genus Aliiglaciecola, within the family Alteromonadaceae. The genome of A. litoralis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential roles in the marine ecosystem.",
