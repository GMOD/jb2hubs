  "description": "Alteraurantiacibacter aestuarii is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a tidal flat sediment sample collected in South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nThe cells of Alteraurantiacibacter aestuarii are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and motile, with gliding motility. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are orange-colored.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that Alteraurantiacibacter aestuarii is closely related to other members of the genus Alteraurantiacibacter, which are known to be capable of degrading complex carbohydrates.\n\nThis species is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10째C to 37째C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25째C to 30째C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH values, from 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH of 7.0 to 8.0.\n\nThe genome of Alteraurantiacibacter aestuarii has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles in the tidal flat environment from which it was isolated.",
