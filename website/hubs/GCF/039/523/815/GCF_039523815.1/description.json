  "description": "Brevundimonas kwangchunensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevundimonas. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of B. kwangchunensis are typically rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil samples collected in Kwangchun, South Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that B. kwangchunensis is closely related to other Brevundimonas species, such as Brevundimonas diminuta and Brevundimonas vesicularis.\n\nB. kwangchunensis is capable of growing on a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and various organic acids. It can tolerate a wide range of pH values and temperatures, making it adaptable to diverse environmental conditions.\n\nThe genome of B. kwangchunensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of bacterial diversity and their interactions within soil ecosystems.",
