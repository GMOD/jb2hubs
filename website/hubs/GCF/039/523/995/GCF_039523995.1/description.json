  "description": "Aquimarina litoralis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a sediment sample collected from the coast of South Korea. It belongs to the genus Aquimarina, which is a part of the family Flavobacteriaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nSome key characteristics of Aquimarina litoralis:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped, and motile with gliding motility.\n\n2. Colony appearance: Colonies on agar plates are yellow-pigmented, circular, and convex.\n\n3. Temperature and pH range: The optimal growth temperature is around 25-30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-9.0.\n\n4. Chemotaxonomic features: The major fatty acids are iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0 3-OH, and summed feature 3 (C16:1ω7c and/or C16:1ω6c).\n\n5. Genomic characteristics: The G+C content of the genomic DNA is around 36-37 mol%.\n\n6. Habitat and ecology: Aquimarina litoralis was isolated from a coastal sediment sample, suggesting it is adapted to marine environments.\n\nThis species has been characterized and described in the scientific literature to contribute to the understanding of the diversity and ecology of bacteria in coastal marine ecosystems.",
