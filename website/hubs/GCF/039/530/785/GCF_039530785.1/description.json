  "description": "Brachybacterium phenoliresistens is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brachybacterium, which is a member of the phylum Actinobacteria. This species was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea.\n\nBrachybacterium phenoliresistens is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It has a coccoid or rod-shaped morphology and is typically 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The cells can occur singly, in pairs, or in short chains.\n\nOne of the notable characteristics of Brachybacterium phenoliresistens is its ability to tolerate and degrade phenol, a toxic organic compound. This phenol-resistant trait is likely an adaptation that allows the bacterium to thrive in environments contaminated with phenol, such as industrial wastewater or soil polluted by chemical spills.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Brachybacterium phenoliresistens is closely related to other Brachybacterium species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.\n\nThe identification and study of Brachybacterium phenoliresistens have potential applications in bioremediation and the development of strategies for the treatment of phenol-contaminated environments.",
