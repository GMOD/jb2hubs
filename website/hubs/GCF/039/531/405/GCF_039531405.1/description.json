  "description": "Brevibacterium salitolerans is a species of gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coryneform bacteria. It was first isolated from a saline soil sample collected in Xinjiang, China.\n\nThe cells of B. salitolerans are short, rod-shaped, and non-motile. They typically measure 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are circular, smooth, and creamy white in color.\n\nBiochemically, B. salitolerans is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It can grow in the presence of up to 20% (w/v) sodium chloride, indicating its halotolerant nature. The optimal growth temperature is around 30-37°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that B. salitolerans belongs to the genus Brevibacterium, which is a member of the phylum Actinobacteria. The species is closely related to other halotolerant Brevibacterium species, such as B. halotolerans and B. mcbrellneri.\n\nThe ability of B. salitolerans to tolerate high salt concentrations suggests that it may play a role in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and adaptation of microbial communities in saline environments.",
