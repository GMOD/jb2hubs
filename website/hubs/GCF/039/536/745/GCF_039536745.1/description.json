  "description": "Actimicrobium antarcticum is a species of bacterium that was isolated from soil samples collected in Antarctica. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Actimicrobium antarcticum is psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow at low temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature range of 15-25°C.\n\nThe cells of Actimicrobium antarcticum are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive, and it is capable of hydrolyzing casein, gelatin, and starch.\n\nPhylogenetically, Actimicrobium antarcticum belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria and is closely related to other members of the genus Actimicrobium, which are known to be adapted to cold environments. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of Actimicrobium antarcticum is around 68-70 mol%.\n\nThis species of bacterium is considered psychrotolerant and may play a role in the cycling of nutrients and organic matter in the harsh Antarctic environment, where it has adapted to thrive in the low-temperature conditions.",
