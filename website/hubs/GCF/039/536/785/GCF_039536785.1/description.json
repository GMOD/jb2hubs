  "description": "Actinomadura miaoliensis is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Miaoli County, Taiwan. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium that forms extensively branched substrate and aerial mycelia.\n\nThe cells of A. miaoliensis are coccoid or rod-shaped, and they exhibit a characteristic orange-brown pigmentation. The bacterium is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that A. miaoliensis belongs to the genus Actinomadura, which is a member of the family Thermomonosporaceae within the order Streptosporangiales. The species is closely related to other Actinomadura species, but it can be distinguished from them based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.\n\nA. miaoliensis is known to produce various secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which may have potential applications in the pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries. Further research on this species could provide insights into its ecological role, metabolic capabilities, and potential for biotechnological exploitation.",
