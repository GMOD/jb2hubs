  "description": "Aeromicrobium panaciterrae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Actinobacteria class. It was first isolated from soil samples collected from a ginseng field in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Aeromicrobium panaciterrae are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nAeromicrobium panaciterrae is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is capable of hydrolyzing starch and casein, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aeromicrobium panaciterrae is closely related to other members of the Aeromicrobium genus, which are commonly found in soil and aquatic environments.\n\nThis species has been characterized as having a yellowish-white colony color and a catalase-positive and oxidase-positive reaction. Its optimal growth temperature is reported to be around 30°C.\n\nThe genome of Aeromicrobium panaciterrae has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic makeup and potential metabolic capabilities. Further research may reveal more about the ecological role and potential applications of this bacterial species.",
