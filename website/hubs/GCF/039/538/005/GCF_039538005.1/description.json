  "description": "Allohahella marinimesophila is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Hahellaceae. It is a mesophilic, halophilic, and heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it thrives in moderate temperatures, requires salt for growth, and relies on organic compounds as its source of energy and carbon.\n\nThis species was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected from the coastal region of the East China Sea. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. The cells are typically rod-shaped and can range in size from 0.5 to 1.5 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 3.0 micrometers in length.\n\nAllohahella marinimesophila is capable of growing in a wide range of salinities, with an optimal growth occurring at around 3-7% (w/v) NaCl concentration. The optimal temperature for its growth is around 30-37Â°C, making it a mesophilic organism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data has shown that Allohahella marinimesophila is closely related to other members of the Hahellaceae family, which are commonly found in marine environments. This species may play a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in the marine ecosystem where it is found.",
