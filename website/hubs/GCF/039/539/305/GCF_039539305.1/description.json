  "description": "Aquimarina addita is a species of bacterium that belongs to the genus Aquimarina. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aquimarina addita was first isolated from a sediment sample collected from the East Sea, off the coast of South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Aquimarina addita are rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to glide. They are typically 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C.\n\nAquimarina addita is able to hydrolyze a variety of substrates, including gelatin, casein, and starch, indicating its ability to degrade complex organic compounds. The bacterium is also capable of producing carotenoid pigments, which give the colonies a yellow or orange color.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimarina addita is closely related to other members of the genus Aquimarina, which are commonly found in marine environments, such as seawater, sediments, and algae.",
