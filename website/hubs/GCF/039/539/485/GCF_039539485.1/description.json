  "description": "Celeribacter arenosi is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Alphaproteobacteria. It was first isolated from sand samples collected from a coastal area in South Korea.\n\nCeleribacter arenosi is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium. It is capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. The cells are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\nBiochemically, Celeribacter arenosi is able to utilize a variety of carbon sources, such as glucose, sucrose, and various organic acids. It also exhibits catalase and oxidase activities, which are common features among members of the Alphaproteobacteria class.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Celeribacter arenosi is closely related to other members of the genus Celeribacter, which are known to be associated with marine and coastal environments.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of Celeribacter arenosi are still under investigation, but its isolation from sand samples suggests that it may play a role in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and organic matter in coastal ecosystems.",
