  "description": "Algibacter aquimarinus is a species of bacteria that was isolated from seawater collected from the East China Sea. It belongs to the genus Algibacter, which is classified within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nAlgibacter aquimarinus is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Cells are rod-shaped and motile, with gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C, and it can grow at a wide range of salinities, from 1% to 10% NaCl.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Algibacter aquimarinus is most closely related to other Algibacter species, such as Algibacter lectus and Algibacter antarcticus, which were also isolated from marine environments.\n\nThis bacterium is considered to be a heterotrophic, marine-adapted species that may play a role in the degradation of complex organic matter in the marine ecosystem. Further research is needed to elucidate its specific ecological functions and potential biotechnological applications.",
