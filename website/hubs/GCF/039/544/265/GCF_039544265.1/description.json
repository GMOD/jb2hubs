  "description": "Corallincola platygyrae is a species of parasitic isopod that infects the coral Platygira spp. It is a member of the family Cryptoniscidae, a group of isopods that are known to parasitize a variety of marine invertebrates, including corals.\n\nCorallincola platygyrae is a small, elongated crustacean that lives within the body cavity of the host coral. It feeds on the host's tissues, causing damage and potentially impacting the coral's health and growth. The species is believed to have a complex life cycle, with different developmental stages occurring both within the host coral and in the surrounding marine environment.\n\nLimited research has been conducted on the specific biology and ecology of Corallincola platygyrae, and its impact on the host coral species Platygira spp. is not yet fully understood. Further study is needed to elucidate the details of this parasitic relationship and its implications for coral reef ecosystems.",
