  "description": "Bartonella schoenbuchensis is a species of gram-negative, facultatively intracellular bacteria that belongs to the genus Bartonella. It was first isolated from the blood of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in the Sch√∂nbuch Nature Park, Germany.\n\nBartonella schoenbuchensis is a slow-growing, fastidious bacterium that requires specialized culture media for growth. It is a hemotropic pathogen, meaning it primarily infects and resides within the red blood cells of its mammalian hosts. The bacterium is transmitted by hematophagous (blood-feeding) arthropods, such as ticks and fleas.\n\nPhylogenetically, Bartonella schoenbuchensis is closely related to other Bartonella species that infect wild and domestic animals, including humans. It has been detected in various wildlife species, including roe deer, red deer, and wild boar, suggesting a role as a reservoir host for this bacterium in natural ecosystems.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the epidemiology, host-pathogen interactions, and potential public health implications of Bartonella schoenbuchensis infections.",
