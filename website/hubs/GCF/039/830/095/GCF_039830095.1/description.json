  "description": "Unfortunately, I do not have enough specific scientific information to provide a detailed description of the species Dolosigranulum savutiense. This appears to be a rather uncommon or lesser-known bacterial species, and I was unable to find reliable published sources with comprehensive scientific data about its characteristics, taxonomy, habitat, or other relevant details.\n\nIn general, Dolosigranulum is a genus of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid bacteria that are typically isolated from environmental samples. However, without access to primary literature or other authoritative sources, I cannot confidently state anything more definitive about the specific species D. savutiense. More research would be needed to gather accurate scientific information to include in a detailed description of this particular bacterial taxon.",
