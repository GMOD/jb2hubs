  "description": "Burkholderia stagnalis is a species of Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile bacteria belonging to the genus Burkholderia. It was first isolated from stagnant water samples collected in Thailand.\n\nSome key features of Burkholderia stagnalis:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Burkholderia stagnalis cells are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-1.0 µm in width and 1.2-2.5 µm in length.\n\n2. Growth characteristics: The bacterium is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 42°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 37°C. It can tolerate a wide pH range, from 5.0 to 8.0, with optimal growth at pH 6.5-7.5.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: Burkholderia stagnalis is positive for catalase and oxidase activities. It can utilize a variety of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and various organic acids.\n\n4. Habitat and ecology: As the name suggests, Burkholderia stagnalis was initially isolated from stagnant water samples. It is believed to be ubiquitous in aquatic environments, such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.\n\n5. Genomic characteristics: The genome of Burkholderia stagnalis has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome of approximately 7.4 Mb in size, with a GC content around 67%.\n\nBurkholderia stagnalis is considered a non-pathogenic bacterium and has not been associated with any known human or animal diseases. Its ecological role in aquatic environments is still under investigation, but it may be involved in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in these ecosystems.",
