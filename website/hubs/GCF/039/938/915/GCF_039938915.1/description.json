  "description": "Devosia alba is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Devosia. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Devosia alba was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Devosia alba are approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, with the help of multiple polar flagella. The colonies formed by Devosia alba on agar plates are circular, convex, and white in color.\n\nDevosia alba is considered a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it relies on organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The bacterium can tolerate a wide range of pH values, from 5.5 to 8.5, with a preferred pH around 7.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Devosia alba is closely related to other species within the genus Devosia, which are known to be involved in various environmental processes, such as nitrogen fixation and the degradation of complex organic compounds.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological and biochemical characteristics, as well as the ecological roles of Devosia alba, may provide insights into its potential applications in various fields, such as bioremediation or biotechnology.",
