  "description": "Cystobasidium minutum MCA 4210 is a species of yeast that belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a unicellular, eukaryotic microorganism that reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nThe cells of Cystobasidium minutum MCA 4210 are typically small, round, or ovoid in shape, with a diameter ranging from 2 to 5 micrometers. The species is known to be psychrophilic, meaning it is adapted to grow and thrive in cold environments, such as those found in polar or subpolar regions.\n\nCystobasidium minutum MCA 4210 is a basidiomycetous yeast, which means it belongs to the group of fungi that produce spores on club-shaped structures called basidia. The species is classified within the genus Cystobasidium, which is known for its ability to produce extracellular enzymes and its potential applications in biotechnology.\n\nThe strain MCA 4210 was likely isolated from a specific environmental sample or location, and its unique identification number (4210) may refer to the specific collection or laboratory where it was first characterized.\n\nOverall, Cystobasidium minutum MCA 4210 is a cold-adapted, basidiomycetous yeast with potential applications in various biotechnological processes due to its ability to produce extracellular enzymes and thrive in low-temperature environments.",
