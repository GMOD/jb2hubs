  "description": "Blautia caccae is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Blautia. It was first isolated from human fecal samples.\n\nThe key features of Blautia caccae are:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are straight to slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Physiology: Blautia caccae is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates and producing acetate, propionate, and butyrate as the main end-products of its metabolism.\n\n3. Habitat and Ecology: Blautia caccae is a member of the human gut microbiome and has been found to be abundant in the feces of healthy individuals. It is believed to play a role in the maintenance of a balanced gut ecosystem and may have potential beneficial effects on human health.\n\n4. Taxonomy and Phylogeny: Blautia caccae is classified within the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Lachnospiraceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that it is closely related to other species within the genus Blautia.\n\nOverall, Blautia caccae is a commensal bacterium that resides in the human gut and may contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, though its precise functional roles are still being investigated.",
