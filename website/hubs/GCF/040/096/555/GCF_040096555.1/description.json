  "description": "Coprococcus intestinihominis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium that resides within the human gut microbiome. It belongs to the genus Coprococcus, which is a member of the Lachnospiraceae family, a group of bacteria commonly found in the human intestinal tract.\n\nThe specific epithet \"intestinihominis\" refers to the bacterium's habitat, which is the human intestine. Coprococcus intestinihominis is a non-spore-forming, non-motile organism that thrives in the anaerobic environment of the human gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThis species is believed to play a role in the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiome, potentially contributing to the overall well-being and immune function of the host. Further research is ongoing to elucidate the precise metabolic capabilities and potential beneficial interactions of Coprococcus intestinihominis within the complex ecosystem of the human gut.",
