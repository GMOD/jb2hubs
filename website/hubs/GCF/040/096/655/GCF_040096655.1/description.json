  "description": "Blautia intestinihominis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the genus Blautia. It was first isolated from the human intestinal tract.\n\nThe cells of Blautia intestinihominis are typically short, rod-shaped, and non-motile. They are known to be involved in the fermentation of complex carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids, which are important for gut health and function.\n\nThis species is considered a commensal bacterium, meaning it is commonly found in the human gut microbiome and typically does not cause disease. It is believed to play a role in maintaining a balanced and diverse gut microbial community, which is important for overall human health and well-being.\n\nOngoing research aims to further elucidate the specific metabolic capabilities, ecological interactions, and potential health-promoting properties of Blautia intestinihominis within the human gut ecosystem.",
