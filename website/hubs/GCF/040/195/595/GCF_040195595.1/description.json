  "description": "Brevundimonas aurifodinae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevundimonas. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of B. aurifodinae are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-1.2 μm in length. They are motile, with a single polar flagellum.\n\nB. aurifodinae was first isolated from a gold mine in China. It is classified as a species within the genus Brevundimonas, which is a member of the family Caulobacteraceae in the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that B. aurifodinae is closely related to other Brevundimonas species, such as Brevundimonas diminuta and Brevundimonas vesicularis.\n\nThe species is known to be able to grow in the presence of various heavy metals, including gold, and may have potential applications in bioremediation and metal recovery processes.",
