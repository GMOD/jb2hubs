  "description": "Deinococcus sonorensis KR-87 is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Deinococcus. The genus Deinococcus is known for its remarkable ability to withstand a wide range of environmental stresses, including high levels of radiation, desiccation, and oxidative stress.\n\nDeinococcus sonorensis KR-87 was first isolated from a soil sample collected in the Sonoran Desert, located in the southwestern United States. This bacterium is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile microorganism. It has a distinctive red or pink pigmentation, which is characteristic of many Deinococcus species and is believed to play a role in their resistance to radiation and other environmental stressors.\n\nDeinococcus sonorensis KR-87 is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds in its environment. It is capable of growing under a range of temperature and pH conditions, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.\n\nThe genome of Deinococcus sonorensis KR-87 has been sequenced, providing insights into the genetic mechanisms that contribute to its remarkable stress tolerance. Researchers continue to study this species to better understand the fundamental principles of radiation resistance and the potential applications of such extremophilic bacteria in fields such as bioremediation, biotechnology, and space exploration.",
