  "description": "Aquamicrobium terrae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Hyphomicrobiaceae. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aquamicrobium terrae was first isolated from soil samples collected in China.\n\nThe cells of Aquamicrobium terrae are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. It can tolerate a pH range of 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH around 7.0-7.5.\n\nAquamicrobium terrae is known to be capable of degrading various organic compounds, including carbohydrates, alcohols, and organic acids. It is considered a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires organic carbon sources for energy and growth. The bacterium is also capable of nitrogen fixation, which allows it to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be utilized by plants and other organisms.\n\nThe ecological role of Aquamicrobium terrae in the environment is not yet fully understood, but it is believed to be involved in nutrient cycling and the decomposition of organic matter in soil ecosystems.",
