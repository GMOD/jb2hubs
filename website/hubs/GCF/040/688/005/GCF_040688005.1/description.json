  "description": "Companilactobacillus musae is a species of lactic acid bacteria that was isolated from the fermented pulp of banana (Musa sp.). It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Companilactobacillus genus within the Lactobacillaceae family.\n\nThe cells of C. musae are typically 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-3.0 μm long, and they can occur singly, in pairs, or in short chains. This species is facultatively anaerobic, meaning it can grow both in the presence and absence of oxygen. It is also homofermentative, producing primarily lactic acid as the end-product of carbohydrate fermentation.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. musae is closely related to other Companilactobacillus species, such as C. hordei and C. zymae. This bacterium is believed to play a role in the fermentation and preservation of banana pulp, contributing to the unique flavor and texture of fermented banana products.",
