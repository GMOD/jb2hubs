  "description": "Aliikangiella maris is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of Japan. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, which is a diverse group of bacteria commonly found in various aquatic and terrestrial environments.\n\nAliikangiella maris is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is typically rod-shaped, with a size range of approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. The cells of A. maris exhibit gliding motility, which is a unique form of movement without the use of flagella.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that A. maris is closely related to other members of the genus Aliikangiella, which are known to be associated with marine environments. The genus Aliikangiella was first proposed in 2016 to accommodate bacteria that were previously classified within the genus Polaribacter.\n\nAliikangiella maris is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, such as agar, alginate, and carrageenan, suggesting its potential involvement in the degradation of complex organic matter in marine ecosystems. Additionally, the species has been reported to produce carotenoid pigments, which may contribute to its ability to withstand environmental stressors.\n\nFurther research on the ecological roles, metabolic capabilities, and potential applications of Aliikangiella maris may provide valuable insights into the diversity and functional significance of this marine bacterial species.",
