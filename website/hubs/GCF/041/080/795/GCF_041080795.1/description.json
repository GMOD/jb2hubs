  "description": "Bifidobacterium aquikefiricola is a species of anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacteria. It was isolated from water kefir, a fermented beverage made from sugar water and kefir grains.\n\nThe cells of Bifidobacterium aquikefiricola are typically short, thick rods with rounded ends. They are catalase-negative and exhibit a characteristic bifid or Y-shaped branching morphology, which is common among bifidobacteria.\n\nPhylogenetically, Bifidobacterium aquikefiricola belongs to the genus Bifidobacterium, which is a part of the Actinobacteria class. The species was first described in 2017 based on its distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, differentiating it from other known Bifidobacterium species.\n\nBifidobacterium aquikefiricola is considered a probiotic bacterium due to its potential beneficial effects on human health, particularly its association with the fermentation of water kefir. Further research is needed to fully understand its specific functional roles and potential applications in the food and health industries.",
