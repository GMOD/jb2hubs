  "description": "Neodothiora populina is a species of fungus that belongs to the phylum Ascomycota. It is a plant pathogen that primarily infects poplar trees (Populus spp.). The fungus causes a disease known as Septoria leaf spot or Septoria canker in its host plants.\n\nThe fungus produces small, dark, circular to irregular-shaped fruiting bodies called pycnidia on the leaves and stems of infected poplar trees. These pycnidia release numerous spores that can spread the infection to other parts of the tree or nearby plants. The disease can lead to premature leaf drop, reduced growth, and in severe cases, the death of the affected trees.\n\nNeodothiora populina is known to be widespread in areas where poplar trees are grown, including Europe, North America, and Asia. Understanding the biology and lifecycle of this fungal pathogen is important for developing effective management strategies to control the disease and protect poplar plantations and forests.",
