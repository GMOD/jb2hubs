  "description": "Eulemur rufifrons, commonly known as the red-fronted lemur, is a species of lemur native to the eastern and central regions of Madagascar. It is a medium-sized primate belonging to the family Lemuridae.\n\nThe red-fronted lemur is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown fur on the forehead, crown, and cheeks, with a grayish-brown body. They have large, expressive eyes and a pointed snout. These lemurs are arboreal and primarily move through the trees using a mix of quadrupedal and leaping locomotion.\n\nThey are diurnal and live in small social groups, typically consisting of a dominant breeding pair and their offspring. Their diet consists mainly of fruits, leaves, flowers, and some insects. Red-fronted lemurs play an important role in the ecosystem as seed dispersers, contributing to the regeneration of the forest.\n\nThe species is classified as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by deforestation and agriculture expansion in their native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique primate species and its critical forest habitats in Madagascar.",
