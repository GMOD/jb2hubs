  "description": "Cronobacter turicensis is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, facultatively anaerobic bacterium that belongs to the genus Cronobacter. It is a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family and is considered an opportunistic pathogen.\n\nCronobacter turicensis was first isolated in 2007 from a powdered infant formula and was named after the city of Zurich (Turicum in Latin), where it was discovered. It is closely related to other Cronobacter species, such as Cronobacter sakazakii, which have been associated with severe infections in infants, particularly meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and sepsis.\n\nThe bacterium is capable of growing in a wide range of temperatures, from 6°C to 47°C, and can survive in low-moisture environments, making it a concern in the production and storage of powdered infant formula and other low-moisture foods. Cronobacter turicensis has been found in various environmental sources, including water, soil, and household surfaces.\n\nInfections caused by Cronobacter turicensis are rare, but can be life-threatening, particularly in premature or immunocompromised infants. Proper hygiene, adequate preparation and storage of infant formula, and thorough cooking of food are important measures to prevent Cronobacter infections.",
