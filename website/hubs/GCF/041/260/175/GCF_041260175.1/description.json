  "description": "Vanrija albida is a species of fungus that belongs to the order Cantharellales. It is a white-colored, saprophytic fungus that commonly grows on decaying wood or soil in temperate forests.\n\nThe fruiting body of Vanrija albida is small, typically less than 5 cm in diameter, and has a convex to flat cap shape. The cap surface is smooth and white in color. The underside of the cap bears shallow, often branching, gill-like structures called \"veins\" rather than true gills. These veins are also white in color.\n\nThe spores of Vanrija albida are white, smooth, and cylindrical in shape. The fungus reproduces both sexually through the production of spores and asexually through the formation of specialized structures called rhizomorphs.\n\nVanrija albida is considered a decomposer fungus, playing a role in the breakdown of organic matter in forest ecosystems. It is not known to be edible or have any significant medicinal or commercial value.",
