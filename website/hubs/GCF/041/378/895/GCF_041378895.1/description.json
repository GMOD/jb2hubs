  "description": "Dechloromonas aquae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Betaproteobacteria class. It is a gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium that can be found in aquatic environments.\n\nThe key features of Dechloromonas aquae are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are typically rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.2-2.5 μm long.\n\n2. Oxygen requirements: Dechloromonas aquae is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism.\n\n3. Metabolism: It is capable of dechlorination, which is the process of removing chlorine atoms from organic compounds. This ability allows it to degrade certain chlorinated pollutants in the environment.\n\n4. Habitat and isolation: Dechloromonas aquae has been isolated from various aquatic environments, including groundwater, wastewater treatment plants, and river sediments.\n\n5. Phylogenetic relationships: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dechloromonas aquae is closely related to other dechlorinating bacteria within the Betaproteobacteria class.\n\nThis bacterium's ability to degrade chlorinated compounds makes it of interest in bioremediation and environmental biotechnology applications, particularly in the treatment of water and soil contaminated with chlorinated pollutants.",
