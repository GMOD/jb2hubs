  "description": "Argopecten irradians, commonly known as the bay scallop, is a species of scallop, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Pectinidae. This species is native to the western Atlantic Ocean, occurring along the east coast of North America from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe bay scallop has a characteristic fan-shaped shell, typically around 5-10 cm in diameter, with a distinctive radial ribbed pattern. The upper shell valve is usually brown or reddish-brown in color, while the lower valve is typically white. The animal's mantle, which is visible when the shell is open, is often brightly colored, ranging from blue to orange.\n\nBay scallops are found in shallow coastal waters, typically in seagrass beds, estuaries, and bays. They are filter feeders, extracting plankton and other small particles from the water column. Reproduction in this species involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water, with the resulting larvae developing in the plankton before settling and metamorphosing into juvenile scallops.\n\nDue to their desirable taste and texture, bay scallops are an important commercial and recreational fishery species along the Atlantic coast of North America. However, their populations have faced declines in recent decades due to factors such as habitat loss, overfishing, and environmental stressors.",
