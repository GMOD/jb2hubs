  "description": "Aquitalea pelogenes is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium. Aquitalea pelogenes was first isolated from a freshwater lake in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Aquitalea pelogenes are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the presence of flagella. They are capable of growing at a range of temperatures, typically between 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquitalea pelogenes is closely related to other members of the Aquitalea genus, which are commonly found in aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands. The genus Aquitalea was first proposed in 2006 and is characterized by its unique physiological and biochemical properties, as well as its distinct phylogenetic position within the Proteobacteria.\n\nOverall, Aquitalea pelogenes is a freshwater bacterial species that plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to the microbial community and food web dynamics in these environments.",
