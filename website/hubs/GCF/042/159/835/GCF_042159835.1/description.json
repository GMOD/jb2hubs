  "description": "Albibacterium profundi is a species of bacteria that was isolated from deep-sea sediment samples. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe cells of Albibacterium profundi are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Albibacterium profundi is closely related to other deep-sea sediment bacteria within the Bacteroidetes phylum. It is capable of growth at low temperatures, typical of the deep-sea environment from which it was isolated.\n\nBiochemical and physiological characterization has revealed that Albibacterium profundi is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates and organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. It is also able to reduce nitrate to nitrite, indicating its potential role in the nitrogen cycle in deep-sea ecosystems.\n\nThe isolation and description of Albibacterium profundi contributes to our understanding of the diversity and adaptations of bacterial communities inhabiting the deep-sea environment, which remains a largely unexplored frontier of microbial ecology.",
