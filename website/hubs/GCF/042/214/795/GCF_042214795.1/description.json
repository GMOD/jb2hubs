  "description": "Arcobacter iocasae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Arcobacter, which is a member of the family Campylobacteraceae. It was first isolated from the gut of the marine bivalve mollusk Iphigenia iocasae, which is found in the coastal waters of Brazil.\n\nArcobacter iocasae is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped, and motile bacterium. It is microaerophilic, meaning it requires a reduced oxygen environment for optimal growth. The bacterium is capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, from 15°C to 42°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C.\n\nBiochemically, Arcobacter iocasae is capable of reducing nitrate, hydrolyzing hippurate, and producing hydrogen sulfide. It is also capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for energy production.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Arcobacter iocasae is closely related to other Arcobacter species, particularly Arcobacter skirrowii and Arcobacter cryaerophilus, which are also associated with various animals and environments.\n\nThe ecological role and potential pathogenicity of Arcobacter iocasae are still under investigation, as the species was only recently described and its specific interactions with its host, Iphigenia iocasae, and other organisms in the marine environment are not yet fully understood.",
