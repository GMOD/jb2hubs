  "description": "Bactrocera oleae, commonly known as the olive fruit fly, is a species of tephritid fruit fly that is native to the Mediterranean region. It is considered a major pest of olive trees (Olea europaea), as the larvae of the fly feed on the pulp of developing olives, causing significant damage to olive crops.\n\nThe adult olive fruit fly is a small, brownish-yellow fly, approximately 5-6 millimeters in length, with distinctive dark bands on its wings. The females lay their eggs inside the olive fruit, and the larvae hatch and feed on the olive pulp, often causing the fruit to rot and fall prematurely from the tree.\n\nThe olive fruit fly has a complex life cycle, with multiple generations per year, and it can survive in both olive trees and alternative host plants. The species is well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate and can spread rapidly, making it a challenging pest to control.\n\nEffective management of the olive fruit fly often involves a combination of cultural, biological, and chemical control methods, depending on the local environmental conditions and the specific needs of olive growers.",
