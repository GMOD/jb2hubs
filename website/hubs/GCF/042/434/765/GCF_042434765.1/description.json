  "description": "Cellulomonas biazotea is a species of Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Cellulomonas. The genus Cellulomonas is known for its ability to degrade cellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls.\n\nCellulomonas biazotea is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a process known as nitrogen fixation. This means that the bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into a more biologically available form, such as ammonia (NH3), which can then be used by plants and other organisms as a source of nitrogen.\n\nThe cells of Cellulomonas biazotea are typically short rods, measuring approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They are non-spore-forming and non-motile. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can grow in a wide range of pH conditions, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nCellulomonas biazotea has been isolated from various environmental sources, such as soil, compost, and agricultural waste. Its ability to degrade cellulose and fix nitrogen makes it a potentially useful microorganism in various biotechnological applications, such as bioremediation, biofuel production, and sustainable agriculture.",
