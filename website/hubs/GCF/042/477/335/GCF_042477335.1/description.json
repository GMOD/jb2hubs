  "description": "Ovis canadensis, commonly known as the bighorn sheep, is a species of wild sheep indigenous to North America. These impressive animals are characterized by their large, curved horns that can weigh up to 30 pounds.\n\nBighorn sheep are well-adapted to the rugged, mountainous terrain they inhabit, with strong, agile limbs and exceptional balance that allows them to navigate steep, rocky slopes with ease. Their thick, wooly coats provide insulation in the harsh alpine environments where they live.\n\nThese herbivores feed primarily on grasses, forbs, and shrubs, and play an important role in the ecosystems they occupy by controlling vegetation growth and serving as prey for predators such as wolves, mountain lions, and bears.\n\nBighorn sheep are known for their spectacular mating rituals, where males engage in dramatic head-butting competitions to establish dominance and access to mates. Their populations have faced declines due to disease, habitat loss, and hunting, leading to conservation efforts to protect this iconic species of the American West.",
