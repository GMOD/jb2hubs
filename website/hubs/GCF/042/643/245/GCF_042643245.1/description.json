  "description": "Acidimangrovimonas pyrenivorans is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a mangrove sediment sample collected in Hainan, China. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nThe cells of A. pyrenivorans are rod-shaped, motile, and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30-35°C, and it can grow at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 8.5, with an optimal pH of 6.5-7.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that A. pyrenivorans belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes. The species is characterized by its ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly pyrene, which is a four-ring PAH compound. This metabolic capability suggests that A. pyrenivorans may play a role in the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated environments, such as mangrove ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Acidimangrovimonas pyrenivorans represents a novel species of bacteria with potential applications in environmental remediation due to its ability to degrade complex organic pollutants.",
