  "description": "Chryseomicrobium palamuruense is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected in Palamuru, India. It belongs to the genus Chryseomicrobium, which is a part of the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Chryseomicrobium palamuruense are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped. They are motile with the help of a single polar flagellum. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow in color.\n\nChryseomicrobium palamuruense is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for its growth and metabolism. It is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C. The bacterium can tolerate a wide range of pH values, from 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH of 7.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Chryseomicrobium palamuruense is most closely related to other species within the genus Chryseomicrobium, such as Chryseomicrobium amylolyticum and Chryseomicrobium imtechense.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of Chryseomicrobium palamuruense contributes to our understanding of the diversity of bacterial species present in the soil environment of Palamuru, India.",
