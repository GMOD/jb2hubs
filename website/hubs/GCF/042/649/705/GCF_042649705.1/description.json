  "description": "Algoriphagus namhaensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from seawater collected near Namhae Island, South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Algoriphagus namhaensis are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic. They have a rod-shaped morphology and are motile by means of gliding. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in the presence of up to 5% (w/v) sodium chloride.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Algoriphagus namhaensis is closely related to other members of the genus Algoriphagus, which are commonly found in marine and estuarine environments. The genus Algoriphagus is known for its ability to degrade complex polysaccharides, which may contribute to its ecological role in the cycling of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Algoriphagus namhaensis is a marine bacterium with characteristics typical of the Bacteroidetes phylum, and its discovery has contributed to our understanding of the diversity and potential functional roles of microorganisms in coastal environments.",
