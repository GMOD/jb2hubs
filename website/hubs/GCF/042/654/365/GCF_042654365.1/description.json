  "description": "Coralloluteibacterium thermophilum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a thermophilic, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of C. thermophilum are rod-shaped and exhibit a yellow pigmentation, which is likely due to the production of carotenoid compounds.\n\nThis species was isolated from a hot spring located in Yunnan Province, China, where the environmental temperature can reach up to 65Â°C. As a thermophilic bacterium, C. thermophilum is capable of growing and thriving in high-temperature environments.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. thermophilum is most closely related to other members of the genus Coralloluteibacterium, which are also known to be thermophilic bacteria. The genus Coralloluteibacterium is currently classified within the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nC. thermophilum is considered a valuable subject for research, as it may provide insights into the adaptive mechanisms and metabolic capabilities of thermophilic bacteria, which can have potential applications in various fields, such as biotechnology and environmental remediation.",
