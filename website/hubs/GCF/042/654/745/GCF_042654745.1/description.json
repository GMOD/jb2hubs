  "description": "Comamonas denitrificans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Comamonas, which is part of the Betaproteobacteria class. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium.\n\nThe key features of Comamonas denitrificans are:\n\n1. Denitrification Capabilities: This bacterium is capable of denitrification, which is the process of converting nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N2) under anaerobic conditions. This metabolic pathway allows the bacterium to use nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen.\n\n2. Aerobic and Anaerobic Growth: Comamonas denitrificans can grow both aerobically, using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor, as well as anaerobically, using nitrate as the electron acceptor.\n\n3. Habitat and Ecology: Comamonas denitrificans is commonly found in soil and aquatic environments, where it plays a role in the nitrogen cycle by facilitating the removal of nitrate through denitrification.\n\n4. Taxonomy and Phylogeny: Comamonas denitrificans was first isolated and described in the late 20th century. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that it is closely related to other Comamonas species within the Betaproteobacteria class.\n\nThis bacterium has potential applications in bioremediation and wastewater treatment due to its denitrification capabilities, which can help in the removal of excess nitrates from the environment.",
