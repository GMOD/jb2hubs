  "description": "Cohnella suwonensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Suwon, South Korea. It belongs to the genus Cohnella, which is a member of the phylum Firmicutes.\n\nCohnella suwonensis is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and motile. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Cohnella suwonensis is closely related to other Cohnella species, such as Cohnella thermotolerans and Cohnella laeviribosi. The species was named after the location of its original isolation, Suwon, South Korea.\n\nCohnella suwonensis has been reported to have potential applications in areas such as bioremediation and plant growth promotion due to its ability to produce enzymes and metabolites that may be beneficial in these contexts. However, further research is needed to fully understand the ecology and functional roles of this bacterial species.",
