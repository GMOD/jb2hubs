  "description": "Cohnella faecalis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Cohnella. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from human fecal samples.\n\nThe cells of Cohnella faecalis are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to form endospores. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 37°C (98.6°F), and it can grow in a wide range of pH conditions, from slightly acidic to slightly alkaline.\n\nCohnella faecalis is classified within the phylum Firmicutes and the family Paenibacillaceae. It is closely related to other members of the genus Cohnella, which are known to be found in various environmental and clinical samples, including soil, water, and the human gut microbiome.\n\nThe specific roles and functions of Cohnella faecalis within the human gut ecosystem are not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential interactions with other gut microbiota and its potential implications for human health.",
