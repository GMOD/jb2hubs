  "description": "Adhaeribacter terreus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. \n\nSome key characteristics of Adhaeribacter terreus:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile.\n\n2. Colony appearance: Colonies on agar plates are circular, convex, and brown-pigmented.\n\n3. Physiology: The bacterium is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth. It is chemoorganotrophic, using organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources.\n\n4. Habitat and ecology: Adhaeribacter terreus is found in terrestrial environments, particularly in soil. It is believed to play a role in the decomposition of organic matter in the soil ecosystem.\n\n5. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Adhaeribacter terreus is closely related to other members of the genus Adhaeribacter, which are classified within the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nOverall, Adhaeribacter terreus is a soil-dwelling bacterium that contributes to the cycling of organic matter in natural environments. Its identification and characterization can provide insights into the diversity and functions of soil microbial communities.",
