  "description": "Bizionia hallyeonensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from sediment samples collected from Hallyeon Beach in South Korea. It belongs to the genus Bizionia, which is a member of the family Flavobacteriaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nBizionia hallyeonensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and yellow in color.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Bizionia hallyeonensis is most closely related to other Bizionia species, sharing high sequence similarities with Bizionia argentinensis and Bizionia paragorgiae.\n\nThis species is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C. It can tolerate a wide range of salt concentrations, growing well in the presence of 0-8% (w/v) NaCl.\n\nThe genome of Bizionia hallyeonensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles in marine environments.",
