  "description": "Algoriphagus aquatilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a gram-negative, aerobic, and chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds.\n\nAlgoriphagus aquatilis was first isolated from freshwater samples collected from a river in South Korea. It is capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C.\n\nMorphologically, Algoriphagus aquatilis cells are rod-shaped and approximately 0.4-0.6 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. The cells are non-spore-forming and non-motile.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Algoriphagus aquatilis is closely related to other members of the genus Algoriphagus, which are commonly found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and marine habitats.\n\nThis bacterium is known to be capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides, including starch, xylan, and carboxymethylcellulose, suggesting its potential role in the decomposition of organic matter in aquatic ecosystems.",
