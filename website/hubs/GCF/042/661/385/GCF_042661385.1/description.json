  "description": "Deinococcus lacus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Deinococcus. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Deinococcus lacus is characterized by its ability to withstand extremely high levels of ionizing radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and other forms of environmental stress, which is a unique feature shared by the members of the Deinococcus genus.\n\nThis species was isolated from a freshwater lake in South Korea. It is known to form pink-pigmented colonies due to the presence of carotenoid pigments, which contribute to its remarkable resistance to radiation and oxidative stress. Deinococcus lacus is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds in its environment.\n\nThe genome of Deinococcus lacus has been sequenced, revealing insights into the genetic mechanisms that confer its extraordinary tolerance to various environmental stressors. This species has potential applications in bioremediation and radiation-resistant biotechnology due to its remarkable survival capabilities under extreme conditions.",
