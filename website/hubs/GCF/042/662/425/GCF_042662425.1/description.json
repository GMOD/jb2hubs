  "description": "Actinomadura yumaensis is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Yuma, Arizona, United States. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming bacterium that forms branched, filamentous hyphae characteristic of the genus Actinomadura.\n\nThe cells of A. yumaensis are coccoid to short rod-shaped, and they exhibit a range of colors including white, yellow, and orange when grown on various media. The bacterium is able to hydrolyze starch and casein, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as sole carbon sources for growth.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that A. yumaensis is closely related to other Actinomadura species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and biochemical characteristics. The species plays a role in the cycling of organic matter in the soil environments where it is found.",
