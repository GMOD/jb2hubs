  "description": "Catellatospora aurea is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Catellatospora aurea is known to form branched, mycelium-like structures during its growth and development.\n\nThe cells of Catellatospora aurea are typically coccoid or rod-shaped, and they can range in size from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometers in diameter. The colonies of this species appear golden-yellow in color, which is the reason for its specific epithet \"aurea,\" meaning \"golden\" in Latin.\n\nCatellatospora aurea is known to be capable of degrading various natural polymers, such as cellulose and chitin, due to the production of extracellular enzymes. This ability allows the bacterium to play a role in the recycling of organic matter in the environment.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Catellatospora aurea include a temperature range of 25-30Â°C and a slightly acidic pH between 5.5 and 7.0. This species has been isolated from various soil and sediment samples, suggesting its widespread distribution in natural environments.",
