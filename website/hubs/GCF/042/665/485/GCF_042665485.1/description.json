  "description": "Chryseobacterium zhengzhouense is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in Zhengzhou, China. The cells are yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. \n\nChryseobacterium zhengzhouense is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH, from pH 5.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH for growth around 7.0-8.0. \n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicates that Chryseobacterium zhengzhouense belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium within the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, but can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.\n\nChryseobacterium zhengzhouense has the ability to degrade various polysaccharides and has potential applications in areas such as bioremediation and industrial processes. Its isolation and characterization contribute to the understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of Chryseobacterium species in the environment.",
