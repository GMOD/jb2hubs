  "description": "Aquimarina celericrescens is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae. It was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of Jeju Island, South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Aquimarina celericrescens are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and exhibit gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in the presence of up to 5% (w/v) sodium chloride.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquimarina celericrescens is closely related to other Aquimarina species, which are commonly found in marine environments. The species name \"celericrescens\" refers to its ability to grow rapidly in culture.\n\nAquimarina celericrescens is considered a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it relies on organic compounds from its environment as a source of carbon and energy. Its genome has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles in marine ecosystems.",
