  "description": "Aquimarina rubra is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Aquimarina rubra is characterized by its red pigmentation, which is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments. The cells are typically rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C, and it requires sodium ions (Na+) for growth. Aquimarina rubra was first isolated from seawater collected near the coast of South Korea and has since been found in various marine environments, including sediments and algal surfaces. This species is known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic compounds, such as polysaccharides, and may play a role in the cycling of nutrients in marine ecosystems.",
