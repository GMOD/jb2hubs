  "description": "Camelimonas lactis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Camelimonas. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that is capable of fermenting lactose, a sugar found in milk.\n\nThe genus Camelimonas was first proposed in 2016 and is classified within the phylum Firmicutes, class Bacilli, and order Lactobacillales. Camelimonas lactis was isolated from camel milk and is known to be capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 37°C.\n\nThis bacterium is considered a potential probiotic due to its ability to survive in the gastrointestinal tract and its potential to produce beneficial metabolites, such as lactic acid, during the fermentation of lactose. The potential health benefits of Camelimonas lactis are currently under investigation, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in human and animal health.",
