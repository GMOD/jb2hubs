  "description": "Actinomadura geliboluensis is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil collected in Gelibolu, Turkey. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium that forms branched, filamentous colonies.\n\nThe cells of Actinomadura geliboluensis are typically rod-shaped, and they can grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 45°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C. The bacterium is capable of hydrolyzing various compounds, such as starch, casein, and gelatin, and it can utilize a range of carbon sources for growth.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Actinomadura geliboluensis is closely related to other members of the genus Actinomadura, which are known to produce diverse secondary metabolites and have potential applications in biotechnology and medicine.\n\nOverall, Actinomadura geliboluensis is a soil-dwelling actinobacterium with interesting physiological and metabolic characteristics that warrant further investigation for its potential ecological and biotechnological significance.",
