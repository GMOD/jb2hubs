  "description": "Cedecea davisae is a species of Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae. It was first isolated from the urine of a patient in 1981 and named after the microbiologist James J. Davis.\n\nSome key characteristics of Cedecea davisae include:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are short, non-spore-forming rods, typically measuring 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Growth requirements: It is capable of growing on a variety of standard microbiological media, such as nutrient agar and blood agar, at temperatures ranging from 25°C to 37°C.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: Cedecea davisae is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, lactose, and sucrose. It also exhibits catalase and oxidase activities.\n\n4. Habitat and clinical significance: Cedecea davisae has been isolated from various clinical sources, including urine, blood, and wound samples. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with underlying medical conditions or receiving medical interventions.\n\n5. Identification and classification: Cedecea davisae can be identified through biochemical tests, as well as molecular techniques such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. It is classified within the Enterobacteriaceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Escherichia, Salmonella, and Klebsiella.\n\nOverall, Cedecea davisae is a relatively rare and understudied bacterial species, but its potential clinical significance, particularly in immunocompromised patients, continues to be an area of ongoing research and investigation.",
