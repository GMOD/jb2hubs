  "description": "Bacteroides uniformis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It is a common member of the human gut microbiome, where it plays a role in the breakdown and fermentation of complex carbohydrates and dietary fibers.\n\nBacteroides uniformis cells are typically rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are chemoorganotrophic, meaning they obtain energy through the oxidation of organic compounds. The species is known to be versatile in its metabolic capabilities, able to utilize a wide range of carbohydrates and other organic substrates for growth.\n\nWithin the human gut, Bacteroides uniformis contributes to the maintenance of a healthy and balanced microbiome. It is involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids, which serve as important energy sources for the host and can have beneficial effects on gut and overall health. Additionally, Bacteroides uniformis has been studied for its potential roles in immune system modulation and the prevention of certain gastrointestinal disorders.",
