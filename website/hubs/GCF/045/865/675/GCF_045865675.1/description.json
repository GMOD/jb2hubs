  "description": "Candidatus Magnetaquiglobus chichijimensis is a recently discovered, uncultivated species of magnetotactic bacteria. These bacteria are known for their ability to biomineralize magnetic nanoparticles, called magnetosomes, within their cells, which allow them to orient and navigate using the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nCandidatus Magnetaquiglobus chichijimensis was first identified in sediment samples collected from the Chichijima Island in the Ogasawara Archipelago, Japan. It belongs to the Magnetoaqua-like bacteria, a group of magnetotactic bacteria found in aquatic environments.\n\nCharacteristic features of Candidatus Magnetaquiglobus chichijimensis include its spherical or quasi-spherical cell morphology and the presence of a single, polar flagellum for motility. The magnetosomes within the cells are arranged in a single chain, which helps the bacteria align and navigate along the Earth's magnetic field lines.\n\nThis species is currently classified as an uncultivated and uncultured bacterium, meaning that it has not yet been successfully grown in a laboratory setting. Its ecological roles and interactions within the microbial communities it inhabits are still under investigation, but its unique magnetotactic abilities make it a subject of interest for studies on microbial magnetoreception and potential applications in bioengineering and bioremediation.",
