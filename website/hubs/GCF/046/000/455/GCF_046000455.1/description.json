  "description": "Chryseobacterium terrae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Chryseobacterium terrae are rod-shaped and typically measure between 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length. They are motile, with gliding motility.\n\nChryseobacterium terrae is considered a soil bacterium, as it was originally isolated from soil samples. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C.\n\nThis species is characterized by its ability to produce yellow-pigmented colonies on agar media due to the production of carotenoid pigments. It is also known to be capable of hydrolyzing various substrates, such as starch, casein, and Tween 80.\n\nPhylogenetically, Chryseobacterium terrae belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is closely related to other species within the genus Chryseobacterium, which are commonly found in various environmental samples, including soil, water, and plant materials.",
