  "description": "Caballeronia jiangsuensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Jiangsu Province, China. It belongs to the genus Caballeronia, which is a member of the family Burkholderiaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nCaballeronia jiangsuensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 5.5 to 8.5.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Caballeronia jiangsuensis is closely related to other Caballeronia species, such as Caballeronia telluris and Caballeronia humi. The genome of Caballeronia jiangsuensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic and metabolic potential.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological role and potential applications of Caballeronia jiangsuensis in various environments.",
