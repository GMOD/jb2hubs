  "description": "Aequorivita nionensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a soil sample collected in Nion, France. It belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nAequorivita nionensis is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Cells are rod-shaped and motile. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aequorivita nionensis is most closely related to other species within the genus Aequorivita, which are commonly found in various marine and soil environments.\n\nThis species is able to hydrolyze starch and casein, and it can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth. Aequorivita nionensis is also reported to produce carotenoid pigments, which contribute to its distinctive yellow-orange colony color.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles and potential applications of this bacterial species isolated from the terrestrial environment.",
