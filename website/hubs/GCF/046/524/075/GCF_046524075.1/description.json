  "description": "Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Bacillus genus. It is a widely studied strain of B. cereus, which is a common soil-dwelling microorganism.\n\nSome key characteristics of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 include:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are approximately 1-1.2 μm wide and 3-5 μm long, with the ability to form oval-shaped endospores.\n\n2. Growth requirements: It is an aerobic bacterium that can grow in a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 50°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30-37°C. It can also tolerate a wide pH range, from 4.9 to 9.3.\n\n3. Metabolism: Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is a chemoorganotroph, meaning it obtains energy and carbon from organic compounds. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, amino acids, and other organic substrates for growth.\n\n4. Toxin production: This strain is known to produce several toxins, including emetic and diarrheal toxins, which can cause food poisoning in humans if consumed in contaminated food.\n\n5. Genomic features: The complete genome of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome of approximately 5.4 million base pairs with a G+C content of around 35%.\n\nBacillus cereus ATCC 14579 is widely used as a model organism for the study of Bacillus species, particularly in the areas of sporulation, toxin production, and pathogenesis.",
