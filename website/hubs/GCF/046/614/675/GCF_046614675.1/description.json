  "description": "Chryseobacterium cupriresistens is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum. This species was first isolated from a copper-contaminated soil sample collected in China.\n\nChryseobacterium cupriresistens is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It has a distinctive yellow pigmentation due to the production of carotenoid compounds. Colonies of this species appear smooth, circular, and convex on agar plates.\n\nOne of the unique features of Chryseobacterium cupriresistens is its ability to resist and tolerate high concentrations of copper. This copper-resistant property is believed to be an adaptation to the copper-contaminated environment from which it was initially isolated. The mechanisms underlying this copper resistance are not yet fully understood but may involve the expression of specialized copper-binding proteins or efflux systems.\n\nChryseobacterium cupriresistens is considered a non-pathogenic bacterium and has not been reported to cause any known human or animal diseases. However, its potential applications in bioremediation and environmental cleanup of copper-contaminated sites are actively being explored.",
