  "description": "Trachinotus anak, commonly known as the Anak pompano, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Carangidae. It is found in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, and the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Anak pompano is a small to medium-sized fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 30 centimeters (12 inches). It has a streamlined, laterally compressed body shape and a small, protruding mouth. The fish's coloration is typically silvery-gray with a bluish-green back and white belly.\n\nThe Anak pompano is a carnivorous fish, feeding primarily on small crustaceans, mollusks, and other small marine organisms. It is often found in schools or small groups, inhabiting coastal areas, estuaries, and reef environments.\n\nReproduction in the Anak pompano involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a pelagic larval stage before settling into their adult habitat.\n\nThe Anak pompano is considered a valuable food fish in some regions and is sometimes targeted by recreational and commercial fisheries. It is also of interest to aquarium enthusiasts due to its attractive appearance and relatively small size.",
