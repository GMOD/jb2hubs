  "description": "Brucella ceti is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Brucella, a group of gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogens. Brucella ceti is primarily found in marine mammals, such as cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), and is known to cause brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to humans.\n\nThe bacterium is a small, coccobacillary or short-rod shaped microorganism that is able to survive and replicate within the host's phagocytic cells, such as macrophages. Brucella ceti is closely related to other Brucella species, but it has distinct genetic and phenotypic characteristics that differentiate it from the terrestrial Brucella species.\n\nInfection with Brucella ceti in marine mammals can lead to a range of clinical manifestations, including reproductive disorders, such as abortions, stillbirths, and infertility, as well as other systemic complications. In humans, exposure to Brucella ceti can result in a disease similar to the classical form of brucellosis, with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and joint pain.\n\nIdentification and diagnosis of Brucella ceti infections typically involve serological tests, molecular techniques, such as PCR, and culture-based methods. Appropriate control and prevention measures, including surveillance, hygiene practices, and proper handling of marine mammal tissues, are crucial to mitigate the transmission of this zoonotic pathogen.",
