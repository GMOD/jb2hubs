  "description": "Acetobacterium dehalogenans DSM 11527 is a species of anaerobic bacteria that belongs to the Acetobacterium genus. This bacterium was first isolated from a denitrifying bioreactor and is known for its ability to dehalogenate, or remove halogen atoms, from various organic compounds.\n\nThe key features of Acetobacterium dehalogenans DSM 11527 are:\n\n1. Anaerobic metabolism: As an anaerobic bacterium, it can grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen, utilizing alternative electron acceptors for energy production.\n\n2. Dehalogenation capability: This species is capable of removing halogen atoms, such as chlorine or bromine, from organic molecules through enzymatic processes. This ability makes it potentially useful in bioremediation of halogenated environmental pollutants.\n\n3. Phylogenetic classification: Acetobacterium dehalogenans DSM 11527 is classified within the Acetobacterium genus, which is part of the Firmicutes phylum of Gram-positive bacteria.\n\n4. Cultivation and growth: The bacterium can be cultivated in the laboratory using specialized anaerobic media and growth conditions. Its optimal growth temperature is typically around 30Â°C.\n\nOverall, Acetobacterium dehalogenans DSM 11527 is a environmentally relevant bacterium known for its unique dehalogenation capabilities, which can be of interest in various applications, such as bioremediation and biotransformation processes.",
