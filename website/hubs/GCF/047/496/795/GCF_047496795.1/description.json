  "description": "Chiloscyllium punctatum, commonly known as the brownbanded bamboo shark, is a species of shark belonging to the family Hemiscylliidae. It is a small, benthic shark found in the coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region, including the waters of Southeast Asia, northern Australia, and the western Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe brownbanded bamboo shark is characterized by its elongated, slender body and a distinctive pattern of dark brown bands or spots on a lighter brown or yellowish background. It has a flattened head and a rounded snout, with a pair of small, forward-facing eyes and a subterminal mouth. This species typically grows to a maximum length of around 90 centimeters (35 inches).\n\nChiloscyllium punctatum is known to be a nocturnal and solitary species, often found resting on the seafloor or hiding in caves, crevices, or under coral ledges during the day. It feeds primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. The brownbanded bamboo shark is considered a relatively docile species and is not known to pose a significant threat to humans.\n\nThis species is of commercial importance in some regions, where it is targeted for its meat, fins, and oil. It is also sometimes kept in public aquariums due to its relatively small size and gentle nature. However, population declines have been observed in certain areas, leading to its classification as \"Near Threatened\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
