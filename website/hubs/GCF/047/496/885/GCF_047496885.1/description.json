  "description": "Scyliorhinus torazame, commonly known as the Japanese catshark or Torazame catshark, is a species of small shark belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae. It is found in the western Pacific Ocean, primarily along the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China.\n\nThe Japanese catshark is a small, slender-bodied shark, typically reaching a maximum length of around 60 centimeters (24 inches). It has a distinctive pattern of dark saddle-like markings along its back and sides, which help distinguish it from other catsharks in its range. The species has two small dorsal fins, and its snout is relatively short and rounded.\n\nScyliorhinus torazame is a benthic species, meaning it spends most of its time dwelling on or near the seafloor, often in shallow coastal waters or on the continental shelf. It primarily feeds on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and mollusks. The Japanese catshark is ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs hatch inside the female's body, and the young are born live.\n\nDue to its relatively small size and limited distribution, the Japanese catshark is not considered a commercially important species. However, it may face some localized threats from coastal development and fishing activities within its range. The species is currently listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
