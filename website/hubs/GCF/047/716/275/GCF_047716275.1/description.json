  "description": "Strix uralensis, commonly known as the Ural owl, is a species of large owl native to the forests of northern Eurasia. It belongs to the family Strigidae, which includes true owls.\n\nThe Ural owl is a medium-to-large-sized owl, with a body length of 45-60 cm and a wingspan of 100-130 cm. It has a distinctive facial disc with dark eyes and a hooked beak. The plumage is predominantly grayish-brown, with white spots and bars on the wings and tail. This coloration provides effective camouflage in the owl's forested habitat.\n\nStrix uralensis is a nocturnal and largely sedentary species, though some populations may undertake seasonal movements. It primarily feeds on small to medium-sized mammals, such as voles, mice, and small birds. The owl hunts from perches, using its excellent low-light vision and silent flight to locate and capture its prey.\n\nUral owls are territorial and monogamous, with pairs often mating for life. They typically nest in tree cavities or abandoned nests of other birds. The female lays 2-5 eggs and incubates them for around 30 days, while the male provides food for the female and the nestlings.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across the boreal and temperate forests of Northern and Central Europe, extending eastward to the Pacific coast of Russia. The Ural owl is generally considered a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though some local populations may face threats from habitat loss and fragmentation.",
