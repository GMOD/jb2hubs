  "description": "Azonexus caeni is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Betaproteobacteria, and order Burkholderiales. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nAzonexus caeni was first isolated from activated sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant in China. It is capable of growing on a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including glucose, sucrose, and various organic acids.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Azonexus caeni is closely related to other members of the genus Azonexus, which are commonly found in soil and aquatic environments. The genus Azonexus is characterized by its ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite and to degrade aromatic compounds.\n\nThe specific ecological role and function of Azonexus caeni in natural or engineered environments, such as wastewater treatment systems, are still under investigation. Further studies are needed to elucidate the physiological and metabolic capabilities of this bacterial species and its potential applications in environmental biotechnology.",
