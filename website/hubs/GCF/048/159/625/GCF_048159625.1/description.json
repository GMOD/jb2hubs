  "description": "Ciceribacter azotifigens is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the rhizosphere of chickpea (Cicer arietinum) plants. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. The distinguishing feature of C. azotifigens is its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which means it can convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into a more usable form of nitrogen, such as ammonia (NH3), through a process called biological nitrogen fixation.\n\nThis nitrogen-fixing capability makes C. azotifigens an interesting bacterium in the context of sustainable agriculture, as it can potentially contribute to the nitrogen nutrition of leguminous crops like chickpea, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. The species was first described and named in 2017 by a team of researchers in India.",
