  "description": "Canis lupus baileyi, also known as the Mexican gray wolf or the Southwestern gray wolf, is a subspecies of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) that is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\nPhysically, Canis lupus baileyi is smaller and more slender than other gray wolf subspecies, with a more pointed muzzle and smaller, rounded ears. They typically have a reddish-brown or grayish-brown coat, with some individuals displaying black or white markings. The average weight of an adult Mexican gray wolf ranges from 50 to 90 pounds (23 to 41 kg).\n\nEcologically, Canis lupus baileyi is an apex predator that plays a crucial role in the balance of the ecosystems it inhabits. They primarily prey on large ungulates, such as deer, elk, and pronghorn, but also consume smaller mammals, birds, and even carrion. The Mexican gray wolf is known for its social nature, living in family packs and exhibiting complex communication and hunting strategies.\n\nOnce widespread throughout the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, the Mexican gray wolf population was nearly extirpated in the 20th century due to human-caused mortality, including hunting, trapping, and poisoning. Conservation efforts, including captive breeding and reintroduction programs, have helped to slowly restore the subspecies' population, though it remains endangered and is the focus of ongoing recovery efforts.",
