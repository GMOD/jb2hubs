It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and has been introduced to North America.\n\nThe plant is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The stems are erect, branched, and can grow up to 80 cm in height. The flowers are white and have five petals, which are deeply divided, giving the appearance of ten petals. The flowers are typically dioecious, meaning that individual plants are either male or female.\n\nSilene latifolia is adapted to a variety of habitats, including disturbed areas, grasslands, and roadsides. It reproduces both sexually, through the production of seeds, and asexually, through the formation of rhizomes. The plant is known to be an important food source for various insects, including moths and butterflies, which feed on the nectar.\n\nSilene latifolia has been used in various scientific studies, particularly in the field of evolutionary biology, as it exhibits interesting sex chromosome evolution and has been used as a model organism for the study of plant-pollinator interactions.",
