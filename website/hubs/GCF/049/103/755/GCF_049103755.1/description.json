  "description": "Aquihabitans daechungensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a freshwater lake located in Daechung, South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically within the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Aquihabitans daechungensis are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and light yellow in color.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquihabitans daechungensis is most closely related to members of the genus Roseovarius, which are also found in aquatic environments. However, Aquihabitans daechungensis can be distinguished from Roseovarius species by its unique physiological and biochemical characteristics.\n\nThis bacterium is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH values, from 6.0 to 9.0, with an optimal pH of 7.0-8.0. Aquihabitans daechungensis is also capable of utilizing a variety of carbon sources for energy and growth, including various carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids.\n\nThe discovery and characterization of Aquihabitans daechungensis contribute to our understanding of the microbial diversity and ecological roles of bacteria in freshwater lake environments.",
