  "description": "Deferribacter abyssi is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Deferribacteres phylum. It was first isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent located in the Pacific Ocean, at a depth of approximately 2,700 meters.\n\nDeferribacter abyssi is a chemoheterotrophic, anaerobic, and motile bacterium. It is capable of using a variety of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates and amino acids, as sources of energy and carbon. The bacterium is also able to reduce elemental sulfur and ferric iron, which are important metabolic processes in deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments.\n\nMorphologically, Deferribacter abyssi cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length. The cells are Gram-negative and possess a single polar flagellum, which enables their motility.\n\nDeferribacter abyssi is adapted to the high-pressure, high-temperature, and chemically-complex conditions found in deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. Its unique metabolic capabilities and adaptations make it an interesting subject for research on microbial diversity and the functioning of deep-sea environments.",
