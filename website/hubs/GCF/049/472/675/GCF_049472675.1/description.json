  "description": "Deferribacter thermophilus is a species of thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria that was first isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent located in the Okinawa Trough, Japan. This bacterium is a gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganism that belongs to the Deferribacteres phylum.\n\nThe key features of Deferribacter thermophilus are:\n\n1. Thermophilic nature: It is capable of growing at high temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature range of 55-65Â°C.\n\n2. Anaerobic metabolism: Deferribacter thermophilus is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\n3. Dissimilatory metal reduction: This bacterium has the ability to use various metal ions, such as iron and manganese, as terminal electron acceptors during its anaerobic respiration.\n\n4. Chemolithoautotrophic growth: Deferribacter thermophilus can obtain its energy by oxidizing inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen or sulfur, and using carbon dioxide as its carbon source.\n\n5. Phylogenetic placement: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Deferribacter thermophilus is classified within the Deferribacteres phylum, which is a relatively small and understudied group of bacteria.\n\nDeferribacter thermophilus and other members of the Deferribacteres phylum are of interest to researchers due to their unique metabolic capabilities and potential applications in bioremediation, biogeochemical cycling, and biotechnology.",
