  "description": "Ampullimonas aquatilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Ampullimonas aquatilis is typically found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and marine habitats.\n\nThe cells of Ampullimonas aquatilis are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of approximately 0.5-1.5 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. The cells are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum, which enables their movement in the aquatic environment.\n\nPhylogenetically, Ampullimonas aquatilis is classified within the class Gammaproteobacteria and is closely related to other genera within the family Pseudomonadaceae. The species was first isolated and described from a freshwater sample collected in Japan.\n\nAmpullimonas aquatilis is known to be capable of oxidizing various organic compounds, including carbohydrates, alcohols, and amino acids, as sources of energy and carbon. Its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the aquatic environment make it an interesting subject for further research in microbial ecology and biogeochemical cycling.",
