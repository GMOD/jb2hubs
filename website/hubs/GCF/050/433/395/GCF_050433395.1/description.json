  "description": "Anaerotaenia torta is a species of parasitic tapeworm that belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes, class Cestoda. It is an endoparasite, primarily infecting the intestines of various fish species as its definitive host.\n\nThe tapeworm's body is composed of a scolex (head) with suckers or hooks for attachment, followed by a series of proglottids (segments) that contain the reproductive organs. The proglottids mature and detach from the main body, allowing the tapeworm to reproduce and disseminate its eggs through the host's feces.\n\nAnaerotaenia torta has a complex life cycle, involving an intermediate host, such as a crustacean, where the larval stage (procercoid) develops before being ingested by the definitive fish host. Inside the fish, the procercoid matures into the adult tapeworm, completing the life cycle.\n\nThis tapeworm species is known to infect a variety of freshwater and marine fish, and its distribution is primarily limited to specific geographical regions where the suitable host species are found.",
