  "description": "Candidatus Pantoea rara is a proposed species of bacteria that has been identified through metagenomics analysis. It belongs to the genus Pantoea, which is a member of the family Erwiniaceae within the Gammaproteobacteria class.\n\nCandidatus Pantoea rara is considered a candidate species, meaning its existence and taxonomic classification have been proposed but not yet officially validated and accepted by the scientific community. The name \"Candidatus Pantoea rara\" translates to \"the proposed rare Pantoea species.\"\n\nThis bacterial species has been detected in various environmental samples, such as soil and sediments, through the analysis of DNA sequences obtained directly from these samples, without the need for cultivation in a laboratory. The genome of Candidatus Pantoea rara has been partially reconstructed from these metagenomic data, providing insights into its potential metabolic capabilities and ecological roles.\n\nHowever, due to the lack of a cultured isolate, the detailed physiological and biochemical characteristics of Candidatus Pantoea rara remain to be determined. Further research, including successful cultivation and isolation of this bacterium, would be necessary to fully understand its biology, ecological function, and potential significance in the environments where it has been detected.",
