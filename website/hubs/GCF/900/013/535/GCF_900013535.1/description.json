  "description": "Agrobacterium tomkonis CFBP 6623 is a species of bacterium that belongs to the Agrobacterium genus. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and motile bacterium. Agrobacterium tomkonis CFBP 6623 is known to be a plant pathogen, primarily affecting tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). This strain, CFBP 6623, was isolated from a diseased tomato plant. The bacterium is capable of inducing the formation of crown gall tumors on the host plant, which is a common symptom of Agrobacterium infection. Agrobacterium tomkonis CFBP 6623 has been the subject of research studies to understand its pathogenicity mechanisms and potential applications in biotechnology, particularly in the field of genetic engineering.",
