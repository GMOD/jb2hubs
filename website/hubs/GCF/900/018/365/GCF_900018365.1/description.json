  "description": "Apibacter mensalis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from the gut of a honey bee (Apis mellifera) and is considered a member of the gut microbiome of these important pollinators.\n\nApibacter mensalis is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. It is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. The bacterium is known to be motile, possessing flagella that allow it to move through its environment.\n\nGenome analysis has revealed that Apibacter mensalis has a relatively small genome size compared to other Bacteroidetes bacteria. Its genome encodes genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting it may play a role in the digestion and utilization of complex plant-derived compounds found in the honey bee gut.\n\nWhile the specific functions of Apibacter mensalis within the honey bee gut microbiome are not fully understood, studies suggest it may contribute to the overall health and fitness of the honey bee host. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise ecological and physiological interactions between this bacterium and its honey bee partner.",
