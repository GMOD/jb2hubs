  "description": "Candidatus Hoaglandella endobia is a recently discovered bacterial species that lives as an endosymbiont within certain species of ciliates, which are single-celled eukaryotic organisms. This bacterium was first identified and named after Richard Hoagland, a prominent American biochemist.\n\nCandidatus Hoaglandella endobia is classified as a member of the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically within the class Alphaproteobacteria. It is an obligate intracellular bacterium, meaning it can only survive and reproduce within the host ciliate cells. The bacterium is thought to have a mutualistic relationship with its host, providing metabolic benefits in exchange for a stable and nutrient-rich environment.\n\nThe genome of Candidatus Hoaglandella endobia is relatively small, suggesting a high degree of specialization and adaptation to its endosymbiotic lifestyle. Ongoing research aims to further understand the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary history behind this unique host-symbiont relationship.",
