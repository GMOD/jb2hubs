  "description": "Candidatus Mikella endobia is a recently discovered, uncultured bacterial species that is believed to be an endosymbiont, living within the cells of certain insects. It was first identified through metagenomic analysis of the bacterial communities associated with the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys).\n\nSome key features of Candidatus Mikella endobia:\n\n1. Classification: It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, within the class Bacteroidia.\n\n2. Endosymbiont: Candidatus Mikella endobia resides within the cells of its insect host, living in close association and likely providing some beneficial function to the host.\n\n3. Genome size: Its estimated genome size is around 1.2 Mb, indicating a small, streamlined genome typical of obligate endosymbionts.\n\n4. Metabolic capabilities: Analysis of the genome suggests that Candidatus Mikella endobia is likely involved in the synthesis of essential nutrients, such as vitamins and amino acids, which may benefit the host insect.\n\n5. Host specificity: So far, Candidatus Mikella endobia has only been found in association with the brown marmorated stink bug, suggesting a high degree of host specificity.\n\n6. Uncultured: Like many endosymbiotic bacteria, Candidatus Mikella endobia has not yet been successfully cultured in the laboratory, making it challenging to study its physiology and interactions with the host in greater detail.\n\nOverall, Candidatus Mikella endobia represents an interesting example of a bacterial endosymbiont that has evolved a close and potentially mutualistic relationship with its insect host, providing insights into the diversity and importance of microbial associations in the natural world.",
