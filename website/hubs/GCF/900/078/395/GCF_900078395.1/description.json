  "description": "Anaerotruncus rubiinfantis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium. It was first isolated from the fecal sample of a healthy infant. The cells of A. rubiinfantis are short, straight or slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. This species is non-motile and does not produce catalase or oxidase. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicates that A. rubiinfantis belongs to the Firmicutes phylum, specifically within the Ruminococcaceae family. As an anaerobic bacterium, A. rubiinfantis grows optimally under anaerobic conditions and utilizes carbohydrates as its primary energy source, producing acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen as the major fermentation end-products. This species has been found to be a member of the normal gut microbiota in healthy human infants, suggesting its potential role in early gut colonization and development.",
