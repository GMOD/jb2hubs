  "description": "Candidatus Ichthyocystis sparus is a recently discovered, uncultured bacterial species that has been found in association with certain marine fish species. It belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, which is a group of obligate intracellular bacteria known to infect a variety of eukaryotic hosts, including vertebrates, invertebrates, and protists.\n\nThe name \"Candidatus Ichthyocystis sparus\" refers to the fact that this bacterium has been observed to form intracellular inclusions or \"cysts\" within the cells of its fish host, specifically in the species Sparus aurata, also known as the gilthead seabream.\n\nWhile the exact nature of the relationship between Candidatus Ichthyocystis sparus and its fish host is not yet fully understood, it is believed to be a type of symbiotic or potentially pathogenic interaction. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific role and impact of this bacterium on the health and physiology of the gilthead seabream and other marine fish species.",
