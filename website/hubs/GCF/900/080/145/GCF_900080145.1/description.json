  "description": "Candidatus Tremblayella princeps is a recently discovered bacterial species that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It was first identified and named in 2019 based on genomic analysis of samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant.\n\nThe key features of Candidatus Tremblayella princeps are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium that typically forms long, chain-like cellular arrangements.\n\n2. Genome characteristics: The genome of Candidatus Tremblayella princeps is small, approximately 1.8 megabases in size, suggesting it may have a streamlined and specialized metabolism.\n\n3. Phylogenetic placement: Phylogenetic analysis places Candidatus Tremblayella princeps within the class Clostridia, specifically within the order Clostridiales, but it represents a distinct lineage within this group.\n\n4. Ecological niche: Candidatus Tremblayella princeps was initially detected in a wastewater treatment plant, indicating that it may play a role in the microbial community involved in wastewater treatment processes.\n\n5. Physiology and metabolism: Limited information is available on the specific physiological and metabolic capabilities of Candidatus Tremblayella princeps, as it has not yet been successfully cultured in the laboratory.\n\nOverall, Candidatus Tremblayella princeps is a newly discovered and not yet fully characterized bacterial species, which represents an addition to the diversity of microorganisms found in wastewater treatment systems and may contribute to our understanding of the complex microbial communities involved in these processes.",
