  "description": "Alistipes provencensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. It was first isolated from a human fecal sample collected in Provence, France, and subsequently classified as a novel species within the genus Alistipes.\n\nAlistipes provencensis is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Rikenellaceae. It is a strictly anaerobic organism, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth and metabolism. The cells of A. provencensis are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length, with a characteristic rod-shaped morphology.\n\nBiochemical and genetic analyses have revealed that A. provencensis is a distinct species, differentiated from other Alistipes species by its unique 16S rRNA gene sequence and various phenotypic characteristics, such as its ability to ferment certain carbohydrates and its susceptibility to specific antimicrobial agents.\n\nThe ecological role and potential clinical significance of Alistipes provencensis within the human gut microbiome are still under investigation, as further research is needed to understand its interactions with other gut microbiota and its potential association with human health or disease states.",
