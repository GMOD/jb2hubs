  "description": "Candidatus Accumulibacter aalborgensis is a recently discovered, uncultured bacterium that belongs to the Betaproteobacteria class. It was first identified and characterized through metagenomic analysis of activated sludge samples collected from a wastewater treatment plant in Aalborg, Denmark.\n\nThis bacterium is considered a member of the Candidatus Accumulibacter genus, a group of bacteria known for their ability to accumulate large amounts of polyphosphate within their cells. Candidatus A. aalborgensis is believed to play a key role in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process, which is a wastewater treatment strategy used to remove phosphorus from wastewater.\n\nThrough genomic analysis, Candidatus A. aalborgensis has been shown to possess the genetic machinery necessary for polyphosphate accumulation, as well as genes involved in the uptake and metabolism of volatile fatty acids, which are the primary carbon and energy sources for this bacterium in the EBPR process.\n\nWhile Candidatus A. aalborgensis has not yet been successfully cultured in the laboratory, its identification and characterization through metagenomic techniques have provided valuable insights into the diversity and functional capabilities of the Candidatus Accumulibacter group, and their importance in wastewater treatment processes.",
