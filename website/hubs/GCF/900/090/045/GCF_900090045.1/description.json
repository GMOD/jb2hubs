  "description": "Plasmodium malariae is a species of protozoan parasite that is the causative agent of one of the four major types of malaria in humans, known as quartan malaria. It is a member of the genus Plasmodium, which includes several other species that can infect humans and other vertebrates.\n\nP. malariae is transmitted by the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, which act as the vector for the parasite. The life cycle of P. malariae involves a complex series of stages, including the development of the parasite within the mosquito (the sporogonic cycle) and the subsequent infection and development within the human host (the exoerythrocytic and erythrocytic cycles).\n\nCompared to other Plasmodium species that cause malaria, P. malariae is characterized by a longer incubation period and a more chronic infection pattern, with periodic recurrences of fever and chills every 72 hours (the \"quartan\" pattern). P. malariae infections can persist for years or even decades in the human host, and can lead to serious complications, such as kidney damage and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen).\n\nEffective treatment and control of P. malariae infections are crucial, as the parasite can be difficult to eradicate and can contribute to ongoing transmission of malaria in endemic regions.",
