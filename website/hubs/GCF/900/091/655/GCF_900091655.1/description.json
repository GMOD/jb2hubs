  "description": "Culturomica massiliensis is a recently discovered bacterial species that belongs to the Bacteroidetes phylum. It was first isolated from a human stool sample collected in Marseille, France, which is where the species name \"massiliensis\" originates from.\n\nThis bacterium is a strictly anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile rod-shaped microorganism. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has placed C. massiliensis within the Bacteroidales order, specifically in the Bacteroidaceae family.\n\nCulturomic techniques, including the use of various culture media and incubation conditions, were essential for the successful isolation and identification of this previously unknown bacterial species. Further studies are needed to elucidate the ecological role, metabolic capabilities, and potential clinical or biotechnological significance of C. massiliensis within the human gut microbiome.",
