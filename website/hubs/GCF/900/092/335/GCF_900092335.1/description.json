  "description": "Corynebacterium phoceense is a species of Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. It belongs to the genus Corynebacterium, which is a group of bacteria commonly found in the human microbiome and can be associated with both commensal and pathogenic relationships.\n\nCorynebacterium phoceense was first isolated from the human oral cavity and has been detected in various human clinical samples, including the respiratory tract and skin. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe bacterium is characterized by its ability to grow on various laboratory media and can ferment a range of carbohydrates. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that Corynebacterium phoceense is closely related to other Corynebacterium species, but it can be distinguished by its unique biochemical and genomic characteristics.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecology, pathogenicity, and potential clinical significance of Corynebacterium phoceense in human health and disease.",
