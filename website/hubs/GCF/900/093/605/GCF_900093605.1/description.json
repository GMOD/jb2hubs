  "description": "Candidatus Terasakiella magnetica is a recently discovered species of magnetotactic bacteria. Magnetotactic bacteria are a unique group of prokaryotes that can biomineralize magnetic iron oxide or iron sulfide nanoparticles, known as magnetosomes, within their cells. These magnetosomes act as a compass, allowing the bacteria to navigate along the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nCandidatus Terasakiella magnetica was first identified through metagenomics analysis of sediment samples collected from a coastal tidal flat in Japan. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and is classified within the class Alphaproteobacteria. The genome analysis of Candidatus Terasakiella magnetica revealed the presence of genes responsible for the synthesis and organization of magnetosomes, indicating its ability to biomineralize magnetic nanoparticles.\n\nThis species is characterized by its small, coccoid or ovoid cell morphology and its ability to orient and swim along the Earth's magnetic field lines. Candidatus Terasakiella magnetica represents a novel lineage within the diverse group of magnetotactic bacteria, contributing to our understanding of the evolutionary and ecological significance of these unique microorganisms in various aquatic environments.",
