  "description": "Acidaminococcus massiliensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, coccoid-shaped bacterium that was first isolated from a human stool sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the genus Acidaminococcus, which is a member of the Veillonellaceae family within the Firmicutes phylum.\n\nThe key features of Acidaminococcus massiliensis are:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a coccoid-shaped bacterium, approximately 0.8-1.2 Î¼m in diameter.\n\n2. Metabolism: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is able to ferment amino acids, particularly aspartate and glutamate, as its primary energy sources.\n\n3. Habitat: Acidaminococcus massiliensis is a gut commensal, typically found in the human gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon.\n\n4. Genome: The genome of Acidaminococcus massiliensis has been sequenced, revealing a circular chromosome of approximately 2.4 million base pairs.\n\n5. Phylogeny: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Acidaminococcus massiliensis is closely related to other species within the Acidaminococcus genus.\n\nOverall, Acidaminococcus massiliensis is an anaerobic, amino acid-fermenting bacterium that is part of the normal human gut microbiome and plays a role in the metabolism of amino acids in the intestinal environment.",
