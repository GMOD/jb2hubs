  "description": "Chryseobacterium taeanense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Taean, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe cells of C. taeanense are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are yellow-pigmented, smooth, and circular in shape.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that C. taeanense is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, such as Chryseobacterium indologenes and Chryseobacterium joostei. However, it can be distinguished from these related species by its unique biochemical and physiological characteristics.\n\nC. taeanense is an aerobic bacterium that is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C. It is also capable of hydrolyzing a variety of substrates, including casein, gelatin, and Tween 80.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of C. taeanense are not yet fully understood, but as a member of the Chryseobacterium genus, it may have potential for use in various biotechnological and environmental applications, such as bioremediation or the production of industrially relevant enzymes.",
