  "description": "Agrococcus jejuensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Actinobacteria class. It was first isolated from soil collected on Jeju Island, South Korea.\n\nAgrococcus jejuensis is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium. It is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth. The cells typically appear in pairs or tetrads.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Agrococcus jejuensis is closely related to other Agrococcus species, which are commonly found in soil and plant-associated environments.\n\nThe optimal growth temperature for Agrococcus jejuensis is reported to be around 25-30Â°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH conditions, growing well at pH values between 6.0 and 9.0.\n\nAgrococcus jejuensis has the ability to hydrolyze various compounds, such as casein, gelatin, and starch, indicating its potential role in the cycling of organic matter in the environment. Its ecological function and potential applications are still under investigation.",
