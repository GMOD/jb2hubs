  "description": "Aliiruegeria lutimaris is a species of bacteria that was isolated from tidal flat sediment collected from the Yellow Sea coast in South Korea. It belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nSome key scientific features of Aliiruegeria lutimaris are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile.\n\n2. Colony characteristics: The colonies on agar plates are circular, convex, smooth, and yellow-pigmented.\n\n3. Physiological properties: The optimal growth temperature is 25-30°C and the optimal pH is 7.0-8.0. It can hydrolyze starch, casein, and Tween 80.\n\n4. Chemotaxonomic characteristics: The major fatty acids are iso-C15:0, C16:1ω7c, and C16:0. The predominant respiratory quinone is menaquinone-7 (MK-7).\n\n5. Phylogenetic analysis: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Aliiruegeria lutimaris is most closely related to other members of the genus Aliiruegeria within the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nThis species was first described in 2012 and the name \"lutimaris\" refers to its isolation from tidal flat sediment (lutum means mud or silt, and mare means sea in Latin).",
