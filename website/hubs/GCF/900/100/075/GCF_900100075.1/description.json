  "description": "Chryseobacterium jejuense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Jeju Island, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nSome key characteristics of Chryseobacterium jejuense:\n\n1. Colony morphology: The colonies on agar plates are yellow-pigmented, circular, and convex in shape.\n\n2. Physiology: The bacterium is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for growth. It is also catalase-positive and oxidase-positive.\n\n3. Chemotaxonomy: Analysis of the cellular fatty acid composition and quinone system indicates that this species belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is a member of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\n4. Genomic features: The G+C content of the genomic DNA is around 37-38 mol%.\n\n5. Habitat and isolation: Chryseobacterium jejuense was originally isolated from soil samples collected from Jeju Island, a volcanic island located off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula. It is likely adapted to survive in soil environments.\n\n6. Taxonomy: Based on phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, Chryseobacterium jejuense is most closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, such as Chryseobacterium indoltheticum and Chryseobacterium joostei.\n\nThis brief description highlights the key microbiological and taxonomic characteristics of Chryseobacterium jejuense, a bacterium isolated from the unique environment of Jeju Island in South Korea.",
