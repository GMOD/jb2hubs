  "description": "Chryseobacterium soldanellicola is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the rhizosphere (the soil surrounding plant roots) of the seaside plant Soldanella (also known as the snowbell or alpine snowbell). It was discovered and characterized by researchers in South Korea.\n\nChryseobacterium soldanellicola is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It appears as yellow-pigmented, smooth, and circular colonies when grown on agar plates. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that C. soldanellicola belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThis bacterium is capable of hydrolyzing several macromolecules, such as casein, gelatin, and Tween 80, suggesting it may play a role in the decomposition of organic matter in the plant's rhizosphere. Further studies may explore the potential ecological functions and potential applications of this Chryseobacterium species isolated from the unique environment of the Soldanella plant's root zone.",
