  "description": "Dolosicoccus paucivorans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccus-shaped microorganism. Dolosicoccus paucivorans is an obligately anaerobic bacterium, meaning it requires an environment devoid of oxygen to grow and thrive.\n\nThis species was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of a human patient. It is considered a fastidious organism, as it has specific nutritional requirements and is challenging to cultivate in the laboratory. Dolosicoccus paucivorans is known to ferment a limited range of carbohydrates, producing lactic acid as the primary end product of its metabolism.\n\nThe exact ecological roles and significance of Dolosicoccus paucivorans within the human gut microbiome are still under investigation. Further research is needed to understand its potential interactions with other gut microbial communities and its potential implications for human health.",
