  "description": "Belnapia rosea is a species of fungus that belongs to the order Tremellales within the phylum Basidiomycota. It is a pink-colored, gelatinous fungus that typically grows on dead wood or decaying plant material. The fruiting bodies of B. rosea are often described as having a brain-like or cerebrum-like appearance, with a wrinkled, undulating surface. The fungus reproduces sexually through the production of basidiospores, which are dispersed by wind or other means. B. rosea is known to be a saprotroph, meaning it obtains its nutrients by decomposing organic matter in its environment. The species is widely distributed, with reported occurrences in various regions across the globe, including Europe, North America, and Asia.",
