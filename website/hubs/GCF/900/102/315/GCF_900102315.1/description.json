  "description": "Celeribacter baekdonensis is a species of bacteria that was isolated from soil samples collected at Baekdudaegan National Arboretum, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium.\n\nMorphologically, C. baekdonensis cells are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. baekdonensis belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Alphaproteobacteria, order Rhodobacterales, and family Rhodobacteraceae. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that it is most closely related to the genus Celeribacter, with the type species Celeribacter halophilus.\n\nThe genome of C. baekdonensis has been sequenced and found to be approximately 3.9 Mb in size. Analysis of the genome has provided insights into the metabolic capabilities and potential ecological roles of this bacterium in the soil environment.\n\nOverall, Celeribacter baekdonensis is a recently described bacterial species that contributes to our understanding of the diversity and functions of microorganisms in soil ecosystems.",
