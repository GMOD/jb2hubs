  "description": "Afifella marina DSM 2698 is a species of marine bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It was first isolated from a seawater sample collected in the coastal region of Afif, Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfifella marina DSM 2698 is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. It is aerobic, meaning it requires oxygen for its growth and metabolism. The cells are typically rod-shaped and measure around 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences have shown that Afifella marina DSM 2698 is closely related to other members of the genus Afifella, which are commonly found in marine environments. The genus Afifella is classified within the class Alphaproteobacteria, and it is known to be involved in various biogeochemical processes in the ocean.\n\nAfifella marina DSM 2698 is capable of utilizing a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, and it can grow at a range of temperatures and salinities typical of marine habitats. Further research is needed to elucidate the specific ecological roles and metabolic capabilities of this bacterial species in the marine ecosystem.",
