  "description": "Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans DSM 2784 is a species of anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from a mesophilic anaerobic bioreactor treating industrial wastewater.\n\nThis bacterium is characterized by its ability to ferment amino acids, particularly glutamate, and produce hydrogen as a major end-product of its metabolism. It is a non-spore-forming, non-motile, and curved rod-shaped organism.\n\nAcidaminobacter hydrogenoformans DSM 2784 is considered an important member of the microbial community in anaerobic digesters and bioreactors, as it plays a role in the breakdown of organic matter and the production of hydrogen, which can be utilized as a biofuel.\n\nThe strain DSM 2784 was deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) culture collection, which serves as a reference for this species.",
