  "description": "Allisonella histaminiformans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, and spore-forming bacterium. Allisonella histaminiformans was first isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract and is known to be involved in the production of histamine, a biogenic amine with important physiological functions.\n\nThe cells of Allisonella histaminiformans are typically rod-shaped and can form endospores, which allow the bacteria to survive in harsh environmental conditions. This species is classified as a member of the family Peptostreptococcaceae, which are commonly found in the human gut microbiome.\n\nAllisonella histaminiformans is known to possess the genetic machinery necessary for the decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine, leading to the production of histamine. This metabolic capability can have implications for human health, as disruptions in histamine homeostasis have been associated with various gastrointestinal and immunological disorders.\n\nThe precise ecological roles and interactions of Allisonella histaminiformans within the complex gut microbiome are still being investigated, and further research is needed to elucidate its potential impact on human health and disease.",
