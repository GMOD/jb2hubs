  "description": "Desulforhopalus singaporensis is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was first isolated from a marine sediment sample collected in Singapore. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and chemoheterotrophic bacterium.\n\nSome key characteristics of Desulforhopalus singaporensis:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are rod-shaped, approximately 1.0-1.5 μm in length and 0.4-0.6 μm in width.\n\n2. Metabolism: Desulforhopalus singaporensis is a sulfate-reducing bacterium, meaning it can use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration. It can utilize a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and hydrogen, as electron donors.\n\n3. Growth conditions: The bacterium is mesophilic, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C. It can grow in a wide range of salinities, from 0.5% to 10% NaCl.\n\n4. Phylogenetic affiliation: Desulforhopalus singaporensis belongs to the class Deltaproteobacteria, within the order Desulfobacterales, and the family Desulfobulbaceae.\n\n5. Ecological role: As a sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulforhopalus singaporensis plays a role in the sulfur cycle in marine sediments, contributing to the cycling of sulfur and the production of hydrogen sulfide.\n\nThis species was initially isolated from a marine sediment sample and has been studied for its potential role in biogeochemical processes in coastal and estuarine environments.",
