  "description": "Alterileibacterium massiliense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human stool sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the family Ruminococcaceae.\n\nThe cells of Alterileibacterium massiliense are Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are coccoid or slightly elongated in shape, with a diameter ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 micrometers.\n\nGenomic analysis has revealed that Alterileibacterium massiliense has a circular chromosome with a size of approximately 2.7 million base pairs and a G+C content of around 54%. The genome encodes various metabolic pathways, including the ability to ferment carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids.\n\nThis bacterium is considered a member of the human gut microbiome and has been found to be present in relatively low abundance in healthy individuals. Its potential role in human health and disease is an ongoing area of research.",
