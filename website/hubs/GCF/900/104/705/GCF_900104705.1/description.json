  "description": "Agrococcus carbonis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Agrococcus. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming coccus. The cells of A. carbonis are typically arranged in pairs or irregular clusters.\n\nThis species was first isolated from soil samples collected from a coal mine in China. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C. A. carbonis can tolerate a wide range of pH conditions, growing well in the pH range of 5.5 to 9.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that A. carbonis is closely related to other Agrococcus species, such as Agrococcus jenensis and Agrococcus citreus. However, it can be differentiated from these closely related species based on phenotypic characteristics and DNA-DNA hybridization studies.\n\nThe specific ecological role and potential applications of A. carbonis are not yet well-studied, as it is a relatively newly described species. Further research is needed to understand its metabolic capabilities, interactions within microbial communities, and potential biotechnological or environmental significance.",
