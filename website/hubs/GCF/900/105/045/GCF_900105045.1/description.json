  "description": "Brevibacterium sandarakinum is a species of gram-positive, aerobic bacteria that belongs to the genus Brevibacterium. It was first isolated from soil samples collected in Sandaraka, Japan.\n\nThe cells of B. sandarakinum are non-spore-forming, non-motile, and coccoid to short-rod shaped. They typically measure around 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetically, B. sandarakinum is closely related to other Brevibacterium species, and it is classified within the phylum Actinobacteria. The optimal growth temperature for this bacterium is around 30°C, and it can grow in the presence of up to 7% NaCl.\n\nBiochemically, B. sandarakinum is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose. The cell wall contains peptidoglycan, and the major fatty acids present are branched-chain, such as anteiso-C15:0 and iso-C16:0.\n\nThe exact ecological roles and functions of B. sandarakinum in its natural soil environment are not yet fully understood, but the species is believed to play a role in nutrient cycling and decomposition processes.",
