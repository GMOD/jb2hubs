  "description": "Desulfobacula phenolica is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a freshwater sediment sample. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nThe key features of Desulfobacula phenolica are:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is capable of utilizing phenol as a sole carbon and energy source, coupling its oxidation to the reduction of sulfate to sulfide. This ability to degrade aromatic compounds like phenol is an important characteristic of this species.\n\n2. Physiology: It is a mesophilic organism, growing optimally at temperatures around 30Â°C. It can tolerate a wide range of pH, growing well between pH 6.5 to 8.0.\n\n3. Phylogeny: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has placed Desulfobacula phenolica within the Deltaproteobacteria class, specifically within the Desulfobacteraceae family.\n\n4. Ecology: As a sulfate-reducer, Desulfobacula phenolica plays a role in the sulfur cycle in freshwater sedimentary environments where it can degrade aromatic pollutants coupled to sulfate reduction.\n\nOverall, Desulfobacula phenolica is an environmentally relevant bacterium capable of anaerobic degradation of phenolic compounds, making it of interest for bioremediation applications in contaminated aquatic ecosystems.",
