  "description": "Acidovorax soli is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Proteobacteria phylum, specifically within the Betaproteobacteria class. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Acidovorax soli are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen for growth and metabolism.\n\nAcidovorax soli was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. It is classified as a member of the Acidovorax genus, which is known for its ability to degrade a variety of organic compounds and participate in various biogeochemical cycles in the environment.\n\nThis species has been reported to exhibit plant growth-promoting activities, and it has been studied for its potential applications in agriculture and bioremediation. Further research is ongoing to better understand the ecological roles and biotechnological potential of Acidovorax soli.",
