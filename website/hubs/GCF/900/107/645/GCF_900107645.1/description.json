  "description": "Desulfuromusa kysingii is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was first isolated from marine sediments. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and motile bacterium that belongs to the class Deltaproteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Desulfuromusa kysingii are curved rods, typically measuring around 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are capable of using a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors for the reduction of sulfate to sulfide.\n\nThis species is chemoheterotrophic, meaning it derives its energy and carbon from the oxidation of organic compounds. It is also capable of utilizing hydrogen as an electron donor for sulfate reduction.\n\nDesulfuromusa kysingii is considered an important member of the microbial community in marine sediments, where it plays a role in the cycling of sulfur and the degradation of organic matter. It has been found in a variety of marine environments, including coastal sediments, deep-sea sediments, and hydrothermal vents.",
