  "description": "Alistipes timonensis JC136 is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from a human stool sample. It belongs to the genus Alistipes, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe cells of Alistipes timonensis JC136 are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. They are non-pigmented and do not possess flagella. The bacterium is strictly anaerobic, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen.\n\nAlistipes timonensis JC136 is considered a fastidious organism, requiring complex growth media for cultivation in the laboratory. It is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as part of its metabolism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Alistipes timonensis JC136 is closely related to other Alistipes species, but it can be distinguished as a unique taxon due to its distinct phenotypic and genomic characteristics.\n\nThe ecological role and potential clinical significance of Alistipes timonensis JC136 within the human gut microbiome are still under investigation, as further research is needed to understand its interactions and potential contributions to human health or disease.",
