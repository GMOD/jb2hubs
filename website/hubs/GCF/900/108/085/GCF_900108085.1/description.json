  "description": "Algoriphagus boritolerans DSM 17298 = JCM 18970 is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Algoriphagus, within the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Japan.\n\nAlgoriphagus boritolerans is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It exhibits a rod-shaped morphology and is typically 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-3.0 μm long.\n\nThe species is able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C. It is capable of tolerating moderate levels of salt (up to 4% NaCl) and can grow at a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, with an optimal pH around 7.0.\n\nAlgoriphagus boritolerans is known to be able to degrade various polysaccharides, such as agar, alginate, and cellulose, and can utilize a variety of carbon sources for energy and growth. It has been reported to possess the ability to produce carotenoid pigments, which may contribute to its yellowish-orange colony appearance.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Algoriphagus boritolerans is closely related to other species within the genus Algoriphagus, which are typically found in a range of aquatic and soil environments.",
