  "description": "Bacteroides ndongoniae is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. This species was first isolated from the human gut microbiome and was named after the Ndongo region in Angola, where the initial sample was collected.\n\nBacteroides ndongoniae is a non-spore-forming, non-motile, and rod-shaped bacterium. It is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, and xylose, to produce acetic and propionic acids as the main end products of its metabolism.\n\nThis species is commonly found as a part of the normal gut microbiota in humans and is considered an important member of the anaerobic community within the human intestinal tract. Bacteroides ndongoniae plays a role in the breakdown and utilization of complex polysaccharides, contributing to the overall metabolic functions of the gut microbiome.\n\nDue to its anaerobic nature and ability to thrive in the human gut environment, Bacteroides ndongoniae has been the subject of research investigating its potential roles in human health and disease, particularly in the context of gut microbial dysbiosis and associated conditions.",
