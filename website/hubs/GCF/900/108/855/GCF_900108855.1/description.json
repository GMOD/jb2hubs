  "description": "Dyadobacter koreensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in South Korea. It belongs to the genus Dyadobacter, which is a part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThe cells of Dyadobacter koreensis are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and exhibit gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C, and it can grow in the presence of up to 2% sodium chloride.\n\nDyadobacter koreensis is capable of hydrolyzing various polymers, such as starch, casein, and gelatin, indicating its ability to degrade complex organic compounds. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dyadobacter koreensis is closely related to other Dyadobacter species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and biochemical characteristics.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of Dyadobacter koreensis provide insights into the diversity of soil bacteria and their potential roles in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning.",
