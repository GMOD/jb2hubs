  "description": "Cribrihabitans marinus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cribrihabitans marinus is typically found in marine environments, such as seawater and sediments.\n\nThe cells of Cribrihabitans marinus are rod-shaped and exhibit a cribrate (sieve-like) surface structure, which is a distinguishing feature of this species. This unique surface structure is thought to be involved in nutrient uptake and attachment to surfaces.\n\nCribrihabitans marinus is chemoheterotrophic, meaning it requires organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy for growth. It is capable of utilizing a variety of complex organic compounds, including polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids, which are commonly found in marine environments.\n\nThis bacterium is believed to play a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in marine ecosystems, contributing to the overall functioning and dynamics of these environments.",
