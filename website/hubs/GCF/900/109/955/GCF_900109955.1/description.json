  "description": "Aliiroseovarius sediminilitoris is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Alphaproteobacteria. It was first isolated from sediment samples collected from the coastal area of the Yellow Sea in China.\n\nThe cells of Aliiroseovarius sediminilitoris are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped. They typically measure around 0.5-0.8 µm in width and 1.2-2.0 µm in length. The cells are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum.\n\nAliiroseovarius sediminilitoris is an aerobic, chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and obtains its energy from the oxidation of organic compounds. The bacterium is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 28°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aliiroseovarius sediminilitoris is closely related to other members of the genus Aliiroseovarius, which are typically found in marine and coastal environments. The species name \"sediminilitoris\" refers to the fact that it was isolated from sediment samples collected from the coastal area.\n\nOverall, Aliiroseovarius sediminilitoris represents a relatively newly described species of bacteria with potential ecological roles in coastal sediment environments.",
