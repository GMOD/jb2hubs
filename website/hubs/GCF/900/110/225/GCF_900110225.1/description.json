  "description": "Brachymonas denitrificans DSM 15123 is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Betaproteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, motile bacterium that is capable of denitrification, a process in which nitrate or nitrite is reduced to gaseous nitrogen compounds, such as nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, or dinitrogen.\n\nThis species was first isolated from a denitrifying fixed-bed reactor used for the treatment of industrial wastewater. It is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. Brachymonas denitrificans DSM 15123 is able to utilize a variety of carbon sources, including acetate, glucose, and sucrose, for growth and denitrification.\n\nThe cells of this species are typically short, rod-shaped, and approximately 1-2 micrometers in length. They are capable of motility through the use of flagella. Brachymonas denitrificans DSM 15123 is considered an aerobic denitrifier, as it can perform denitrification in the presence of oxygen.\n\nThis bacterium has been studied for its potential applications in wastewater treatment and bioremediation, particularly in the removal of nitrate and nitrite from contaminated environments.",
