  "description": "Actinokineospora terrae is a species of actinobacteria that was isolated from soil samples. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. The cells of A. terrae are typically rod-shaped and exhibit a motile, gliding movement. \n\nThe optimal growth conditions for A. terrae include a temperature range of 25-30Â°C and a neutral pH around 7.0. The bacterium can utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources for growth, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has placed A. terrae within the genus Actinokineospora, which is a member of the family Pseudonocardiaceae. The genus Actinokineospora is characterized by the production of branched, septate hyphae and the ability to form motile spores.\n\nA. terrae has been reported to produce secondary metabolites with potential bioactive properties, making it an interesting subject for further exploration in the field of natural product discovery and biotechnology applications.",
