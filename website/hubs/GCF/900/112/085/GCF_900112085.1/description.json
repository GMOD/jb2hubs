  "description": "Acetitomaculum ruminis DSM 5522 is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from the rumen of a cow. It is a member of the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia.\n\nThe cells of A. ruminis DSM 5522 are rod-shaped and motile, with peritrichous flagella. They are capable of forming endospores, which allows the bacteria to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nAcetitomaculum ruminis DSM 5522 is a chemoorganotrophic bacterium, meaning it obtains its energy and carbon from organic compounds. It is capable of fermenting a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and cellobiose, and producing acetate as the primary fermentation end-product.\n\nThis species is found naturally in the rumen, the first compartment of the digestive system of ruminant animals, where it plays a role in the breakdown and fermentation of plant material. It is considered an important member of the rumen microbiome, contributing to the overall digestive processes of the host animal.\n\nThe genome of Acetitomaculum ruminis DSM 5522 has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential roles in the rumen ecosystem.",
