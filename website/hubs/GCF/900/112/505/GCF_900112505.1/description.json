  "description": "Devosia psychrophila is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Devosia. It is a psychrophilic (cold-loving) microorganism, which means it thrives in cold environments, typically at temperatures below 20°C (68°F).\n\nDevosia psychrophila is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to move using flagella. The cells of D. psychrophila are typically 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.2-2.0 μm long.\n\nThis species was first isolated from a soil sample collected from the Antarctic region, indicating its adaptation to cold, polar environments. Devosia psychrophila is known to have the ability to grow at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 25°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 15°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, Devosia psychrophila is closely related to other Devosia species and is classified within the family Devosiaceae, which is part of the phylum Proteobacteria. The genome sequence of D. psychrophila has been determined, providing insights into its genetic and metabolic characteristics that enable its survival and adaptation to cold habitats.\n\nDue to its unique cold-adapted properties, Devosia psychrophila has potential applications in various fields, such as bioremediation, biotechnology, and the development of cold-active enzymes and other biomolecules.",
