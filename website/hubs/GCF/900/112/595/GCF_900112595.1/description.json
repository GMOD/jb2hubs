  "description": "Algibacter pectinivorans is a species of bacterium that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from the surface of a red macroalga (seaweed) collected from the East Sea, off the coast of South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Algibacter pectinivorans are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and motile, with gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this bacterium is around 25-30Â°C.\n\nAlgibacter pectinivorans is known to be capable of degrading pectin, a complex polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many plants, including macroalgae. This ability to utilize pectin as a carbon and energy source is reflected in the species name \"pectinivorans,\" which means \"pectin-consuming.\"\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Algibacter pectinivorans is most closely related to other species within the genus Algibacter, which are also known to be associated with marine macroalgae.\n\nThe ecological role of Algibacter pectinivorans in the marine environment is likely related to its ability to break down and utilize complex polysaccharides, such as pectin, thereby contributing to the recycling of organic matter in the algal-associated microbial communities.",
