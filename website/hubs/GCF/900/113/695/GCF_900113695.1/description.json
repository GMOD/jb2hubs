  "description": "Albimonas pacifica is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Albimonas pacifica is known to be found in marine environments, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe cells of Albimonas pacifica are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. They are motile, with the help of polar flagella. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are usually white or off-white in color.\n\nPhylogenetically, Albimonas pacifica is closely related to other members of the genus Albimonas, which are known to be capable of oxidizing various organic compounds as their energy sources. The specific metabolic capabilities and ecological roles of Albimonas pacifica in marine ecosystems are still under investigation by microbiologists and environmental scientists.",
