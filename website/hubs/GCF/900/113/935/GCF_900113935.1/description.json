  "description": "Aquamicrobium aerolatum DSM 21857 is a species of bacteria that was isolated from air samples collected in Germany. It belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria, class Alphaproteobacteria, and order Rhizobiales.\n\nThe cells of Aquamicrobium aerolatum DSM 21857 are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are circular, convex, and cream-colored.\n\nAquamicrobium aerolatum DSM 21857 is chemoheterotrophic, meaning it requires organic compounds as a carbon and energy source. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The species is also able to tolerate a wide range of pH values, with a growth pH range of 6.0 to 9.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aquamicrobium aerolatum DSM 21857 is most closely related to other bacteria within the genus Aquamicrobium, which are typically found in aquatic and soil environments.\n\nThis species has been studied for its potential role in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and its possible applications in bioremediation or other biotechnological processes, though its specific ecological functions and metabolic capabilities are still under investigation.",
