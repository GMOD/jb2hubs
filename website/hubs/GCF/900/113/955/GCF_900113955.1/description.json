  "description": "Celeribacter neptunius is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from seawater collected near the Neptune oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nCeleribacter neptunius is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can tolerate a wide range of salinities, from 1% to 10% NaCl.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Celeribacter neptunius is closely related to other members of the genus Celeribacter, which are known to be commonly found in marine environments. The species name \"neptunius\" refers to its isolation from the vicinity of the Neptune oil field.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological and metabolic capabilities of Celeribacter neptunius may provide insights into its potential roles in the marine ecosystem, such as its involvement in the cycling of organic matter or adaptation to hydrocarbon-rich environments.",
