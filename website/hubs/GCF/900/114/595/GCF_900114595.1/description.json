  "description": "Desulfomicrobium norvegicum is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was first isolated from marine sediments collected near the coast of Norway. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium that belongs to the Desulfomicrobium genus within the Desulfovibrionaceae family.\n\nThe cells of Desulfomicrobium norvegicum are typically oval-shaped or rod-shaped, measuring approximately 1.0-2.5 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are obligately anaerobic, meaning they can only grow in the absence of oxygen, and they obtain their energy by coupling the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen with the reduction of sulfate to sulfide.\n\nThis species is capable of utilizing a variety of organic substrates, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as electron donors for sulfate reduction. It can also grow autotrophically, using hydrogen as the electron donor and carbon dioxide as the carbon source.\n\nDesulfomicrobium norvegicum is considered an important member of the microbial community in marine sediments, where it plays a crucial role in the sulfur cycle by converting sulfate to sulfide, which can then be used by other organisms or participate in various biogeochemical processes.",
