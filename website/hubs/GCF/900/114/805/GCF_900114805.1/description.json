  "description": "Agrococcus baldri is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Agrococcus. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile coccus-shaped bacterium. Agrococcus baldri was first isolated from soil samples collected from the Baldr Mountains in Norway.\n\nThe cells of Agrococcus baldri are typically spherical, with a diameter ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 μm. They are arranged in pairs or irregular clusters. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are typically small, circular, and smooth in appearance.\n\nAgrococcus baldri is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 30°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 25°C. The bacterium is also able to tolerate a wide range of pH levels, from 5.5 to 9.0, with an optimal pH around 7.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Agrococcus baldri is closely related to other members of the genus Agrococcus, which are known to be found in various environmental samples, such as soil, plant materials, and water.\n\nThe ecological role and potential applications of Agrococcus baldri in the environment or biotechnology are not yet well-understood and require further investigation.",
