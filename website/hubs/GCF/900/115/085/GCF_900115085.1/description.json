  "description": "Dokdonella immobilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria and the family Cytophagaceae. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nDokdonella immobilis was first isolated from soil samples collected in Dokdo, an island located in the East Sea, South Korea. The cells of this species are typically rod-shaped and range in size from 0.4 to 0.6 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 1.5 micrometers in length.\n\nThis bacterium is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 15°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 28°C. It can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids as carbon and energy sources.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Dokdonella immobilis is closely related to other members of the genus Dokdonella, which are known to be involved in the degradation of complex organic compounds in soil and aquatic environments.\n\nOverall, Dokdonella immobilis is a non-pathogenic, soil-dwelling bacterium that plays a role in the cycling of organic matter in its natural habitat.",
