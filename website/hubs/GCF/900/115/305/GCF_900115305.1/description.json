  "description": "Algoriphagus ornithinivorans is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from the feces of a wild goose in South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Algoriphagus ornithinivorans are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and motile, with gliding motility. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30Â°C.\n\nTaxonomically, Algoriphagus ornithinivorans is classified within the genus Algoriphagus, which is known to contain bacteria capable of degrading complex carbohydrates. This specific species was named for its ability to utilize ornithine, an amino acid found in the feces of birds, as a carbon and energy source.\n\nGenome analysis has revealed that Algoriphagus ornithinivorans possesses genes involved in the degradation of various polysaccharides, suggesting it may play a role in the recycling of organic matter in the gut environments of birds. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecological significance and potential applications of this bacterial species.",
