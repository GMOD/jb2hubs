  "description": "Arcanobacterium urinimassiliense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human urine sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the Arcanobacterium genus, which are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacteria.\n\nThe cells of A. urinimassiliense are coccoid to short-rod shaped, and they typically measure around 0.5-1.0 μm in diameter and 1.0-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that A. urinimassiliense is most closely related to other Arcanobacterium species, such as A. haemolyticum and A. hippocoleae. However, it can be distinguished from these related species based on its unique biochemical and genomic characteristics.\n\nA. urinimassiliense is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been isolated from human clinical samples, including urine, blood, and wound infections. Further research is needed to fully understand its potential role in human health and disease.",
