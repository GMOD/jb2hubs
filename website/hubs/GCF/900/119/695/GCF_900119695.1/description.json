  "description": "Actinomyces urinae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Actinomyces. It is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium.\n\nActinomyces urinae is primarily found in the human urinary tract, particularly in the bladder and urethra. It is considered an opportunistic pathogen and can cause infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), in individuals with underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems.\n\nThe bacterium is known to form characteristic branching filaments, a feature common among Actinomyces species. It can produce colonies with a dry, granular, or chalky appearance when cultured in the laboratory.\n\nActinomyces urinae is typically sensitive to a range of antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and certain macrolides. Accurate identification of this species is essential for appropriate antimicrobial treatment and management of infections caused by Actinomyces urinae.",
