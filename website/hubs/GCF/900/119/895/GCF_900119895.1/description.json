  "description": "Collinsella phocaeensis is a species of bacterium that belongs to the genus Collinsella, which is part of the Actinobacteria phylum. This species was first isolated from human fecal samples collected in Marseille, France.\n\nCollinsella phocaeensis is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and anaerobic bacterium. It has a coccoid or rod-shaped cellular morphology. Biochemically, this species is able to ferment various carbohydrates and produce acetic acid as the main end-product of its metabolism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Collinsella phocaeensis is closely related to other Collinsella species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique genomic and phenotypic characteristics. The species name \"phocaeensis\" refers to the geographic location (Phocaea, the ancient name for Marseille) where the type strain was first isolated.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological role and potential clinical or biotechnological relevance of Collinsella phocaeensis within the human gut microbiome.",
