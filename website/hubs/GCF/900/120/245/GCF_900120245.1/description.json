  "description": "Actinomyces pacaensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Actinomyces. It was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of the paca, a large rodent found in South America.\n\nActinomyces pacaensis is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It forms branching, filamentous colonies and is characterized by its ability to degrade complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, which are common in the diet of the paca.\n\nThe genome of Actinomyces pacaensis has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential role in the paca's digestive system. Further research is ongoing to understand the ecology and interactions of this species within the gut microbiome of its host.",
