  "description": "Bacteroides mediterraneensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that was first isolated from the Mediterranean Sea. It belongs to the genus Bacteroides, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nSome key characteristics of Bacteroides mediterraneensis:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and non-motile.\n\n2. Habitat: It is typically found in marine and coastal environments, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n3. Physiology: Bacteroides mediterraneensis is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is also saccharolytic, able to break down and utilize carbohydrates as a source of energy.\n\n4. Genomics: Analysis of the genome sequence has revealed insights into the metabolic capabilities and adaptations of this species to its marine environment.\n\n5. Ecological role: As a member of the gut microbiome of marine organisms, Bacteroides mediterraneensis likely plays a role in the breakdown and recycling of complex organic matter in the marine ecosystem.\n\nOverall, Bacteroides mediterraneensis is a relatively recently discovered species that provides insights into the diversity and functional roles of anaerobic bacteria in marine environments.",
