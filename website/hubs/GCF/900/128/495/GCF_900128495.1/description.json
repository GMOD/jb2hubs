  "description": "Bacteroides ilei is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. It is commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the ileum, which is the final section of the small intestine.\n\nBacteroides ilei is a non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that is typically 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. It is considered a member of the normal gut microbiota and plays a role in the breakdown and fermentation of complex carbohydrates, contributing to the overall metabolic processes within the human intestine.\n\nThe species is known to be involved in the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can have beneficial effects on host health, such as providing energy sources for intestinal epithelial cells and modulating immune responses. Additionally, Bacteroides ilei has been studied for its potential roles in maintaining gut homeostasis and influencing the overall composition of the gut microbiome.\n\nResearch on Bacteroides ilei is ongoing, as scientists continue to explore its interactions with other gut microbiota members and its potential implications for human health and disease.",
