  "description": "Bacteroides luti is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Bacteroides. This species was isolated from the muddy sediment of a freshwater lake.\n\nBacteroides luti is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen. It is a chemoorganotroph, obtaining its energy and carbon sources from organic compounds. The cells of B. luti are typically 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-1.2 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetically, Bacteroides luti is closely related to other members of the Bacteroides genus, which are commonly found in the human gut microbiome and play important roles in nutrient metabolism and immune system regulation. However, B. luti is specifically adapted to the freshwater lake environment where it was initially isolated.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles and potential applications of Bacteroides luti in various biotechnological or environmental contexts.",
