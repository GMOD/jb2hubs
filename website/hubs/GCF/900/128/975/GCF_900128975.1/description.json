  "description": "Devosia limi DSM 17137 is a species of bacteria that was isolated from a sample of sediment collected from a freshwater lake. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cells of Devosia limi DSM 17137 are typically rod-shaped and motile, with a single polar flagellum.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 25-30Â°C and a pH range of 6.5-8.0. Devosia limi DSM 17137 is able to use a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nPhylogenetically, Devosia limi DSM 17137 belongs to the genus Devosia, which is a member of the family Devosiaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria. The species was first described in 2007 based on the analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence and other phenotypic characteristics.\n\nOverall, Devosia limi DSM 17137 is a freshwater-dwelling bacterium with the ability to degrade a range of organic compounds, which may contribute to its role in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic environments.",
