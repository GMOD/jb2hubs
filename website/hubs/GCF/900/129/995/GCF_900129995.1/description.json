  "description": "Caloranaerobacter azorensis DSM 13643 is an anaerobic, thermophilic, spore-forming bacterium that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent system located in the Azores, an autonomous region of Portugal. The species name \"azorensis\" refers to the Azores, the location where the microorganism was first discovered.\n\nThis bacterium is a member of the Firmicutes phylum and the Clostridia class. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 75°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 65°C. Caloranaerobacter azorensis is a heterotrophic microorganism, meaning it requires organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy for growth.\n\nThe cells of C. azorensis are rod-shaped and possess a Gram-positive cell wall structure. They are capable of forming endospores, which are dormant, resistant structures that allow the bacteria to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions.\n\nCaloranaeobacter azorensis is of scientific interest due to its adaptation to the high-temperature, deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment, where it likely plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients. Its thermophilic nature and metabolic capabilities may also have potential applications in biotechnology, such as the production of biofuels or the degradation of complex organic compounds.",
