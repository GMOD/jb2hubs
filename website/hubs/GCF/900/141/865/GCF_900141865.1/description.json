  "description": "Anaerovibrio lipolyticus DSM 3074 is an anaerobic, lipolytic bacterium that was first isolated from the rumen of a sheep. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile species with a vibrioid or curved rod-shaped morphology.\n\nSome key characteristics of Anaerovibrio lipolyticus DSM 3074 include:\n\n1. Metabolism: It is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is also a chemoorganotroph, obtaining energy and carbon from organic compounds.\n\n2. Lipolytic activity: As the name suggests, this species is capable of hydrolyzing lipids (fats and oils) through the production of lipase enzymes. This ability makes it an important player in the breakdown of lipids in the rumen environment.\n\n3. Substrate utilization: Anaerovibrio lipolyticus can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and lactose, as well as some organic acids like acetate and propionate, for growth.\n\n4. Habitat and ecology: This bacterium is commonly found in the rumen of ruminant animals, where it plays a role in the digestion and metabolism of lipids as part of the complex microbial community.\n\n5. Taxonomy and phylogeny: Anaerovibrio lipolyticus belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the class Bacteroidia. It is the type species of the genus Anaerovibrio.\n\nOverall, Anaerovibrio lipolyticus DSM 3074 is an anaerobic, lipolytic bacterium that is adapted to the rumen environment and plays a important role in the breakdown and utilization of lipids in ruminant animals.",
