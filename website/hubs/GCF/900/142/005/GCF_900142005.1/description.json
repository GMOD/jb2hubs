  "description": "Dethiosulfatibacter aminovorans DSM 17477 is a species of anaerobic, mesophilic, and chemoheterotrophic bacteria. It was first isolated from an anaerobic digester treating food waste.\n\nSome key features of this species:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are straight to slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.5-3.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Metabolism: D. aminovorans is capable of dissimilatory sulfate reduction, using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor and oxidizing various organic compounds as electron donors.\n\n3. Optimal growth conditions: The bacterium grows optimally at 37°C and pH 7.0-7.5. It can tolerate salt concentrations up to 2% (w/v) NaCl.\n\n4. Phylogeny: D. aminovorans belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Syntrophobacteraceae.\n\n5. Ecological role: As a sulfate-reducing bacterium, D. aminovorans plays a role in the sulfur cycle, particularly in anaerobic environments rich in organic matter and sulfate, such as anaerobic digesters.\n\n6. Significance: This species has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and biohydrogen production due to its ability to utilize a variety of organic substrates and reduce sulfate.",
