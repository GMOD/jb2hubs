  "description": "Anaerocolumna jejuensis DSM 15929 is a species of anaerobic bacterium that was isolated from a tidal flat sediment sample collected in Jeju Island, South Korea. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that measures approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nAnaerocolumna jejuensis is strictly anaerobic, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is chemoorganotrophic, deriving its energy from the oxidation of organic compounds. The bacterium is mesophilic, with an optimal growth temperature range of 30-37°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, Anaerocolumna jejuensis belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, and order Clostridiales. It is characterized by its ability to ferment various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and xylose, producing acetate, lactate, and hydrogen as the main fermentation products.\n\nThe type strain of Anaerocolumna jejuensis, DSM 15929, was deposited in the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) culture collection, and its complete genome sequence has been determined, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and adaptations to the anaerobic tidal flat environment.",
