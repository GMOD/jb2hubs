  "description": "Anaerobranca californiensis DSM 14826 is a species of anaerobic, spore-forming, thermophilic bacteria that was isolated from a hot spring located in California, United States. Some key scientific characteristics of this species are as follows:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are straight to slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 2.0-6.0 μm long. They form endospores.\n\n2. Growth Conditions: Anaerobranca californiensis is a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium, growing optimally at temperatures between 55-65°C and pH 6.0-7.5. It is able to grow in the presence of up to 2% (w/v) NaCl.\n\n3. Metabolism: This species is a chemoorganotroph, able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, sucrose, and xylose, as carbon and energy sources. It can also degrade cellulose and xylan. The main fermentation products are acetate, lactate, and hydrogen.\n\n4. Phylogeny and Taxonomy: Anaerobranca californiensis belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia, order Clostridiales, and family Syntrophomonadaceae. It is closely related to other Anaerobranca species, such as Anaerobranca gottschalkii.\n\n5. Ecological Significance: As a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium, Anaerobranca californiensis likely plays a role in the cycling of organic matter and nutrients in hot spring environments. Its ability to degrade complex carbohydrates may be of interest for biotechnological applications, such as the production of biofuels or other valuable compounds.",
