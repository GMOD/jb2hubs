  "description": "Duganella sacchari is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Duganella, which is part of the Betaproteobacteria class within the Proteobacteria phylum. This species was first isolated from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) leaf sheaths in Brazil.\n\nDuganella sacchari is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is motile, with peritrichous flagella, and forms round, smooth, and off-white colonies on agar plates. Cells are typically rod-shaped, measuring approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Duganella sacchari is closely related to other Duganella species, such as Duganella violaceinigra and Duganella zoogloeoides. This species is able to grow at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 35°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C.\n\nDuganella sacchari is known to possess the ability to produce the pigment violacein, which gives the colonies a distinctive purple-violet color. This pigment has been studied for its potential antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. The ecological role and potential applications of Duganella sacchari in biotechnology or agriculture are still under investigation.",
