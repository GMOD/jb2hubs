  "description": "Carnobacterium alterfunditum is a species of Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacterium that belongs to the genus Carnobacterium. This species was first isolated from the sediment of a freshwater lake in Finland.\n\nThe cells of Carnobacterium alterfunditum are typically rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. They can occur singly, in pairs, or in short chains. This bacterium is capable of growing at a wide range of temperatures, from 4°C to 30°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 20-25°C.\n\nCarnobacterium alterfunditum is considered a psychrotolerant (cold-tolerant) species, as it can grow and thrive in cold environments. It is also capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and lactose, and producing lactic acid as the primary end-product of its metabolism.\n\nThis species has been found to be ecologically relevant in freshwater environments, where it may play a role in nutrient cycling and organic matter decomposition. Additionally, Carnobacterium alterfunditum has been studied for its potential use in biotechnological applications, such as in the production of fermented foods or as a biocontrol agent against certain pathogens.",
