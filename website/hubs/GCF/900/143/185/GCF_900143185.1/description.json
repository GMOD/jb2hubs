  "description": "Chryseobacterium scophthalmum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium.\n\nThe cells of C. scophthalmum are yellow-pigmented, rod-shaped, and motile. They typically measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length.\n\nThis species was initially isolated from the gills of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), a commercially important flatfish species. It is known to be found in aquatic environments, particularly in association with fish and other marine organisms.\n\nC. scophthalmum is able to grow at a wide range of temperatures, from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 25-30°C. It is also tolerant to various salt concentrations, making it well-adapted to marine and estuarine habitats.\n\nTaxonomically, C. scophthalmum is classified within the family Flavobacteriaceae, which is a group of bacteria known for their diverse metabolic capabilities and roles in various environmental processes.\n\nFurther research on the ecology, physiology, and potential applications of C. scophthalmum may provide insights into its significance in aquatic ecosystems and its potential use in biotechnological or environmental applications.",
