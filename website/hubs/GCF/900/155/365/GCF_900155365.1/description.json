  "description": "Collinsella bouchesdurhonensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Collinsella, within the phylum Actinobacteria. It was first isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of humans living in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne region of France.\n\nCollinsella bouchesdurhonensis is a gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is characterized by its coccoid or rod-shaped cellular morphology and its ability to ferment various carbohydrates, producing lactic acid as a major end-product.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Collinsella bouchesdurhonensis is closely related to other Collinsella species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique genomic and biochemical characteristics.\n\nThis species is believed to be a common member of the human gut microbiome and may play a role in the maintenance of a healthy intestinal ecosystem. However, its specific functions and interactions within the complex gut microbial community are still under investigation.",
