  "description": "Corynebacterium urinipleomorphum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is a Gram-positive, pleomorphic (variable in shape), non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nThe cells of Corynebacterium urinipleomorphum can appear as coryneform (club-shaped), rod-shaped, or even irregular in morphology, depending on the growth conditions and stage of the bacterial life cycle. They typically measure between 0.5 to 1.0 micrometers in width and 1.0 to 3.0 micrometers in length.\n\nThis species is classified as a member of the Corynebacterium genus due to its characteristic cell wall structure and the presence of mycolic acids, which are long-chain fatty acids commonly found in the cell walls of Corynebacterium species.\n\nCorynebacterium urinipleomorphum is known to be isolated from human urine samples, which is the basis for its species name. However, its precise ecological niche and potential clinical significance are still under investigation.",
