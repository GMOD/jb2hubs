  "description": "Aromatoleum tolulyticum is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Aromatoleum, which is a member of the family Rhodocyclaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria. This bacterium is known for its ability to degrade toluene, a monoaromatic hydrocarbon compound, as its primary carbon and energy source.\n\nAromatoleum tolulyticum is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and motile bacterium. It is typically rod-shaped and capable of growing under both mesophilic and psychrophilic (cold-loving) conditions. The bacterium has been isolated from various environmental sources, including soil and groundwater, where it plays a role in the biodegradation of toluene and other aromatic compounds.\n\nThe metabolic capabilities of Aromatoleum tolulyticum, particularly its ability to utilize toluene as a substrate, make it a potential candidate for bioremediation applications, where it can be used to remove or degrade toluene and other aromatic pollutants from contaminated environments.",
