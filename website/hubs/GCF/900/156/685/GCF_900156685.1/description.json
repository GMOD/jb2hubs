  "description": "Chryseobacterium piscicola is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from the gills of a freshwater fish, the crucian carp (Carassius carassius), in China. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium within the family Flavobacteriaceae.\n\nChryseobacterium piscicola is characterized by its yellowish-orange pigmentation, which is due to the production of carotenoid pigments. It is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Chryseobacterium piscicola is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and biochemical characteristics.\n\nThis bacterium has been primarily isolated from aquatic environments, particularly from the gills and skin of various freshwater fish species. Its potential ecological role and interactions with the host fish are not yet fully understood, but it may play a role in the microbial community of fish habitats.",
