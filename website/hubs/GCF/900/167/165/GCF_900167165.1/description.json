  "description": "Carboxydocella sporoproducens DSM 16521 is a species of anaerobic, thermophilic bacteria that was isolated from a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, USA. It is capable of growth on carbon monoxide (CO) as the sole energy source, utilizing the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase to oxidize CO to carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\nThis bacterium is a spore-forming, rod-shaped organism that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It can grow at temperatures ranging from 45°C to 65°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 55°C. Carboxydocella sporoproducens is capable of heterotrophic growth, utilizing a variety of organic compounds, and can also fix atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has placed Carboxydocella sporoproducens within the family Clostridiaceae. It is considered a member of the group of \"carboxydotrophic\" bacteria, which are able to use CO as their sole or primary carbon and energy source.\n\nThe ability of this species to thrive in high-temperature, CO-rich environments makes it of interest for potential applications in bioremediation and bioenergy production from waste gas streams containing CO.",
