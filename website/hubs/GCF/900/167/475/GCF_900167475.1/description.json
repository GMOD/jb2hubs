  "description": "Aeromicrobium choanae is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from the nasal cavity of a human patient. The genus Aeromicrobium belongs to the family Nocardioidaceae and is characterized by the ability to form aerial hyphae and spores.\n\nAeromicrobium choanae cells are Gram-positive, non-motile, and have a coccoid or short rod-shaped morphology. They are obligate aerobes, meaning they require oxygen for growth. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30-37Â°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Aeromicrobium choanae is closely related to other Aeromicrobium species, but it can be distinguished from them by its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics.\n\nThe isolation of this species from the human nasal cavity suggests that it may be a natural inhabitant of the human microbiome, but its precise ecological roles and potential interactions with the host are still under investigation.",
