  "description": "Daejeonella lutea is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum. It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and spore-forming bacterium. Daejeonella lutea was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Daejeon, South Korea.\n\nThe cells of Daejeonella lutea are rod-shaped and typically measure around 0.5-0.7 µm in width and 1.0-2.5 µm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are yellow in color, which is the basis for its species name \"lutea\" meaning \"yellow\" in Latin.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Daejeonella lutea is most closely related to other bacterial genera within the Firmicutes phylum, such as Bacillus and Paenibacillus. However, it forms a distinct clade, indicating that it represents a unique lineage within this bacterial group.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Daejeonella lutea include a temperature range of 25-37°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0. This bacterium is capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources and can reduce nitrate to nitrite, among other metabolic capabilities.\n\nFurther research is needed to elucidate the specific ecological roles and potential applications of Daejeonella lutea in natural environments or industrial processes.",
