  "description": "Andreprevotia lacus DSM 23236 is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a freshwater lake. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, which is a group of Gram-negative bacteria known for their versatile metabolic capabilities and important roles in various ecosystems.\n\nAndreprevotia lacus is an aerobic, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped bacterium. It is chemoheterotrophic, meaning it can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 25-30Â°C, and it can tolerate a relatively wide range of pH values, typically between 6.0 and 8.0.\n\nGenomic analysis of Andreprevotia lacus DSM 23236 has revealed insights into its metabolic potential and ecological adaptations. The genome encodes genes involved in the degradation of complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, suggesting its ability to play a role in the recycling of organic matter in freshwater environments.\n\nFurther research on the ecology, physiology, and potential applications of Andreprevotia lacus DSM 23236 may contribute to our understanding of the functional diversity and importance of Bacteroidetes bacteria in aquatic ecosystems.",
