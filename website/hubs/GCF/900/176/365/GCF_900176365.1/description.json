  "description": "Desulfocicer vacuolatum DSM 3385 is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was first isolated from a freshwater lake in Germany. It is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium that belongs to the Deltaproteobacteria class.\n\nSome key features of Desulfocicer vacuolatum DSM 3385:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a rod-shaped bacterium that can form large vacuoles within its cells, which is a distinguishing characteristic of the species.\n\n2. Metabolism: As a sulfate-reducing bacterium, it can use sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration, reducing it to sulfide.\n\n3. Growth requirements: It is capable of growth on a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and ethanol, as carbon and energy sources.\n\n4. Habitat: This species has been found in freshwater environments, including lakes and sediments, where it plays a role in the sulfur cycle.\n\n5. Significance: Desulfocicer vacuolatum and other sulfate-reducing bacteria are important in biogeochemical cycling, as they can influence the mobility and availability of metals in aquatic environments through their metabolic activities.\n\nOverall, Desulfocicer vacuolatum DSM 3385 is a unique, anaerobic, sulfate-reducing bacterium that has been characterized for its distinctive cellular morphology and ecological role in freshwater ecosystems.",
