  "description": "Collinsella vaginalis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium that belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria. It is a commensal member of the human vaginal microbiome and is commonly found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.\n\nCollinsella vaginalis is a fastidious microorganism, meaning it has specific growth requirements and can be challenging to culture in the laboratory. It is an obligate anaerobe, requiring an oxygen-free environment for growth and metabolism.\n\nThe presence of Collinsella vaginalis in the vaginal microbiome is considered a marker of a balanced and healthy vaginal ecosystem. It is believed to play a role in maintaining the natural acidic pH of the vagina, which helps to prevent the overgrowth of potentially pathogenic microorganisms.\n\nWhile the exact functions of Collinsella vaginalis within the vaginal environment are still being investigated, studies have suggested that it may contribute to the production of antimicrobial compounds and the competitive exclusion of harmful bacteria, thereby contributing to the overall vaginal health and homeostasis.",
