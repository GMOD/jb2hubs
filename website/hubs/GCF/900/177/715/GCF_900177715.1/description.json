  "description": "Altererythrobacter xiamenensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from sediment samples collected from Xiamen, China. It belongs to the genus Altererythrobacter, which is classified within the phylum Proteobacteria, class Alphaproteobacteria, and order Sphingomonadales.\n\nAltererythrobacter xiamenensis is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to produce carotenoid pigments, which give the colonies a reddish-orange color.\n\nPhysiologically, Altererythrobacter xiamenensis is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The bacterium can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Altererythrobacter xiamenensis is closely related to other species within the genus Altererythrobacter, which are known to be found in various aquatic and soil environments.\n\nThe isolation and identification of Altererythrobacter xiamenensis contribute to our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of bacteria in coastal sediment environments.",
