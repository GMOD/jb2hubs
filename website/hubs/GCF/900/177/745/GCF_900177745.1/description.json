  "description": "Corynebacterium pollutisoli is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Corynebacterium. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nCorynebacterium pollutisoli was first isolated from soil samples contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. It is known to be able to degrade and utilize various hydrocarbon compounds as a carbon and energy source, making it a potential candidate for bioremediation applications in oil-contaminated environments.\n\nThe cells of Corynebacterium pollutisoli are typically between 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-3.0 μm in length. They exhibit a characteristic club-shaped or \"snapping\" cell division pattern, which is a common feature of the genus Corynebacterium.\n\nPhylogenetically, Corynebacterium pollutisoli is closely related to other Corynebacterium species, and its genome has been partially sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential applications in environmental biotechnology.",
