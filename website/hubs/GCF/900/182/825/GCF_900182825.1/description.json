  "description": "Chryseobacterium profundimaris is a species of bacteria that was isolated from deep-sea sediment samples collected from the East China Sea. It belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is a group of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and yellow-pigmented bacteria commonly found in various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and clinical samples.\n\nThe key characteristics of Chryseobacterium profundimaris are as follows:\n\n1. Cell morphology: The cells are rod-shaped, non-motile, and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 µm in width and 0.8-2.0 µm in length.\n\n2. Pigmentation: The colonies appear yellow in color due to the production of carotenoid pigments.\n\n3. Temperature and pH range: The bacterium is psychrotolerant, capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of 25-30°C. It can tolerate a wide pH range, from 6.0 to 8.5, with an optimal pH of 7.0-7.5.\n\n4. Oxygen requirements: Chryseobacterium profundimaris is an aerobic bacterium, requiring oxygen for growth.\n\n5. Biochemical characteristics: The bacterium is positive for catalase and oxidase activities, and can hydrolyze Tween 80, gelatin, and casein. It is able to utilize a variety of carbohydrates as carbon sources.\n\n6. Habitat and ecology: Chryseobacterium profundimaris was isolated from deep-sea sediment samples collected at a depth of approximately 3,000 meters in the East China Sea, indicating its adaptation to the high-pressure, low-temperature, and nutrient-limited conditions of the deep-sea environment.\n\nThis species has been characterized and described in the scientific literature, contributing to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of Chryseobacterium bacteria in deep-sea ecosystems.",
