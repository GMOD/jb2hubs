  "description": "Desulfurobacterium pacificum is a species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that was isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent located in the Pacific Ocean. This microorganism is capable of obtaining its energy through the oxidation of hydrogen and the reduction of sulfur compounds, a process known as chemolithoautotrophy.\n\nThe cells of Desulfurobacterium pacificum are described as being rod-shaped, non-spore-forming, and motile. They are capable of growing at high temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature range between 55°C and 65°C, and can tolerate a wide range of pH levels, from 5.5 to 8.0.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfurobacterium pacificum belongs to the Aquificae phylum, which is composed of thermophilic and chemolithoautotrophic bacteria often found in geothermal environments. This species is known to play a role in the sulfur and hydrogen cycles within deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, contributing to the cycling of these important elements in these unique and extreme environments.",
