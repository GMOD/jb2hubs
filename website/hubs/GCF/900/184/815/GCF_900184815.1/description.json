  "description": "Boseongicola aestuarii is a species of bacteria that was isolated from the sediment of an estuary located in Boseong-gun, South Korea. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the class Flavobacteriia.\n\nThe cells of Boseongicola aestuarii are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-1.5 μm in length. The colonies formed by this species on agar plates are yellow-pigmented, circular, and convex.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Boseongicola aestuarii is most closely related to other bacteria within the genus Flavobacterium. This genus is known to contain species that are commonly found in aquatic environments, including freshwater and marine habitats.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Boseongicola aestuarii include a temperature range of 25-30°C and a pH range of 6.5-8.0. This species is able to hydrolyze a variety of macromolecules, such as starch, casein, and Tween 80, which suggests it may play a role in the decomposition of organic matter in estuarine ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Boseongicola aestuarii represents a novel bacterial species that has been isolated from the sediments of a Korean estuary and is characterized by its distinct morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic properties.",
