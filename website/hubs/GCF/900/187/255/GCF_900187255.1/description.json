  "description": "Capnocytophaga haemolytica is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic bacteria. It is a member of the genus Capnocytophaga, which are part of the normal oral microbiota in humans and animals.\n\nThe key features of Capnocytophaga haemolytica are:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a slender, rod-shaped bacterium, typically 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 3-8 μm in length.\n\n2. Habitat: C. haemolytica is found primarily in the oral cavity and respiratory tract of humans and various animal species, including dogs, cats, and non-human primates.\n\n3. Growth requirements: It is a fastidious organism, requiring increased levels of carbon dioxide (capnophilic) for optimal growth. It can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\n\n4. Biochemical properties: C. haemolytica is capable of hemolysis, meaning it can break down red blood cells. It also exhibits other enzymatic activities, such as the production of catalase and oxidase.\n\n5. Clinical significance: While C. haemolytica is generally considered a commensal organism, it has been associated with opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions. It has been linked to various clinical manifestations, including bacteremia, endocarditis, and wound infections.\n\nOverall, Capnocytophaga haemolytica is an important member of the oral microbiome, and its potential pathogenic role in certain clinical scenarios warrants further investigation and understanding.",
