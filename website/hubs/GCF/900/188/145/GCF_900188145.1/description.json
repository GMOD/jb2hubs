  "description": "Anaerovirgula multivorans is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It was first isolated from a methanogenic bioreactor treating wastewater.\n\nSome key characteristics of Anaerovirgula multivorans:\n\n1. Cell morphology: Cells are straight or slightly curved rods, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 2-4 μm in length.\n\n2. Motility: Cells are motile, with one to several lateral flagella.\n\n3. Metabolism: Anaerovirgula multivorans is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It is a chemoorganotroph, deriving energy from the oxidation of organic compounds.\n\n4. Substrate utilization: It can utilize a variety of simple carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and xylose, as well as some organic acids like lactate and pyruvate, for growth.\n\n5. Products of metabolism: During fermentative growth, Anaerovirgula multivorans produces acetate, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as the main end products.\n\n6. Habitat and ecology: Anaerovirgula multivorans has been isolated from anaerobic environments, such as methanogenic bioreactors and sediments, where it likely plays a role in the degradation of organic matter and the production of methane.\n\n7. Phylogenetic classification: Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, Anaerovirgula multivorans is classified within the family Clostridiaceae, which is a family of anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria within the phylum Firmicutes.",
