  "description": "Belliella buryatensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in the Buryat Republic, Russia. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the family Cytophagaceae.\n\nBelliella buryatensis is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium. Cells are typically rod-shaped and exhibit gliding motility. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 20-37Â°C and a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Belliella buryatensis is closely related to other members of the genus Belliella, which are known to be versatile in their metabolic capabilities and can degrade a variety of complex organic compounds.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of Belliella buryatensis contribute to our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of bacteria in soil environments, particularly in the Buryat region of Russia.",
