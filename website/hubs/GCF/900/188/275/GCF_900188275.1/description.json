  "description": "Dokdonia pacifica is a species of bacteria that was isolated from seawater collected in the Pacific Ocean. It belongs to the genus Dokdonia, which is a member of the family Cytophagaceae within the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nDokdonia pacifica is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. It is typically rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to glide. The cells are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons has shown that Dokdonia pacifica is closely related to other Dokdonia species, such as Dokdonia donghaensis and Dokdonia spongiicola, which have also been isolated from marine environments.\n\nDokdonia pacifica is considered a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires organic compounds as a source of carbon and energy for growth. It is capable of hydrolyzing various polysaccharides and can utilize a range of different carbon sources.\n\nThe optimal growth conditions for Dokdonia pacifica include a temperature range of 20-30°C and a pH range of 6.5-8.0. It is halophilic, requiring the presence of sodium ions for growth, and is typically found in marine or estuarine environments.\n\nFurther studies on the physiology, ecology, and potential biotechnological applications of Dokdonia pacifica are ongoing to expand our understanding of this species and its role in the marine ecosystem.",
