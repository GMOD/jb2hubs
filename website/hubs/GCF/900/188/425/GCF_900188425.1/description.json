  "description": "Antarctobacter heliothermus is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Antarctica. It is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Alphaproteobacteria.\n\nAntarctobacter heliothermus is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming bacterium. It is psychrotolerant, meaning it can grow at low temperatures, with an optimal growth temperature range of 10-25Â°C. The cells are rod-shaped and motile, with the ability to move using flagella.\n\nThis species is known to be capable of phototrophy, meaning it can use light energy to produce ATP through photosynthesis. It possesses carotenoid pigments, which give the cells a yellow-orange coloration and may play a role in protecting the cells from UV radiation in the Antarctic environment.\n\nAntarctobacter heliothermus is considered an extremophile, as it is adapted to thrive in the harsh environmental conditions of Antarctica, including low temperatures, high UV radiation, and oligotrophic (nutrient-poor) soil. Its ability to utilize light energy and tolerate the stresses of the Antarctic climate makes it an interesting subject of study for understanding microbial adaptations to extreme environments.",
