  "description": "Acinetobacter apis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. It is a Gram-negative, non-motile, and strictly aerobic bacterium. Acinetobacter apis was first isolated from the gut of honeybees (Apis species) and is believed to be a part of the natural microbiome of these important pollinators.\n\nThe cells of Acinetobacter apis are typically coccobacillary in shape and measure around 1-2 micrometers in length. They can grow on a variety of nutrient-rich media, such as tryptic soy agar or nutrient agar, at optimal temperatures ranging from 25°C to 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Acinetobacter apis is closely related to other Acinetobacter species, particularly those found in association with insects or other environmental sources. The presence of Acinetobacter apis in the gut of honeybees suggests that it may play a role in the health and well-being of these crucial pollinators, though its specific functions and interactions within the bee microbiome are still under investigation.",
