  "description": "Vibrio cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961 is a Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacterium that belongs to the Vibrio genus. It is the causative agent of the severe diarrheal disease, cholera.\n\nThe \"O1\" in the name refers to the specific serogroup of V. cholerae, which is determined by the structure of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharide. The \"biovar El Tor\" indicates that this strain belongs to the El Tor biotype, which is distinct from the classical biotype based on various phenotypic and genetic characteristics.\n\nStrain N16961 is a well-studied representative of the El Tor biotype, and its genome has been fully sequenced. It is known to produce cholera toxin, a potent enterotoxin that causes the profuse, watery diarrhea characteristic of cholera. The bacterium can survive in aquatic environments and is typically transmitted through contaminated water or food.\n\nV. cholerae O1 biovar El Tor str. N16961 is an important model organism for understanding the pathogenesis, epidemiology, and evolution of cholera, a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.",
