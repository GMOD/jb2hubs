  "description": "Cereibacter ovatus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. Cereibacter ovatus is typically found in the human gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a role in the gut microbiome.\n\nThe cells of Cereibacter ovatus are ovoid or elliptical in shape, with a size range of approximately 0.5-1.5 μm in length and 0.3-0.8 μm in width. The bacterium is strictly anaerobic, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth and metabolism.\n\nBiochemically, Cereibacter ovatus is known to ferment a variety of carbohydrates, producing lactate, acetate, and other short-chain fatty acids as the primary end-products. This metabolic activity contributes to the overall metabolic functions and energy production within the gut ecosystem.\n\nPhylogenetically, Cereibacter ovatus is closely related to other members of the Firmicutes phylum, particularly within the Ruminococcaceae family, which are commonly found in the human and animal gut microbiomes.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological roles, potential interactions, and potential applications of Cereibacter ovatus in the context of human health and the gut microbiome.",
