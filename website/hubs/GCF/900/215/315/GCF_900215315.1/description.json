  "description": "Arsukibacterium tuosuense is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Tuosu, China. It belongs to the genus Arsukibacterium, which is a member of the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Arsukibacterium tuotuosuense are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and rod-shaped. They are aerobic, meaning they require oxygen for growth and metabolism. The optimum temperature for the growth of this species is around 30Â°C.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Arsukibacterium tuotuosuense is closely related to other species within the genus Arsukibacterium, which are known to be psychrotolerant (able to grow at low temperatures) and halotolerant (able to grow in the presence of high salt concentrations).\n\nThe specific metabolic and physiological characteristics of Arsukibacterium tuotuosuense, as well as its potential ecological roles and applications, are still under investigation by researchers.",
