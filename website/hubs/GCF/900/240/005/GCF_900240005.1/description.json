  "description": "Burkholderia stabilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Burkholderia. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming rod-shaped bacterium. Burkholderia stabilis is known to be a member of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of closely related species that are often found in the environment, particularly in soil and water.\n\nBurkholderia stabilis is primarily associated with human infections, particularly in individuals with cystic fibrosis or other underlying respiratory conditions. It has been identified as an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing various types of infections, such as pneumonia, septicemia, and wound infections. The bacterium is known for its intrinsic resistance to multiple antibiotics, making it a challenging microorganism to treat in clinical settings.\n\nTaxonomically, Burkholderia stabilis was first identified and described in the late 1990s, and it is considered a distinct species within the Burkholderia genus based on its unique phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Research on Burkholderia stabilis continues to contribute to our understanding of its ecology, pathogenicity, and potential clinical implications, particularly in the context of managing infections in vulnerable patient populations.",
