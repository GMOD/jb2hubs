  "description": "Anaerolactibacter massiliensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, coccoid-shaped bacterium. It was isolated from a human stool sample collected in France.\n\nThe key characteristics of Anaerolactibacter massiliensis are:\n\n1. Anaerobic: It can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\n2. Gram-positive: Its cell wall has a thick peptidoglycan layer, which gives it a positive result when stained using the Gram staining technique.\n\n3. Non-spore-forming: It does not form resistant spores to survive adverse environmental conditions.\n\n4. Coccoid-shaped: The cells have a spherical or round morphology.\n\n5. Isolated from human gut: This species was first discovered and isolated from a human fecal sample.\n\nAnaerolactibacter massiliensis is classified within the Firmicutes phylum and is believed to be part of the normal gut microbiome of humans. Further research is needed to understand its exact role and potential interactions within the complex gut microbial community.",
