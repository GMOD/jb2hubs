  "description": "Defluviimonas aquaemixtae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Defluviimonas aquaemixtae was first isolated from a wastewater treatment plant in China.\n\nThe cells of Defluviimonas aquaemixtae are rod-shaped and approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. They are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30-37°C, and it can grow at a pH range of 6.0-8.5.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Defluviimonas aquaemixtae is closely related to other members of the genus Defluviimonas, which are commonly found in various aquatic environments, including wastewater treatment systems. The genus Defluviimonas is classified within the family Xanthobacteraceae.\n\nFurther studies on the physiological and metabolic characteristics of Defluviimonas aquaemixtae may provide insights into its potential role in wastewater treatment and other environmental processes.",
