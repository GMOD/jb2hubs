  "description": "Dialister massiliensis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, coccobacillus-shaped bacterium. It was first isolated from a human stool sample collected in Marseille, France, and is considered part of the normal human gut microbiome.\n\nDialister massiliensis is a member of the Firmicutes phylum, specifically within the Negativicutes class and Veillonellaceae family. It is a strictly anaerobic bacterium, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment to grow and thrive.\n\nColonies of D. massiliensis on agar plates are typically small, circular, and non-pigmented. Biochemically, the bacterium is able to ferment various carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids as end-products of its metabolism.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that D. massiliensis is closely related to other Dialister species, which are commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract and are believed to play a role in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. Further research is ongoing to elucidate the specific ecological functions and potential clinical relevance of this gut-associated bacterial species.",
