  "description": "Actinobacillus ureae is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Pasteurellaceae. It is a commensal bacterium, typically found in the upper respiratory tract of various animal hosts, including humans.\n\nThe key features of Actinobacillus ureae are:\n\n1. Cell morphology: It is a small, straight or slightly curved rod-shaped bacterium, measuring approximately 0.5-1.0 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Oxygen requirements: Actinobacillus ureae is a facultative anaerobe, capable of growing both in the presence and absence of oxygen.\n\n3. Biochemical characteristics: It is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. The bacterium is able to hydrolyze urea, which is its distinguishing characteristic and gives rise to its specific epithet \"ureae.\"\n\n4. Habitat and isolation: Actinobacillus ureae is commonly isolated from the upper respiratory tract of various animal species, including humans, pigs, and cattle. It is considered a commensal organism, typically not causing disease in its host.\n\n5. Taxonomic classification: Actinobacillus ureae belongs to the genus Actinobacillus, which is a member of the family Pasteurellaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThis bacterium has been studied primarily in the context of its role as a commensal organism in the upper respiratory tract of different hosts, and its potential as an opportunistic pathogen in some cases.",
