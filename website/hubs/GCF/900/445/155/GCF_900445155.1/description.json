  "description": "Afipia felis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the family Bradyrhizobiaceae. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Afipia felis was first isolated from the blood of a patient with cat scratch disease, a zoonotic infection caused by Bartonella henselae and transmitted by cats.\n\nThe bacterium is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various clinical manifestations, including lymphadenopathy, fever, and endocarditis. Afipia felis is not a common cause of human infections, but its identification can be important in the diagnosis and management of certain clinical conditions, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nTaxonomically, Afipia felis is closely related to other members of the Afipia genus, which are known to be environmental bacteria found in soil and water. The specific ecological role and niche of Afipia felis in the environment are not fully understood, but its association with cat scratch disease suggests a potential interaction with feline hosts or their environment.",
