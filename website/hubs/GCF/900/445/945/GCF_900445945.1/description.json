  "description": "Bordetella trematum is a Gram-negative, aerobic, coccobacillary bacterium that belongs to the genus Bordetella. It was first isolated from human clinical samples, specifically from wounds and abscesses, in the early 1990s.\n\nThe key features of Bordetella trematum are:\n\n1. Morphology: Bordetella trematum cells are small, ovoid to coccobacillary in shape, and non-spore-forming.\n\n2. Growth characteristics: The bacterium is aerobic and can grow on various microbiological media, such as blood agar and MacConkey agar, at temperatures ranging from 30°C to 37°C.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: Bordetella trematum is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive. It can utilize a limited range of carbohydrates for energy production.\n\n4. Habitat and pathogenicity: Bordetella trematum is considered an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various human clinical conditions, including wound infections, abscesses, and bacteremia, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\n5. Taxonomic classification: Bordetella trematum is classified within the genus Bordetella, which also includes well-known species such as Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough.\n\nOverall, Bordetella trematum is a relatively uncommon human pathogen that has been primarily isolated from clinical samples and is not considered a major public health concern, although its exact role in human disease and epidemiology requires further investigation.",
