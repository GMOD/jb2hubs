  "description": "Capnocytophaga granulosa is a species of gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria that belongs to the Capnocytophaga genus. It is a slow-growing, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nCapnocytophaga granulosa is typically found in the oral cavity of humans and other mammals, where it is considered part of the normal microbial flora. It is an opportunistic pathogen and has been associated with various oral and systemic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe cells of Capnocytophaga granulosa are typically rod-shaped, with a length of approximately 2-6 µm and a width of 0.3-0.5 µm. They exhibit a characteristic granular appearance under the microscope, which is the basis for the species name \"granulosa.\"\n\nCapnocytophaga granulosa is considered a capnophilic bacterium, meaning it has a preference for increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels for optimal growth, typically requiring an atmosphere with 5-10% CO2 for cultivation in the laboratory.\n\nThe bacterium is known to be involved in the production of various enzymes and metabolic byproducts that can contribute to the development of periodontal diseases and other oral infections. Additionally, Capnocytophaga granulosa has been associated with systemic infections, such as bacteremia and sepsis, in immunocompromised patients.",
