  "description": "Vibrio cincinnatiensis is a species of Gram-negative, curved, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Vibrio. It is a facultatively anaerobic, motile bacterium with a single polar flagellum.\n\nVibrio cincinnatiensis was first isolated from water samples collected from the Ohio River in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, hence its species name. It is commonly found in aquatic environments, particularly in estuarine and coastal waters.\n\nThis bacterium is closely related to other pathogenic Vibrio species, such as Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. However, the clinical significance and pathogenicity of Vibrio cincinnatiensis are not well-established, and it is not considered a major human pathogen. Further research is needed to fully understand its ecological role and potential impact on human health.",
