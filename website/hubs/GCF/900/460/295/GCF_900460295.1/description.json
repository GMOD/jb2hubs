  "description": "Vibrio metschnikovii is a Gram-negative, curved or comma-shaped bacterium that belongs to the genus Vibrio. It is a facultative anaerobic, motile bacterium that is capable of swimming using a single polar flagellum.\n\nVibrio metschnikovii was first isolated from the intestines of the common European house fly (Musca domestica) by the Russian bacteriologist Elie Metchnikoff in 1888. It is widely distributed in aquatic environments, including marine and estuarine waters, and has been associated with various aquatic organisms such as fish, shellfish, and crustaceans.\n\nBiochemically, Vibrio metschnikovii is oxidase-positive, indole-positive, and capable of fermenting a variety of carbohydrates. It can grow optimally at temperatures between 20-30Â°C and is halophilic, requiring sodium ions for growth.\n\nWhile Vibrio metschnikovii is not considered a major human pathogen, it has been occasionally isolated from clinical samples, primarily in immunocompromised individuals, and has been associated with a few cases of gastroenteritis and wound infections. Its role in human disease is not well-established, and further research is needed to understand its potential pathogenicity and ecological significance.",
