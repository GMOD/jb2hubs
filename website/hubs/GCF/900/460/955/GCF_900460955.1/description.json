  "description": "Cardiobacterium valvarum is a species of gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria that belongs to the family Cardiobacteriaceae. It is a rare pathogen primarily associated with infective endocarditis, a serious condition involving the inflammation and infection of the heart valves.\n\nThe key features of Cardiobacterium valvarum are:\n\n1. Morphology: It is a small, coccobacillary or rod-shaped bacterium, typically measuring around 0.5-1.5 Î¼m in length.\n\n2. Growth characteristics: Cardiobacterium valvarum is a fastidious organism, requiring enriched media, such as blood agar or chocolate agar, for optimal growth. It can grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\n\n3. Biochemical properties: The bacterium is catalase-positive and oxidase-positive. It can ferment a limited range of carbohydrates, including glucose and maltose.\n\n4. Epidemiology and clinical significance: Cardiobacterium valvarum is a rare cause of infective endocarditis, primarily affecting individuals with underlying heart valve abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. It has been associated with a high mortality rate due to the severity of the resulting endocardial infections.\n\n5. Identification and diagnosis: Cardiobacterium valvarum can be challenging to identify, as it may be mistaken for other slow-growing or fastidious bacteria. Accurate identification often requires molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing, for definitive species-level classification.\n\nOverall, Cardiobacterium valvarum is an uncommon but potentially life-threatening pathogen that primarily targets the heart valves, underscoring the importance of prompt diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial therapy for individuals with suspected infective endocarditis.",
