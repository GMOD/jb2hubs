  "description": "Aggregatibacter segnis ATCC 33393 is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It is a member of the Aggregatibacter genus, which belongs to the Pasteurellaceae family. \n\nAggregatibacter segnis is considered a commensal bacterium, commonly found in the human oral cavity, particularly in the gingival sulcus and periodontal pockets. It is known to be associated with periodontal diseases, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, and has been isolated from patients with various oral and systemic infections.\n\nThe strain ATCC 33393 is the type strain of Aggregatibacter segnis and was originally isolated from the human oral cavity. It exhibits optimal growth at 37Â°C and under microaerophilic conditions. Aggregatibacter segnis is biochemically active, capable of fermenting carbohydrates and producing various enzymes, which contribute to its pathogenic potential in the oral environment.\n\nThis species is of interest in the field of oral microbiology and has been the subject of research investigating its role in the development and progression of periodontal diseases, as well as its potential use as a biomarker or target for therapeutic interventions.",
