  "description": "Vombatus ursinus, commonly known as the common wombat, is a burrowing marsupial native to eastern Australia. It is a stocky, barrel-shaped mammal with a large, rounded head, short limbs, and a short, stubby tail.\n\nThe common wombat has a thick, coarse fur coat that ranges in color from gray to reddish-brown. Its large, rodent-like front teeth and strong claws are adapted for digging extensive burrow systems, which it uses for shelter, protection, and nesting.\n\nWombats are herbivorous, feeding primarily on grasses, herbs, and roots. They are solitary and territorial, with each individual maintaining a complex network of underground burrows. Wombats are known for their slow, lumbering gait and their ability to defend their burrows against predators.\n\nVombatus ursinus plays an important role in the ecosystem, as their burrowing activities help to aerate the soil and create habitats for other small animals. They are considered a keystone species in their native range, contributing to the overall biodiversity and functioning of the ecosystem.",
