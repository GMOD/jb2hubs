  "description": "Notechis scutatus, commonly known as the Australian tiger snake, is a venomous snake species native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Elapidae, which includes some of the world's most deadly snakes.\n\nThe Australian tiger snake is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 60 to 120 cm in length. It has a distinctive banded pattern on its body, with alternating bands of yellow, black, and reddish-brown. The head is relatively small and distinct from the neck, and the eyes are relatively small.\n\nThese snakes are found in a variety of habitats, including coastal regions, wetlands, and grasslands. They are primarily terrestrial and are known to be excellent swimmers, often found near water sources. They are also known to be semi-arboreal, occasionally climbing into low vegetation.\n\nNotechis scutatus is a highly venomous snake, and its venom is considered to be one of the most potent of all Australian snakes. The venom contains a complex mixture of neurotoxins, myotoxins, and coagulants, which can cause significant tissue damage and potentially lead to respiratory failure in humans if left untreated.\n\nThe Australian tiger snake is an important part of the local ecosystem, playing a crucial role in controlling small mammal and reptile populations. It is also of significant interest to the scientific community due to its unique venom composition and potential medical applications.",
