  "description": "Pseudonaja textilis, commonly known as the eastern brown snake, is a highly venomous snake species native to Australia. It belongs to the genus Pseudonaja, which is a group of snakes commonly referred to as \"brown snakes.\"\n\nThe eastern brown snake is a medium-sized snake, typically ranging from 1.2 to 2.5 meters in length. It has a slender, cylindrical body with a relatively small head. The snake's coloration can vary from light to dark brown, with a paler underside. The scales are smooth and glossy, and the snake's eyes are relatively small.\n\nPseudonaja textilis is known for its agile and fast-moving behavior, which makes it a formidable predator. It primarily feeds on small mammals, birds, and other reptiles. The venom of the eastern brown snake is a potent neurotoxin and coagulant, making it one of the most deadly snakes in the world. However, the snake is generally not aggressive towards humans unless provoked or threatened.\n\nThe eastern brown snake is widely distributed across eastern Australia, from southern Queensland to southeastern South Australia. It inhabits a variety of habitats, including grasslands, woodlands, and urban areas. The species plays an important role in the ecosystem, helping to regulate small mammal populations.",
