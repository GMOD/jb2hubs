  "description": "Alistipes megaguti is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium. It belongs to the genus Alistipes, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\nThis species was first isolated from human fecal samples and is found as part of the normal gut microbiome in humans. Alistipes megaguti is considered an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\nGenomic analyses have revealed that Alistipes megaguti has a relatively large genome size compared to other Alistipes species, which may contribute to its adaptability and metabolic capabilities within the gut environment. This bacterium is believed to play a role in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, contributing to the overall functioning of the human gut microbiome.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to elucidate the specific ecological and functional roles of Alistipes megaguti within the complex gut microbial community and its potential associations with human health and disease.",
