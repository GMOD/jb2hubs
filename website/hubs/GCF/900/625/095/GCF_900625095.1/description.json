  "description": "Acinetobacter ihumii is a species of gram-negative, aerobic, non-motile, coccobacillus-shaped bacteria that belongs to the genus Acinetobacter. It was first isolated from a soil sample collected in Ihumi, Japan.\n\nThe cells of Acinetobacter ihumii are approximately 1-2 μm in length and 0.5-1 μm in width. They are typically arranged singly or in pairs. The bacterium is strictly aerobic and can grow on various nutrient-rich media, such as tryptic soy agar or nutrient agar, at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nAcinetobacter ihumii is catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. It is capable of utilizing a range of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, and various organic acids, for its energy and growth requirements. The bacterium is also known to exhibit resistance to certain antibiotics, which is a characteristic shared by many Acinetobacter species.\n\nTaxonomically, Acinetobacter ihumii is classified within the family Moraxellaceae and is closely related to other Acinetobacter species, such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, which are known for their clinical importance and association with nosocomial infections.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to elucidate the ecological roles, metabolic capabilities, and potential applications of Acinetobacter ihumii in various environmental and biotechnological contexts.",
