  "description": "Anaerococcus vaginimassiliensis is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid-shaped bacterium that was isolated from the vaginal microbiome of a healthy woman. It belongs to the genus Anaerococcus, which is a member of the Firmicutes phylum.\n\nThe cells of Anaerococcus vaginimassiliensis are non-spore-forming and non-motile. They typically arrange in pairs or short chains. The bacterium is considered a strict anaerobe, meaning it requires an oxygen-free environment for growth and metabolism.\n\nBiochemically, Anaerococcus vaginimassiliensis is able to ferment various carbohydrates and produce lactic acid as the main end-product. It is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that Anaerococcus vaginimassiliensis is closely related to other Anaerococcus species, sharing high sequence similarity with them. It was first isolated and described in 2012 from a vaginal sample collected from a healthy woman in Marseille, France.\n\nThe presence of Anaerococcus vaginimassiliensis in the vaginal microbiome is believed to be part of the normal, commensal bacterial community found in some healthy women. However, its exact role and potential interactions with the host or other vaginal microorganisms are still under investigation.",
