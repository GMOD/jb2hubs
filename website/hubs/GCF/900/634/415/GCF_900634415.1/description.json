  "description": "Cottoperca gobio, commonly known as the bullhead or river bull, is a species of fish belonging to the family Bovichtidae. It is found in rivers and estuaries of southern South America, primarily in Argentina and Chile.\n\nThe Cottoperca gobio is a small, benthic fish, typically reaching a maximum length of around 20 centimeters. It has a large, flattened head and a wide, gaping mouth, which is an adaptation for its carnivorous diet, feeding on small invertebrates and other fish. The body is elongated and slightly compressed, with a smooth, scaleless skin that is typically olive-brown or gray in color, with darker mottling or blotches.\n\nThis species is known to inhabit slow-moving or stagnant freshwater and brackish environments, where it takes refuge among submerged vegetation, rocks, and other structures. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, serving as prey for larger predatory fish and piscivorous birds.\n\nThe Cottoperca gobio is considered a relatively common and widespread species within its native range, though its population status and conservation needs may vary depending on local environmental conditions and threats.",
