  "description": "Actinobacillus equuli is a species of Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Pasteurellaceae. It is a commensal bacterium commonly found in the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive tract of horses and other equine species.\n\nA. equuli is considered an opportunistic pathogen and can cause various infections in horses, such as pneumonia, septicemia, joint infections, and abscesses. The bacterium is known to produce several virulence factors, including adhesins, toxins, and enzymes, which contribute to its ability to colonize and cause disease in the host.\n\nPhenotypically, A. equuli is catalase-positive, oxidase-variable, and requires specific growth factors, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), for optimal growth. Biochemically, it can ferment a range of carbohydrates and produce acid from various sugars.\n\nTaxonomically, A. equuli was initially classified as Bacillus equuli, but later reclassified into the genus Actinobacillus based on its phylogenetic and biochemical characteristics. The species is considered an important member of the equine microbiome and a potential contributor to various infectious diseases in horses.",
