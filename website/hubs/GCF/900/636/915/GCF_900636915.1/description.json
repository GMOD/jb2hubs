  "description": "Aggregatibacter aphrophilus ATCC 33389 is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, capnophilic bacterium that belongs to the family Pasteurellaceae. It is a member of the normal oral microbiome and is commonly found in the human upper respiratory tract and oral cavity.\n\nThis species is characterized by its requirement for increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels for optimal growth, hence the term \"capnophilic.\" It is a non-spore-forming, non-motile coccobacillus or short rod-shaped bacterium.\n\nAggregatibacter aphrophilus ATCC 33389 is known to be involved in various opportunistic infections, such as infective endocarditis, brain abscesses, and other systemic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It is often isolated from clinical specimens, including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids.\n\nThe identification and characterization of this species are typically performed using biochemical tests, growth requirements, and molecular techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Understanding the properties and potential pathogenic role of Aggregatibacter aphrophilus ATCC 33389 is crucial for appropriate clinical management and epidemiological surveillance.",
