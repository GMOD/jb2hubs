  "description": "Actinomadura formosensis is a species of actinobacteria that was first isolated from soil collected in Formosa (now Taiwan). It is a Gram-positive, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the genus Actinomadura.\n\nThe cells of A. formosensis are typically rod-shaped or coccoid in morphology and can form branched, substrate and aerial mycelia. The bacterium is capable of hydrolyzing starch, casein, and gelatin, but it cannot utilize cellulose as a carbon source.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. formosensis is closely related to other Actinomadura species and is classified within the family Thermomonosporaceae. The optimum growth temperature for this species is around 28-30Â°C, and it can tolerate a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nActinomadura formosensis has been studied for its potential in producing bioactive compounds, such as antibiotics, and its role in soil ecology and nutrient cycling. However, its full ecological function and biotechnological applications are still under investigation.",
