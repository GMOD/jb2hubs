  "description": "Desulfoluna butyratoxydans is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from marine sediments. It is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, and motile bacterium that is capable of utilizing butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid, as its primary carbon and energy source.\n\nThe cells of Desulfoluna butyratoxydans are curved rods, approximately 1.2-2.0 μm in length and 0.5-0.7 μm in width. They are capable of growth at temperatures ranging from 10°C to 40°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nThis species is known to be capable of reducing sulfate to sulfide, which is an important process in the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur in marine environments. The ability to oxidize butyrate coupled with sulfate reduction is a key metabolic characteristic of Desulfoluna butyratoxydans.\n\nPhylogenetically, Desulfoluna butyratoxydans belongs to the class Deltaproteobacteria, within the order Desulfobacterales. It is closely related to other sulfate-reducing bacteria found in marine sediments and anoxic environments.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of Desulfoluna butyratoxydans has contributed to our understanding of the diversity and ecological roles of sulfate-reducing bacteria in marine ecosystems.",
