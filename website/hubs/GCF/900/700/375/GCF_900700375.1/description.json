It is found in the rivers and lakes of western Africa, primarily in countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Denticeps clupeoides is a small, slender fish with a maximum length of around 10 centimeters. It has a distinct set of teeth along the jaws, hence the name \"toothfish.\" The fish's body is laterally compressed, and it has a forked tail fin. Its coloration is typically silvery or grayish, with a darker dorsal region and lighter ventral area.\n\nThis species is known to feed on small invertebrates and plankton found in its aquatic habitats.

However, like many freshwater species, it may face threats from habitat degradation, pollution, and overexploitation in certain regions.",
