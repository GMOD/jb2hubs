  "description": "Corylus avellana, commonly known as the common hazelnut or European hazel, is a species of hazelnut native to Europe and Asia Minor. It is a large shrub or small tree that can grow up to 12 meters (39 feet) tall.\n\nThe leaves of Corylus avellana are broadly ovate, 6-12 cm (2.4-4.7 inches) long and 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) broad, with a rounded base and a pointed tip. The flowers are produced in early spring before the leaves, and are wind-pollinated catkins.\n\nThe edible nuts are produced in clusters of 1-5, enclosed in a green, leafy involucre (husk) that extends beyond the nut. The nuts are 15-20 mm (0.6-0.8 inches) long and 12-15 mm (0.5-0.6 inches) broad.\n\nCorylus avellana is cultivated commercially for its edible nuts, which are an important food crop. The nuts are high in protein, fats, vitamins, and minerals, and are widely used in confectionery and baking. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly grown as a landscape shrub.",
