  "description": "Sphaeramia orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular batfish or circular batfish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Platacidae. It is found in the Indo-Pacific region, from the Red Sea and East Africa to Samoa and the Mariana Islands.\n\nThe Sphaeramia orbicularis is a small, disc-shaped fish that can grow up to 20 cm in length. Its body is laterally compressed, giving it a distinctive circular or orbicular shape, which is the origin of its common name. The fish has a large, protruding mouth and a small, pointed snout. Its coloration is typically brown or gray, with a pattern of dark vertical bars or stripes on its body.\n\nSphaeramia orbicularis is found in shallow, coastal reef environments, often in association with coral reefs or rocky habitats. It is a schooling species, often observed in groups swimming close to the seafloor or around reef structures. The fish feeds primarily on small crustaceans, zooplankton, and algae.\n\nRegarding its behavior and ecology, Sphaeramia orbicularis is known to exhibit a unique defensive mechanism. When threatened, it can inflate its body, becoming more rounded and increasing its apparent size, in an attempt to deter predators.\n\nOverall, the Sphaeramia orbicularis is a common and widely distributed species in the Indo-Pacific region, playing a role in the overall biodiversity and ecological balance of coral reef ecosystems.",
