  "description": "Anaerosalibacter massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human stool sample. It belongs to the phylum Firmicutes and the class Clostridia. \n\nAnaerosalibacter massiliensis is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacterium. It is catalase-negative and oxidase-negative. Cells are coccoid to rod-shaped, with a diameter of approximately 0.5-0.8 µm and a length of 1.0-2.0 µm.\n\nThe optimum growth temperature for Anaerosalibacter massiliensis is around 37°C, and it can grow in the pH range of 6.5 to 8.0. It is able to ferment various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, producing mainly acetate, lactate, and hydrogen as end products.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Anaerosalibacter massiliensis is most closely related to other members of the genus Anaerosalibacter, which are also anaerobic, Gram-positive bacteria isolated from human or animal gut environments.\n\nThe isolation and characterization of Anaerosalibacter massiliensis contributes to our understanding of the diversity and potential roles of anaerobic bacteria within the human gut microbiome.",
