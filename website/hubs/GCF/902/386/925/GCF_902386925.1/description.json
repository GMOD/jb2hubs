  "description": "Arabiibacter massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human stool sample collected in Marseille, France. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes, which is a group of gram-negative, anaerobic bacteria commonly found in the human gut microbiome.\n\nThe cells of A. massiliensis are non-spore-forming, non-motile, and rod-shaped. They measure approximately 0.5-0.7 μm in width and 1.2-2.5 μm in length. The optimal growth temperature for this species is 37°C, and it can tolerate a pH range of 6.5 to 8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that A. massiliensis is most closely related to other members of the genus Arabiibacter, which was recently established to accommodate bacteria isolated from various environmental samples.\n\nThe genome of A. massiliensis has been sequenced, revealing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential role in the human gut ecosystem. Further research is needed to understand the ecological significance and potential interactions of this species within the complex gut microbiome.",
