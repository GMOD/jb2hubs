  "description": "Geotrypetes seraphini, commonly known as the West African caecilian, is a species of limbless amphibian belonging to the order Gymnophiona. This small, burrowing caecilian is found in West Africa, primarily in countries such as Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Guinea.\n\nGeotrypetes seraphini is a small caecilian, typically measuring around 20-30 centimeters in length. Its body is cylindrical and elongated, with a blunt, rounded head and a lack of external limbs. The skin is smooth and annulated, with a dark brown or grayish coloration.\n\nThese caecilians are adapted to a fossorial, or burrowing, lifestyle. They use their pointed heads and muscular bodies to move through the soil, feeding on small invertebrates, such as earthworms and insect larvae. Geotrypetes seraphini is a viviparous species, meaning the female gives birth to live young, rather than laying eggs.\n\nThe habitat of the West African caecilian is typically moist, tropical forests and riverine areas. They are rarely encountered on the surface, spending most of their time underground or in leaf litter. Due to their secretive nature and burrowing habits, the population status and ecology of this species are not well-studied.",
