  "description": "Desulfoluna spongiiphila is a species of sulfate-reducing bacteria that was isolated from a marine sponge. It is an anaerobic, gram-negative, non-spore-forming bacterium that belongs to the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Desulfoluna spongiiphila are curved rods, approximately 2-4 μm in length and 0.5-0.8 μm in width. They are motile and possess a single polar flagellum.\n\nThis species is capable of using sulfate, thiosulfate, and elemental sulfur as terminal electron acceptors during anaerobic respiration, reducing them to sulfide. It can utilize a variety of organic compounds, such as lactate, pyruvate, and succinate, as carbon and energy sources.\n\nDesulfoluna spongiiphila was originally isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai, which was collected from the coast of Japan. It is believed to play a role in the sulfur cycle within the sponge's microbiome, contributing to the sponge's overall metabolism and nutrient cycling.\n\nThe species is of interest in the field of marine microbiology and sponge ecology, as it provides insights into the complex interactions between sponges and their associated microbial communities.",
