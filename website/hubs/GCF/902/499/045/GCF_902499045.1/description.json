  "description": "Burkholderia latens is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Burkholderia. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic, and motile bacterium. Burkholderia latens was first isolated from soil samples collected in Thailand.\n\nThe cells of Burkholderia latens are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. The bacterium is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 42°C, with an optimal growth temperature of around 30°C.\n\nBurkholderia latens is known to possess various metabolic capabilities, including the ability to utilize a wide range of carbon sources for energy and growth. The bacterium has been found to be resistant to several antibiotics, which may contribute to its environmental adaptability and potential pathogenicity.\n\nPhylogenetically, Burkholderia latens is closely related to other species within the Burkholderia genus, which are known to include both environmental and pathogenic bacteria. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecological role and potential applications of Burkholderia latens in various settings.",
