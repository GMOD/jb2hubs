  "description": "Buttiauxella massiliensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from a human stool sample in Marseille, France. It belongs to the genus Buttiauxella, which is a member of the family Enterobacteriaceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nB. massiliensis is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and motile rod-shaped bacterium. It can grow on various nutrient-rich media and exhibits optimal growth at temperatures around 37Â°C (body temperature).\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that B. massiliensis is genetically distinct from other known Buttiauxella species, sharing approximately 97% sequence similarity with the closest related species. This level of genetic divergence suggests that B. massiliensis represents a novel species within the genus Buttiauxella.\n\nFurther studies are needed to elucidate the ecological niche, potential pathogenicity, and other physiological and biochemical characteristics of this recently described bacterial species.",
