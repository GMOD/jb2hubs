  "description": "Collinsella intestinalis is a species of anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that belongs to the genus Collinsella within the phylum Actinobacteria. It is found primarily in the human gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the lower intestine or colon.\n\nCollinsella intestinalis is a rod-shaped, non-spore-forming microorganism that typically measures between 0.3 to 0.5 micrometers in width and 0.6 to 1.2 micrometers in length. It is considered a commensal bacterium, meaning it resides within the human gut without causing any known harm to the host.\n\nThis species is known to be involved in the fermentation of carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids, which can contribute to the overall metabolic processes and gut health of the human host. Collinsella intestinalis has also been studied for its potential roles in maintaining a balanced gut microbiome and potential associations with certain health conditions.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the specific ecological and functional roles of Collinsella intestinalis within the complex and dynamic human gut ecosystem.",
