  "description": "Scyliorhinus canicula, commonly known as the small-spotted catshark or lesser-spotted dogfish, is a small species of catshark belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, typically inhabiting coastal waters at depths ranging from a few meters to around 400 meters.\n\nThe small-spotted catshark is a small, slender shark with a rounded snout and a relatively long, cylindrical body. It typically reaches a maximum length of around 80 centimeters, with females generally being larger than males. The shark's coloration is variable, ranging from grayish-brown to reddish-brown, with numerous small, dark spots covering its body and fins.\n\nScyliorhinus canicula is a bottom-dwelling, nocturnal species that feeds primarily on small bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods. It is an ovoviviparous species, meaning that the embryos develop within the mother's body and are nourished by the yolk sac, with the offspring being born live.\n\nDue to its relatively small size and abundance, the small-spotted catshark is not considered a significant threat to humans and is often used in scientific research and as a food source in some regions. However, like many other shark species, it faces threats from overfishing and habitat degradation, and its conservation status is classified as \"Least Concern\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
