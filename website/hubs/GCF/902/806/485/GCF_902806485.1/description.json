  "description": "Candidatus Frankia alpina is a proposed species of actinobacteria that is considered a \"Candidatus\" species, meaning it has not been fully characterized and cultured in a laboratory setting. It is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with certain species of plants, specifically those in the Elaeagnaceae family, which includes plants such as Russian olive and sea buckthorn.\n\nCandidatus Frankia alpina is believed to inhabit the root nodules of these host plants, where it can fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plant in exchange for carbohydrates produced by the plant through photosynthesis. This mutualistic relationship is important for the growth and survival of the host plants, particularly in nutrient-poor or nitrogen-limited environments.\n\nThe \"alpina\" in the species name refers to the fact that this bacterium has been primarily identified in plant roots found in alpine or high-altitude regions, suggesting it may be adapted to thrive in these cooler, harsher environments. However, further research is needed to fully understand the ecology, physiology, and genomic characteristics of this Candidatus species.",
