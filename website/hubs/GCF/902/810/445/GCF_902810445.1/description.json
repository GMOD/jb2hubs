  "description": "Candidatus Nitrosacidococcus tergens is a recently discovered species of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria that belongs to the phylum Thaumarchaeota. This species was first identified and characterized from acidic soil samples collected in Japan.\n\nCandidatus Nitrosacidococcus tergens is a coccoid-shaped, obligate aerobic organism that is capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth. It obtains energy through the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, a process known as nitrification. This process is important in the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in acidic soil environments.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has placed Candidatus Nitrosacidococcus tergens within the Thaumarchaeota, a distinct archaeal phylum known to harbor ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms. The species name \"tergens\" refers to its ability to thrive in acidic conditions, as it has been found to grow optimally at pH levels around 4.\n\nFurther research is needed to fully understand the ecological role and metabolic capabilities of this recently discovered acidophilic ammonia-oxidizing archaeon and its contribution to nitrogen cycling in acidic terrestrial ecosystems.",
