  "description": "Candidatus Frankia nodulisporulans is a proposed species of actinobacteria that has been identified through metagenomics and phylogenetic analysis. It belongs to the genus Frankia, which comprises a group of nitrogen-fixing, root-nodule forming bacteria that establish symbiotic relationships with a wide range of woody, deciduous plants.\n\nCandidatus Frankia nodulisporulans was initially discovered and characterized based on its genomic sequence obtained from environmental samples. It is considered a \"Candidatus\" species, which means it has not yet been isolated in pure culture and studied in detail, but its existence has been inferred from molecular data.\n\nThe key features of Candidatus Frankia nodulisporulans, based on the available genomic information, are:\n\n1. It is a slow-growing, filamentous actinobacterium that can form root nodules in symbiosis with its host plants.\n2. The genome suggests it has the genetic potential to fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to its plant partners.\n3. It appears to be phylogenetically distinct from other known Frankia species, indicating it represents a novel lineage within the genus.\n4. The specific plant host associations and ecological roles of Candidatus Frankia nodulisporulans are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.\n\nOverall, Candidatus Frankia nodulisporulans represents an interesting addition to the diversity of nitrogen-fixing Frankia bacteria, and its further characterization may provide insights into the evolution and functional diversity of this important group of plant symbionts.",
