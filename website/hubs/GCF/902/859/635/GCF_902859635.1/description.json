  "description": "Achromobacter marplatensis is a species of bacteria that was first isolated from soil samples collected in Mar del Plata, Argentina. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming bacterium. Cells of A. marplatensis are typically rod-shaped and motile with the help of peritrichous flagella.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. marplatensis belongs to the genus Achromobacter, which is a part of the Betaproteobacteria class within the Proteobacteria phylum. The species is known to be able to grow at temperatures ranging from 4째C to 37째C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28째C-30째C.\n\nBiochemically, A. marplatensis is oxidase-positive and catalase-positive. It can utilize a variety of organic compounds as carbon and energy sources, including carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids. The bacterium is considered non-pathogenic and has not been associated with any known human or animal diseases.\n\nFurther research on the ecological role, metabolic capabilities, and potential biotechnological applications of A. marplatensis may provide additional insights into this bacterial species.",
