  "description": "Achromobacter piechaudii is a species of gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming bacteria that belongs to the genus Achromobacter. It is a motile bacterium, characterized by its ability to move using its peritrichous flagella.\n\nAchromobacter piechaudii was first isolated from clinical samples and is considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions. It has been associated with various types of infections, including bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.\n\nTaxonomically, Achromobacter piechaudii is classified within the family Alcaligenaceae, which also includes other medically relevant genera such as Bordetella and Alcaligenes. The species is named after the French microbiologist Fernand Piechaud, who contributed to the identification and characterization of this bacterial species.\n\nAchromobacter piechaudii is known to be resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents, making it a challenging pathogen to treat, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Further research is ongoing to better understand the epidemiology, virulence factors, and clinical significance of this opportunistic microorganism.",
