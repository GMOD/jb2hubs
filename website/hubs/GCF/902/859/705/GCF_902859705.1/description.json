  "description": "Achromobacter deleyi is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Achromobacter. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium.\n\nSome key characteristics of Achromobacter deleyi:\n\n1. Morphology: Achromobacter deleyi cells are typically rod-shaped, with a size range of 0.3-0.5 μm in width and 0.8-2.0 μm in length.\n\n2. Habitat: Achromobacter deleyi is commonly found in various environmental sources, such as soil, water, and clinical samples.\n\n3. Physiology: It is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for growth and metabolism. It is also oxidase-positive and catalase-positive.\n\n4. Biochemical properties: Achromobacter deleyi can utilize a variety of carbon sources for energy and can produce acid from certain carbohydrates.\n\n5. Pathogenicity: Achromobacter deleyi is generally considered an opportunistic pathogen, meaning it can cause infections in individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions. It has been associated with various clinical infections, such as respiratory tract infections, bacteremia, and wound infections.\n\n6. Taxonomy and identification: Achromobacter deleyi was first isolated and described in 2007. It is classified within the Achromobacter genus, which is part of the Alcaligenaceae family in the Betaproteobacteria class.\n\nOverall, Achromobacter deleyi is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that can occasionally cause opportunistic infections in susceptible individuals.",
