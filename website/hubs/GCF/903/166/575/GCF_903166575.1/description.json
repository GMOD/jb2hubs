  "description": "Chryseobacterium schmidteae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Chryseobacterium, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and aerobic bacterium.\n\nChryseobacterium schmidteae was first isolated from the gut of a butterfly, Pieris brassicae, and was named after Dr. Angelika Schmidt, a German microbiologist who contributed to the study of insect-associated bacteria.\n\nThis bacterium is yellow-pigmented, due to the production of carotenoid pigments, which can help protect it from UV radiation and oxidative stress. It is capable of hydrolyzing various macromolecules, such as casein, gelatin, and starch, indicating its ability to break down complex organic compounds for energy and nutrient acquisition.\n\nChryseobacterium schmidteae is considered an environmental bacterium, as it has been found in various habitats, including soil, water, and the gastrointestinal tracts of insects and other animals. Its presence in the gut of Pieris brassicae suggests a potential symbiotic or commensal relationship with its insect host, though the specific nature of this interaction is still under investigation.",
