  "description": "Nymphalis io, commonly known as the peacock butterfly, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Nymphalidae. It is a large and distinctive butterfly, with a wingspan of around 60-80 millimeters.\n\nThe most striking feature of the Nymphalis io is its large, eye-like spots on the hindwings, which are responsible for its common name. These eyespots are believed to serve as a form of defense, as they can startle predators and deter them from attacking the butterfly.\n\nThe upper side of the wings is primarily orange-red in color, with dark veins and black markings. The underside of the wings is more muted, with a pattern of brown, gray, and black that helps the butterfly blend in with its surroundings when at rest.\n\nNymphalis io is found across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is known for its ability to migrate long distances. The species typically inhabits woodland, grassland, and garden habitats, where its caterpillars feed on plants such as stinging nettles.\n\nOverall, the Nymphalis io is a striking and well-known member of the butterfly family, recognized for its distinctive appearance and fascinating behavioral adaptations.",
