  "description": "Pieris brassicae, commonly known as the Large White or Cabbage White, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Pieridae. It is a widespread and well-known species found across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nThe Large White is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of around 60-70 millimeters. The upper wings of the male are white with black tips, while the female has additional black spots on the upper wings. The underside of the wings is pale yellow with dark veins.\n\nPieris brassicae larvae, commonly referred to as cabbage worms, are green in color with a faint yellow stripe along the back and sides. They feed primarily on plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbages, broccoli, and cauliflower, which can make them agricultural pests.\n\nThe life cycle of the Large White includes four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). The species can have multiple generations per year, with the larvae playing a significant role in the ecology of the habitats they inhabit.\n\nPieris brassicae is an important part of the ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators, including birds, small mammals, and other insects. Additionally, the adults play a role in the pollination of plants as they feed on nectar.",
