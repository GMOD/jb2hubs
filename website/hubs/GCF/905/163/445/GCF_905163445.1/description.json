  "description": "Pararge aegeria, commonly known as the speckled wood or wood argus, is a butterfly species belonging to the family Nymphalidae. This species is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, and it is widely distributed across its range.\n\nThe speckled wood butterfly is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 40-50 millimeters. The upper side of the wings is dark brown, with distinctive creamy-white or yellow spots and patches. The underside of the wings is paler, with a pattern of darker brown spots and patches.\n\nPararge aegeria is typically found in wooded habitats, including deciduous forests, mixed woodlands, and urban parks. The larvae (caterpillars) of this species feed on various grasses, such as Poa annua and Dactylis glomerata, while the adults feed on nectar from a variety of flowering plants.\n\nThe life cycle of the speckled wood butterfly involves a complete metamorphosis, with the egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. Depending on the geographic location, the species can have one or more generations per year, and the timing of the life cycle stages can vary accordingly.\n\nPararge aegeria is an important component of the ecosystems it inhabits, playing a role in pollination and serving as a food source for various predators. The species has also been used as a model organism in ecological and evolutionary research studies.",
