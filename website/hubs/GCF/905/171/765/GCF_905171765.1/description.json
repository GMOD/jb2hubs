  "description": "Bufo bufo, commonly known as the common toad or European toad, is a species of toad that belongs to the family Bufonidae. It is native to Europe and parts of North Africa.\n\nThe common toad is a medium-sized amphibian, typically measuring between 8-15 cm in length. Its body is stocky and rounded, with a warty skin that can range in color from various shades of brown, gray, or olive. The toad has prominent parotid glands behind its eyes, which secrete a toxic substance as a defense mechanism against predators.\n\nBufo bufo is a terrestrial species that inhabits a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and urban areas. It is nocturnal and spends much of the day hiding under rocks, logs, or in burrows. During the breeding season, the common toad migrates to aquatic habitats, such as ponds and lakes, where it engages in a characteristic mating call.\n\nThe common toad is an important part of the ecosystem, as it plays a role in controlling insect populations and serving as a food source for various predators. It is considered a relatively common and widespread species, although its populations may be declining in some areas due to factors such as habitat loss and fragmentation.",
