  "description": "Rana temporaria, commonly known as the common frog or European common frog, is a species of frog belonging to the family Ranidae. This amphibian is native to Europe, ranging from the British Isles to central Russia and from northern Scandinavia to the Mediterranean region.\n\nThe common frog is a medium-sized frog, typically measuring 6-9 cm in length. Its body is stocky, with a rounded snout and prominent eyes. The dorsal (upper) surface of the frog is typically brown, green, or reddish-brown, often with dark spots or patches. The ventral (underside) is typically pale or whitish.\n\nRana temporaria is a semi-aquatic species, spending most of its time in damp habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. It is an opportunistic predator, feeding on a variety of small invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and small vertebrates.\n\nThe common frog is an important part of many European ecosystems, playing a crucial role in the food chain as both a predator and prey species. It is also a valuable indicator of environmental health, as it is sensitive to changes in water quality and habitat degradation.\n\nOverall, the common frog is a widespread and well-studied species that provides valuable insights into the ecology and conservation of amphibian populations in Europe.",
