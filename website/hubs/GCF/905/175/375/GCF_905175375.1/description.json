  "description": "Chryseobacterium aquaeductus is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Chryseobacterium genus, which is part of the Flavobacteriaceae family. It is a Gram-negative, aerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium.\n\nC. aquaeductus was first isolated from drinking water pipeline biofilms in Germany. It is capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 4°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 28°C. The bacterium is oxidase-positive and can hydrolyze various substrates, such as starch, gelatin, and Tween 80.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that C. aquaeductus is closely related to other Chryseobacterium species, such as C. joostei and C. indologenes. The genome of C. aquaeductus has been sequenced, providing insights into its genetic and metabolic capabilities.\n\nOverall, C. aquaeductus is a member of the Chryseobacterium genus, which are known to be prevalent in various aquatic environments and have potential applications in bioremediation and biotechnology.",
