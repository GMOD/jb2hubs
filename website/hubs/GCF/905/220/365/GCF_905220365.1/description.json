  "description": "Vanessa cardui, commonly known as the painted lady or cosmopolitan, is a butterfly species that belongs to the family Nymphalidae. It is one of the most widely distributed butterfly species in the world, found on every continent except Antarctica.\n\nThe painted lady has a wingspan of approximately 5-6 inches (12-15 cm). The upper side of the wings is orange-brown with black and white markings, while the underside is patterned in shades of brown and gray. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females generally having more pronounced markings and a more muted coloration compared to the males.\n\nVanessa cardui is known for its remarkable migratory behavior, with some populations undertaking long-distance migrations spanning thousands of miles. The species' larvae, or caterpillars, feed on a variety of host plants, primarily from the Asteraceae family, such as thistles and burdocks.\n\nThe painted lady is considered a generalist species, able to adapt to a wide range of habitats, from deserts and grasslands to urban areas. Its resilience and adaptability contribute to its global distribution and success as a species.",
