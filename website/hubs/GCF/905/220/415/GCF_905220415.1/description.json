  "description": "Colias croceus, commonly known as the Clouded Yellow, is a species of butterfly belonging to the family Pieridae. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nThe Clouded Yellow has a distinctive bright yellow or orange-yellow upper wing color with dark wing borders. The hindwings have a faint greenish-yellow tinge. The underside of the wings is paler, with a series of small spots or spots along the outer edge. The wingspan typically ranges from 50 to 60 millimeters.\n\nColias croceus is a migratory species, with populations moving northward in the spring and southward in the autumn. The adults feed on the nectar of various flowering plants, while the larvae (caterpillars) feed on legumes such as clover, alfalfa, and vetch.\n\nThe life cycle of the Clouded Yellow involves egg-laying, larval development, pupation, and emergence of the adult butterfly. The species can have multiple generations per year, with the number varying depending on the geographic location and climatic conditions.\n\nColias croceus is considered a common and widespread species across its range, with populations generally stable. However, it can be vulnerable to habitat loss and changes in agricultural practices that affect its host plant resources.",
