  "description": "Salmo salar, commonly known as the Atlantic salmon, is an anadromous species of fish that belongs to the family Salmonidae. The Atlantic salmon is native to the cold, clear waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, ranging from eastern North America to northern Europe.\n\nPhysically, the Atlantic salmon is a streamlined, fusiform fish with a silver-gray coloration on the back and sides, and a white belly. They have a distinctive adipose fin and can grow up to 150 cm in length and weigh up to 45 kg, though the average size is typically much smaller.\n\nBiologically, the Atlantic salmon is an anadromous species, meaning they migrate between freshwater and saltwater environments during their life cycle. They hatch and spend the early part of their lives in rivers and streams, before migrating to the ocean to feed and grow. After several years at sea, they return to their natal rivers to spawn, completing the cycle.\n\nThe species is known for its impressive leaping ability, which allows them to navigate upstream against strong currents and rapids during their spawning migration. Atlantic salmon play a crucial ecological role, serving as an important food source for a variety of predators and contributing to the overall health of the aquatic ecosystems they inhabit.",
