  "description": "Dicentrarchus labrax, commonly known as the European sea bass or simply sea bass, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Moronidae. It is a popular commercial and recreational fish species found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea.\n\nThe European sea bass is a teleost fish, meaning it has a bony skeleton and a well-developed vertebral column. It has an elongated, streamlined body with a large, slightly protruding mouth and two separate dorsal fins. The fish typically ranges in color from silvery-white to dark gray on the upper body, with a lighter, sometimes yellowish, underside.\n\nDicentrarchus labrax is a predatory fish, feeding primarily on smaller fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. It is an important species in commercial and recreational fisheries, and is also widely cultivated in aquaculture due to its desirable characteristics, such as rapid growth, high market value, and adaptability to captive conditions.\n\nThe species is known for its migratory behavior, with some populations undertaking seasonal movements between coastal and offshore areas for spawning and feeding. It is a euryhaline fish, meaning it can tolerate a wide range of salinities, allowing it to inhabit both marine and estuarine environments.\n\nThe European sea bass is an important component of marine ecosystems, serving as both a predator and prey in the food web. It is subject to various conservation and management efforts to ensure the sustainability of its populations.",
