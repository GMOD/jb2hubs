  "description": "Cupriavidus numazuensis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Cupriavidus. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Cupriavidus numazuensis was first isolated from soil samples collected in Numazu, Japan.\n\nThe cells of C. numazuensis are approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. They are motile, possessing a single polar flagellum. The optimal growth temperature for this species is around 30°C, and it can grow in a pH range of 6.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. numazuensis is closely related to other Cupriavidus species, such as C. metallidurans and C. necator. It is capable of oxidizing various organic compounds and can tolerate moderate levels of heavy metals, including copper and nickel.\n\nThe genome of C. numazuensis has been sequenced, providing insights into its metabolic capabilities and potential environmental adaptations. Further research on this species may contribute to our understanding of bacterial diversity and their roles in nutrient cycling and bioremediation processes in soil ecosystems.",
