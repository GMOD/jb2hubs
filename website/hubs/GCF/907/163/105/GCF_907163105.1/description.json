  "description": "Cloacibacterium caeni is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from activated sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant in China.\n\nThe cells of Cloacibacterium caeni are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and non-motile. They are rod-shaped, measuring approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.5 μm in length. The colonies formed by this bacterium on agar plates are circular, convex, and pale yellow in color.\n\nCloacibacterium caeni is an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for its growth and metabolism. It is chemoorganotrophic, utilizing organic compounds as its carbon and energy sources. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Cloacibacterium caeni is closely related to other members of the genus Cloacibacterium, which are commonly found in various environmental samples, such as wastewater, sludge, and soil.\n\nThe role and specific functions of Cloacibacterium caeni in its natural environment, such as in wastewater treatment processes, are not yet fully understood and require further investigation.",
