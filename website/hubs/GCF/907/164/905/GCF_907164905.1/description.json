  "description": "Dyadobacter helix is a species of bacteria that belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It was first isolated from soil collected in China. The cells of Dyadobacter helix are gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They exhibit a distinctive spiral or helical shape, which is the basis for the species name \"helix.\"\n\nDyadobacter helix is considered a mesophilic bacterium, meaning it thrives in moderate temperature ranges, typically between 20°C and 37°C. The optimal growth temperature for this species is reported to be around 30°C.\n\nColonies of Dyadobacter helix on agar plates are typically yellow or orange in color due to the production of carotenoid pigments. These pigments may play a role in protecting the cells from oxidative stress or UV radiation.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has shown that Dyadobacter helix is closely related to other members of the genus Dyadobacter, which are commonly found in soil and freshwater environments.\n\nThe ecological roles and potential applications of Dyadobacter helix are still under investigation, but as a member of the Bacteroidetes phylum, it may participate in the decomposition of organic matter and the cycling of nutrients in the environment.",
