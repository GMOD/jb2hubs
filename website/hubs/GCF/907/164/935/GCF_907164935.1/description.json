  "description": "Osmia bicornis bicornis, also known as the Red Mason Bee or the European Orchard Bee, is a species of solitary bee belonging to the family Megachilidae. It is a subspecies of Osmia bicornis, which is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia.\n\nOsmia bicornis bicornis is a medium-sized bee, typically measuring between 10-12 millimeters in length. The species is characterized by its distinctive red-brown coloration, with a dense covering of reddish-brown hairs on its body. The female bees have two small horn-like structures on their heads, which give the species its common name \"Red Mason Bee.\"\n\nThese bees are primarily found in temperate regions, where they play a crucial role in the pollination of various flowering plants, including fruit trees, vegetables, and ornamental flowers. They are known for their solitary nesting behavior, constructing their nests in pre-existing cavities, such as crevices in walls, holes in wood, or even in the abandoned nests of other insects.\n\nOsmia bicornis bicornis is considered an important pollinator, and its conservation is of great importance for maintaining healthy ecosystems and promoting sustainable agriculture. Understanding the biology, ecology, and behavior of this species can contribute to the development of effective management strategies for its protection and promotion as a valuable pollinator.",
