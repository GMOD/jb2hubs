  "description": "Cervus elaphus, commonly known as the red deer, is a large species of deer native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the order Artiodactyla and the family Cervidae.\n\nThe red deer is a sizable, hoofed mammal characterized by its distinctive antlers, which are shed and regrown annually. Adult males, or stags, can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters at the shoulder and weigh between 150 to 300 kilograms. Females, or hinds, are generally smaller, standing around 1.2 meters tall and weighing 100 to 250 kilograms.\n\nThe species is known for its reddish-brown coat, which can vary in color depending on the season and geographic location. Red deer have well-developed senses of hearing and smell, which they rely on for predator detection and navigation through their natural habitats.\n\nCervus elaphus is typically found in temperate and boreal forests, as well as open grasslands and mountainous regions. The species is an important part of the ecosystem, serving as both a grazer and a prey species for larger carnivores. Conservation efforts have been implemented in many regions to manage and protect red deer populations.",
