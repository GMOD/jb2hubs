  "description": "Cupriavidus respiraculi is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Betaproteobacteria class. It is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and strictly aerobic bacterium. C. respiraculi is capable of respiratory metabolism, utilizing oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor during cellular respiration.\n\nThis species was originally isolated from a water sample collected from a biofilm in a drinking water distribution system. It is known to be able to grow at temperatures ranging from 20°C to 37°C, with an optimal growth temperature around 30°C.\n\nPhylogenetically, C. respiraculi is closely related to other species within the Cupriavidus genus, which are known for their ability to thrive in metal-rich environments and their potential applications in bioremediation. The exact ecological role and metabolic capabilities of C. respiraculi are still under investigation, but its presence in drinking water systems suggests it may play a role in water quality and treatment processes.",
