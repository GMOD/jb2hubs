  "description": "Malus sylvestris, commonly known as the European crab apple or wild apple, is a species of small deciduous tree native to Europe and Western Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family, which includes other fruit-bearing trees such as apples, pears, and cherries.\n\nThe European crab apple is a small, slow-growing tree that typically reaches a height of 5-12 meters. It has a rounded, spreading crown and grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are oval-shaped, green in color, and have serrated margins. The tree produces fragrant, white or pink flowers in the spring, which develop into small, spherical fruits known as crab apples.\n\nThe crab apples are typically less than 5 cm in diameter and have a tart, astringent flavor. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, making them useful for culinary and medicinal purposes. The fruits are commonly used in jams, jellies, and ciders, and the wood of the tree is sometimes used for carving and furniture-making.\n\nMalus sylvestris is an important component of many European forest ecosystems, providing food and habitat for a variety of wildlife species. It is considered a valuable genetic resource for apple breeding and conservation efforts, as it is a close relative of the domesticated apple (Malus domestica).",
