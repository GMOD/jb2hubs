  "description": "Dialister succinatiphilus is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile bacteria. It was first isolated from human fecal samples and belongs to the genus Dialister, which is part of the phylum Firmicutes and the class Negativicutes.\n\nThe cells of D. succinatiphilus are typically coccoid or slightly elongated in shape, with a diameter ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 micrometers. They are obligate anaerobes, meaning they can only grow and thrive in the absence of oxygen.\n\nBiochemical analysis has shown that D. succinatiphilus can utilize a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as carbon and energy sources. The end products of its fermentative metabolism include succinate, acetate, and hydrogen.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences has revealed that D. succinatiphilus is closely related to other Dialister species, such as Dialister invisus and Dialister pneumosintes, which are also commonly found in the human gut microbiome.\n\nThe ecological role and potential clinical significance of D. succinatiphilus in the human gut are still under investigation, as more research is needed to understand its interactions with other gut microbiota and its potential contributions to human health or disease.",
