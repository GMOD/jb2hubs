  "description": "Patella vulgata, commonly known as the common limpet, is a species of small marine gastropod mollusk in the family Patellidae. It is a type of limpet found along the rocky shores of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, including the coasts of Europe and North Africa.\n\nPatella vulgata has a conical shell that is typically gray, brown, or black in color. The shell is made of calcium carbonate and is cone-shaped, with a rounded apex. The underside of the shell is adapted for clinging tightly to rocky surfaces, allowing the limpet to withstand the strong wave action of its coastal habitat.\n\nLimpets are herbivorous, feeding primarily on algae and other microorganisms that grow on the rocks. They use their radula, a ribbon-like tongue-like structure, to scrape and graze on these food sources. Patella vulgata is an important part of the intertidal ecosystem, contributing to the overall biodiversity and functioning of the rocky shore community.\n\nReproduction in Patella vulgata involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization occurs. The resulting larvae undergo a free-swimming planktonic stage before settling and metamorphosing into the adult limpet form. The common limpet is a relatively long-lived species, with some individuals capable of living for more than a decade.",
