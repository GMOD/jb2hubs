  "description": "Nematostella vectensis, commonly known as the starlet sea anemone, is a small marine invertebrate species belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, and order Actiniaria. It is a sedentary, benthic organism that lives in coastal salt marshes, estuaries, and tidal pools.\n\nNematostella vectensis is a small, elongated anemone, typically measuring around 1-2 centimeters in length when fully extended. It has a cylindrical body with a basal disc that anchors it to the substrate and a crown of tentacles surrounding the mouth. The tentacles are used for prey capture and locomotion, and they are equipped with specialized stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are used for defense and prey capture.\n\nThis species is known for its remarkable regenerative abilities, as it can readily regenerate lost body parts, including the entire body from a small fragment. Nematostella vectensis has a relatively simple nervous system and a compact genome, making it a popular model organism for studies in developmental biology, regeneration, and evolutionary ecology.\n\nDue to its adaptability to a wide range of salinities and tolerance to environmental stressors, Nematostella vectensis has become a valuable model organism for understanding the physiological responses of marine invertebrates to various environmental conditions, including climate change and pollution.",
