It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.\n\nMercurialis annua is a small, erect plant that typically grows between 10 to 50 cm in height. The leaves are simple, oblong-lanceolate in shape, and have serrated margins. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate individuals.\n\nThe male flowers are small, green, and borne in clusters, while the female flowers are solitary and situated in the leaf axils. The fruit is a small, two-lobed capsule containing two seeds.\n\nMercurialis annua is commonly found in disturbed habitats, such as cultivated fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It is considered a weed in many regions and can be a persistent and competitive species in agricultural settings.\n\nThe plant contains various secondary metabolites, including alkaloids and terpenoids, which can have biological and ecological significance, such as defense against herbivores and interactions with other organisms.",
