  "description": "Anaerocaecibacter muris is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative bacteria that was isolated from the caecum of mice. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and the class Bacteroidia.\n\nSome key characteristics of Anaerocaecibacter muris:\n\n1. Morphology: Cells are rod-shaped, approximately 0.5-0.8 μm wide and 1.0-3.0 μm long.\n\n2. Growth requirements: Anaerocaecibacter muris is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It requires complex growth media for cultivation.\n\n3. Metabolism: It is a fermentative bacterium, capable of utilizing a variety of carbohydrates as energy sources, such as glucose, fructose, and xylose.\n\n4. Phylogenetic placement: Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicates that Anaerocaecibacter muris is closely related to other members of the family Porphyromonadaceae within the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n\n5. Ecological niche: Anaerocaecibacter muris is found as a member of the gut microbiome of mice, where it likely plays a role in the digestion and fermentation of dietary components.\n\n6. Significance: As a mouse gut commensal, Anaerocaecibacter muris may have implications for understanding the interactions between the host and its gut microbiome, which can influence various aspects of host physiology and health.",
