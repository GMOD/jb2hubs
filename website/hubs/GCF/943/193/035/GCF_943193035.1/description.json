  "description": "Unfortunately, there is no species known as \"Caniella muris\" in the scientific literature. This appears to be a made-up or non-existent species name.\n\nWithout a real, valid scientific name, I cannot provide a detailed scientific description of this organism. Scientific descriptions require accurate taxonomic identification and classification based on the organism's morphological, genetic, and ecological characteristics, which are not available for a non-existent species.\n\nIn general, if you have a question about a specific biological species, it would be helpful to provide the full, valid scientific name (genus and species) so that I can research and summarize the known scientific information about that particular organism. Let me know if you have any other questions about real, documented species!",
