  "description": "Adlercreutzia agrestimuris is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Firmicutes phylum. It is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from the feces of a wild mouse. The species was first described in 2016 and named after the Finnish microbiologist Ingvar Adlercreutz, who made significant contributions to the study of gut microbiome.\n\nAdlercreutzia agrestimuris is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, including glucose, fructose, and xylose, to produce short-chain fatty acids as end products. It is found as a member of the gut microbiome of certain rodent species and may play a role in the digestion and metabolism of dietary components within the host's intestinal tract. Further research is needed to fully understand the ecological niche and potential functional significance of this bacterial species within the complex gut microbial communities of its natural hosts.",
