  "description": "Alistipes muris is a species of anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterium. It was first isolated from the fecal samples of laboratory mice.\n\nSome key characteristics of Alistipes muris:\n\n1. Taxonomy: Alistipes muris belongs to the genus Alistipes, which is part of the phylum Bacteroidetes.\n\n2. Morphology: The cells are typically 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.0-2.0 μm in length, occurring singly or in pairs.\n\n3. Growth requirements: Alistipes muris is an obligate anaerobe, meaning it can only grow in the absence of oxygen. It requires complex growth media for cultivation.\n\n4. Biochemical properties: The bacterium is asaccharolytic, meaning it cannot ferment carbohydrates. It is catalase-negative and oxidase-positive.\n\n5. Habitat and distribution: Alistipes muris is a member of the gut microbiome of laboratory mice and has been isolated from their fecal samples. It is believed to be part of the normal gut flora in these rodents.\n\n6. Significance: As a commensal bacterium in mice, Alistipes muris may play a role in the overall gut microbial community and potentially contribute to the health and physiology of the host. Further research is needed to elucidate its specific functions and interactions within the mouse gut ecosystem.",
