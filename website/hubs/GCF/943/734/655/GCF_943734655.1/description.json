  "description": "Sabethes cyaneus, commonly known as the blue mosquito, is a species of mosquito belonging to the genus Sabethes. It is native to Central and South America, where it can be found in tropical and subtropical regions.\n\nSabethes cyaneus is a medium-sized mosquito, with a distinct metallic blue or green coloration on its body and legs. This coloration is due to the presence of specialized scales on its body, which reflect light and give the mosquito its striking appearance.\n\nThe mosquito is known to be an efficient vector for the transmission of certain arboviruses, including yellow fever and Oropouche virus. It primarily feeds on birds, but may also occasionally bite humans.\n\nSabethes cyaneus is typically found in forested areas, where it breeds in tree holes, leaf axils, and other natural water-holding containers. The females lay their eggs in these water-filled habitats, and the larvae develop and mature into adult mosquitoes.\n\nThis species is of interest to researchers and public health professionals due to its potential role in the transmission of important infectious diseases in its native range.",
