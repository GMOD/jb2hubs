  "description": "Anopheles gambiae is a species of mosquito that is the primary vector for the transmission of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a member of the Anopheles gambiae complex, which includes several closely related mosquito species.\n\nAnopheles gambiae is a small, slender mosquito with a distinct speckled appearance on its wings. It has a dark proboscis and palps, and its legs are also dark in color. The species is highly anthropophilic, meaning it prefers to feed on human hosts, which contributes to its role as a major malaria vector.\n\nThese mosquitoes typically breed in small, temporary bodies of water, such as puddles, rain-filled ditches, and artificial containers. The larvae are aquatic and feed on microorganisms in the water. The adult females require a blood meal to produce eggs, and they often seek out human hosts at night.\n\nAnopheles gambiae is known for its high vectorial capacity, which means it is highly efficient at transmitting the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. The species is widely distributed across Sub-Saharan Africa and is responsible for a significant burden of malaria in the region, making it a major public health concern.",
