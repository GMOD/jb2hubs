  "description": "Episyrphus balteatus, commonly known as the marmalade hoverfly, is a species of hoverfly that belongs to the family Syrphidae. It is a widespread and common species found throughout Europe, Asia, and North Africa.\n\nEpisyrphus balteatus is a medium-sized hoverfly, typically measuring between 10-14 millimeters in length. The adult fly has a distinct black and yellow banded abdomen, giving it a \"marmalade\" appearance. The thorax is mostly black, and the legs are yellow or orange-yellow in color.\n\nThese hoverflies are important pollinators, feeding on the nectar and pollen of a wide variety of flowering plants. Their larvae, known as \"aphid lions,\" are voracious predators, feeding on various species of aphids, which makes them beneficial insects in agricultural and horticultural settings.\n\nEpisyrphus balteatus is considered a useful biological control agent, as its larvae can help in the natural regulation of aphid populations. The species has a high adaptability to different habitats and can thrive in both natural and managed ecosystems, contributing to the overall biodiversity and ecosystem services.",
