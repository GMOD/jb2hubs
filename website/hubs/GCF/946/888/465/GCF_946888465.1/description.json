  "description": "Apilactobacillus apinorum is a species of lactic acid bacteria that was isolated from the honey crop of honeybees (Apis spp.). It is a Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium. Cells of A. apinorum are typically rod-shaped and occur singly or in pairs.\n\nThis species is capable of fermenting various carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, to produce lactic acid as the primary end-product of their metabolism. A. apinorum is considered an important member of the honeybee gut microbiome, where it likely plays a role in the digestion and preservation of nectar and pollen consumed by the bees.\n\nPhylogenetically, A. apinorum belongs to the genus Apilactobacillus, which was recently separated from the genus Lactobacillus based on genomic and phenotypic differences. The species name \"apinorum\" refers to its isolation from the honey crop of Apis (honeybee) species.",
