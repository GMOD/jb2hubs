  "description": "Saccharomyces kudriavzevii IFO 1802 is a species of yeast that belongs to the genus Saccharomyces. It is a haploid, ascomycete fungus that reproduces through budding.\n\nSaccharomyces kudriavzevii IFO 1802 is a cryotolerant yeast, meaning it is able to grow and thrive at lower temperatures compared to other Saccharomyces species. This characteristic makes it particularly useful in the production of fermented beverages, such as wine and beer, where lower fermentation temperatures are desirable.\n\nThe genome of Saccharomyces kudriavzevii IFO 1802 has been sequenced and studied, revealing insights into its evolutionary relationship with other Saccharomyces species. It is believed to have diverged from the more well-known Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) several million years ago.\n\nIn terms of its physiological and biochemical properties, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii IFO 1802 is known to produce a unique set of volatile compounds during fermentation, which can contribute to the aroma and flavor profiles of the resulting beverages. It has also been studied for its potential applications in the production of biofuels and other biotechnological processes.",
