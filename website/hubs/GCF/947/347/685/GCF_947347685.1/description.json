  "description": "Pleuronectes platessa, commonly known as the European plaice, is a species of flatfish native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea. It belongs to the family Pleuronectidae, which includes various species of righteye flounders.\n\nThe European plaice is a benthic fish, meaning it lives and feeds on the seafloor. It has a distinctive, flattened, oval-shaped body with both eyes positioned on the right side of its head. The coloration of the upper side (the side with the eyes) is typically brownish-olive with distinctive orange-red spots, while the underside is white.\n\nPlaice are known for their ability to camouflage themselves by burying in the seabed, with only their eyes protruding, making them well-adapted to their bottom-dwelling lifestyle. They feed primarily on small invertebrates, such as bivalves, crustaceans, and polychaete worms, which they locate using their sensitive olfactory and tactile senses.\n\nPleuronectes platessa is an economically important species, as it is a popular target for commercial and recreational fisheries in the North Atlantic region. Its population status and management are closely monitored by fisheries management authorities to ensure the sustainability of this valuable marine resource.",
