  "description": "Balaenoptera acutorostrata, commonly known as the common minke whale or Northern minke whale, is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family Balaenopteridae. It is the smallest of the rorqual whales, typically measuring between 7 to 10 meters in length.\n\nThe key features of Balaenoptera acutorostrata include:\n\n1. Morphology: Streamlined body with a pointed, acutely-shaped rostrum (snout), which is the distinctive feature that gives the species its name. It has a smooth, dark gray to black coloration on the dorsal (upper) side and a lighter, often white, ventral (lower) side.\n\n2. Feeding Behavior: A filter-feeding whale, it uses its baleen plates (made of keratin) to strain small schooling fish, krill, and other small marine organisms from the water.\n\n3. Distribution and Habitat: Found in temperate and polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. It typically inhabits coastal and offshore waters.\n\n4. Conservation Status: Classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, the common minke whale is one of the most abundant baleen whale species, with a global population estimated to be around 500,000 individuals.\n\n5. Reproduction and Life History: Females typically give birth to a single calf every 1-2 years after a gestation period of around 10 months. Minke whales can live up to 50 years in the wild.\n\nThis species is an important component of marine ecosystems and plays a role in the overall health and balance of the oceanic food web.",
