  "description": "Candidatus Ornithobacterium hominis is a recently discovered and proposed bacterial species that was isolated from human fecal samples. It belongs to the phylum Bacteroidetes and is classified as a member of the Ornithobacterium genus.\n\nThe bacterium is considered a candidate species (denoted by the prefix \"Candidatus\") because it has not yet been formally described and named according to the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. It is referred to as \"Ornithobacterium hominis\" based on its presumed relationship to the Ornithobacterium genus and its isolation from the human (hominis) gut microbiome.\n\nCandidatus Ornithobacterium hominis is an obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming, and non-motile bacterium. It is thought to play a role in the human gut ecosystem, but its specific functions and interactions within the microbiome are still under investigation. Further research is needed to fully characterize this newly identified bacterial species and understand its potential significance in human health and disease.",
