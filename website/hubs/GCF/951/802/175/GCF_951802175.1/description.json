  "description": "Populus nigra, commonly known as the black poplar or European black poplar, is a deciduous tree species belonging to the genus Populus, which is part of the willow family (Salicaceae). It is native to large parts of Europe and western and central Asia.\n\nThe black poplar is a tall, fast-growing tree that can reach heights of up to 30-40 meters (100-130 feet). Its trunk can grow to a diameter of up to 2 meters (6.5 feet). The bark is dark, fissured, and scaly, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. The leaves are triangular or deltoid in shape, with serrated edges, and turn yellow in autumn before falling.\n\nPopulus nigra is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are borne on separate trees. The flowers are small and appear in catkins before the leaves emerge in early spring. The tree produces large quantities of small, wind-dispersed seeds that are surrounded by cottony tufts, allowing for efficient wind-based seed dispersal.\n\nThe black poplar is an important species in its native range, providing timber, firewood, and shelter for wildlife. It is also cultivated as an ornamental and shade tree in parks and gardens. Due to habitat loss and competition from invasive species, the conservation status of Populus nigra is considered to be of Least Concern globally, though some regional populations may be more threatened.",
