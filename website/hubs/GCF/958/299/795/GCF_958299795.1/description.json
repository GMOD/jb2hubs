  "description": "Porites lutea is a species of reef-building coral that belongs to the family Poritidae. It is commonly known as the Lobe Coral or Yellow Porites Coral.\n\nPorites lutea is a colonial coral, meaning it is composed of numerous individual polyps that are interconnected and share a common skeleton. The coral colony typically forms massive, rounded or lobe-shaped structures, with a yellowish-brown or beige coloration.\n\nThe individual polyps of Porites lutea are small, usually less than 2 millimeters in diameter, and have six or more tentacles. The coral's skeleton is composed of calcium carbonate, which is secreted by the polyps and forms the structural foundation of the colony.\n\nPorites lutea is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific region, ranging from the Red Sea and East Africa to the central Pacific Ocean. It is a common and ecologically important species, often forming a significant component of coral reef ecosystems in shallow, tropical marine environments.\n\nThis species of coral is known for its tolerance to a wide range of environmental conditions, including temperature fluctuations, sedimentation, and turbidity. However, like many other coral species, Porites lutea is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as ocean warming and acidification, which can lead to coral bleaching and increased mortality.",
