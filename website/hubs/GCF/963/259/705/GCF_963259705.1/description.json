  "description": "Myotis daubentonii, commonly known as the Daubenton's bat or the water bat, is a species of small insectivorous bat belonging to the genus Myotis. It is a member of the family Vespertilionidae, which includes the most common and widespread bats in the world.\n\nMyotis daubentonii is a medium-sized bat, with a body length of approximately 4.5-5.5 inches (11-14 cm) and a wingspan of 9-11 inches (23-28 cm). The species is characterized by its dark brown or greyish-brown fur on the back and lighter, greyish-white fur on the underside. The bat has large, rounded ears and a distinctive keel on the tail membrane, which helps it maneuver efficiently while hunting for prey over water.\n\nThis species is widely distributed across Europe and parts of Asia, inhabiting a variety of habitats, including forests, parks, and urban areas. Daubenton's bats are closely associated with water sources, where they feed primarily on aquatic insects, such as midges, caddisflies, and small fish. They use their large hind feet and tail membrane to skim the water's surface, capturing their prey with remarkable precision.\n\nDaubenton's bats are known for their adaptations to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, including their ability to dive into the water to catch prey and their specialized echolocation calls, which allow them to navigate and hunt effectively over water. They typically roost in caves, abandoned buildings, and tree cavities, and may form large colonies during the breeding season.",
