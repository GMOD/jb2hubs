  "description": "Globicephala melas, also known as the long-finned pilot whale, is a species of cetacean in the dolphin family Delphinidae. It is one of the larger members of the dolphin family, with an average length of 5.5 meters (18 feet) for males and 4.7 meters (15 feet) for females.\n\nThe long-finned pilot whale has a robust, stocky body with a rounded, bulbous head and a short, indistinct beak. Its coloration is dark gray to black on the upper body, with a lighter gray or white underside. The species is characterized by its long, paddle-shaped flippers, which can reach up to one-quarter of the whale's body length.\n\nPilot whales are highly social animals, living in tightly-knit, matrilineal pods of up to 50 individuals. They are known for their strong social bonds and complex communication behaviors. They primarily feed on squid and small fish, using their sharp teeth and suction feeding techniques to capture their prey.\n\nThe long-finned pilot whale is found in temperate and subpolar waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. They are considered to be a species of least concern by the IUCN, although they may be vulnerable to threats such as bycatch, pollution, and climate change.",
