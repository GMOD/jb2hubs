  "description": "Cydia fagiglandana is a species of moth belonging to the family Tortricidae, commonly known as the beech nut moth. It is a small, grayish-brown moth with distinctive wing patterns. The larvae of Cydia fagiglandana feed exclusively on the nuts or mast of European beech trees (Fagus sylvatica).\n\nThe adult moths have a wingspan of around 12-15 millimeters and their forewings are grayish-brown with dark brown and black markings, often forming a distinctive \"V\" shape. The hindwings are a paler gray. The larvae are small, whitish-yellow caterpillars that burrow into the developing beech nuts, feeding on the nutmeat inside.\n\nCydia fagiglandana is found across Europe, from the United Kingdom and Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean region in the south. It plays an important ecological role in the natural regeneration of beech forests, as the larvae help to thin out the beech nut crop, allowing for better development of the remaining nuts and improved germination rates. However, high populations of the moth can sometimes damage commercial beech nut harvests.",
