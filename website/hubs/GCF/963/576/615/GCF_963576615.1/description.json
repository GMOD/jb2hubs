  "description": "Watersipora subatra is a species of marine bryozoan, a small invertebrate animal that lives in colonies attached to various underwater surfaces. It is commonly known as the brown encrusting bryozoan.\n\nWatersipora subatra typically forms encrusting colonies, growing as a thin layer on rocks, shells, or other hard substrates in coastal marine environments. The colonies are brownish or blackish in color, giving rise to the common name \"brown encrusting bryozoan.\"\n\nEach individual within the colony, called a zooid, is small, typically measuring around 0.5-1 millimeters in length. The zooids have a lophophore, a ring of tentacles used for feeding, which they can retract into a protective box-like structure called an operculum when threatened.\n\nWatersipora subatra is widely distributed, found in temperate and tropical marine waters across the globe, including in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It is known to be a fouling organism, often growing on the hulls of ships and other underwater structures.\n\nAs a bryozoan, Watersipora subatra is part of a phylum of small, filter-feeding invertebrates that play important roles in marine ecosystems, contributing to the diversity and functioning of benthic communities.",
