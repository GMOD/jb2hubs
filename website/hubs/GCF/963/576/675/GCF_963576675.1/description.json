  "description": "Euphorbia lathyris, commonly known as caper spurge or gopher plant, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Euphorbia, which is part of the family Euphorbiaceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 1 meter tall.\n\nThe plant has thick, glaucous (bluish-green) leaves that are arranged in pairs and have a distinct midrib. The leaves are sessile (lacking a petiole) and have a lanceolate (lance-shaped) shape. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers that are surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves. These flowers develop into three-lobed capsules that contain small, gray-brown seeds.\n\nEuphorbia lathyris is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of western Asia. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it has been introduced. The plant contains a milky sap that is toxic and can cause skin irritation in some individuals. It has historically been used for medicinal purposes, but its use is now discouraged due to the potential health risks.",
