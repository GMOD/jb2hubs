  "description": "Cohaesibacter marisflavi is a species of bacteria that was isolated from seawater collected from the East China Sea. It belongs to the family Rhodobacteraceae within the phylum Proteobacteria.\n\nThe cells of Cohaesibacter marisflavi are Gram-negative, aerobic, and non-spore-forming. They are typically rod-shaped and exhibit a yellow pigmentation. The optimal growth conditions for this species include a temperature range of 25-30Â°C and a pH range of 7.0-8.0.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence has shown that Cohaesibacter marisflavi is closely related to other members of the genus Cohaesibacter, which are known to be found in marine environments. This genus is characterized by its ability to form aggregates or cell clusters, which is reflected in the species name \"marisflavi\" meaning \"from the sea, yellow.\"\n\nCohaesibacter marisflavi is considered a heterotrophic bacterium, meaning it requires organic carbon compounds for its energy and growth. Its exact ecological role and potential applications, if any, are still under investigation.",
