  "description": "Mytilus edulis, commonly known as the common mussel or blue mussel, is a species of marine bivalve mollusk in the family Mytilidae. It is a small- to medium-sized edible mussel, typically growing to a length of 5-10 centimeters.\n\nThe shell of Mytilus edulis is typically dark blue or black in color, with a smooth, elongated and slightly curved shape. The interior of the shell is typically white or pearly in appearance. The mussel uses its strong byssal threads to attach itself firmly to rocks, piers, and other hard substrates in the intertidal and subtidal zones.\n\nMytilus edulis is widely distributed throughout the northern Atlantic Ocean, from the Arctic Circle to the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, and from the Canadian Maritimes to the Carolinas in North America. It is an important commercial species, cultivated and harvested for human consumption in many coastal regions around the world.\n\nEcologically, Mytilus edulis plays a significant role in the marine ecosystem, serving as a food source for various predators and filter-feeding on plankton and organic matter in the water column. Its presence can also influence the diversity and structure of the associated benthic community.",
