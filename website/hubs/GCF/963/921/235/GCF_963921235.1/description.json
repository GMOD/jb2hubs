  "description": "Mobula hypostoma, commonly known as the Atlantic devil ray or lesser Guinean devil ray, is a species of ray belonging to the family Mobulidae. It is a medium-sized ray, typically measuring between 1 to 1.5 meters in wingspan.\n\nThe key distinguishing features of M. hypostoma include:\n\n1. Body shape: It has a flattened, diamond-shaped body with large, wing-like pectoral fins.\n\n2. Cephalic fins: The cephalic fins (head fins) are small and pointed, unlike the larger, more prominent cephalic fins seen in other devil ray species.\n\n3. Coloration: The dorsal (upper) side is typically dark brown or black, while the ventral (lower) side is pale or white.\n\n4. Tail: The tail is relatively short and lacks a dorsal fin.\n\nM. hypostoma is found in the western Atlantic Ocean, primarily in tropical and subtropical waters along the coast of the Americas, from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. It is a filter-feeding species, primarily consuming small schooling fishes, crustaceans, and zooplankton.\n\nThe conservation status of M. hypostoma is classified as \"Vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), primarily due to the species' susceptibility to bycatch in commercial fisheries and the potential impacts of overfishing.",
