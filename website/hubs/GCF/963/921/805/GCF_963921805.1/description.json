  "description": "Phalacrocorax carbo, commonly known as the great cormorant or black cormorant, is a large seabird species belonging to the family Phalacrocoracidae. It is a member of the cormorant genus, Phalacrocorax.\n\nDescription:\nThe great cormorant is a large, heavy-bodied bird with a long, hooked bill and webbed feet. It has a distinctive black plumage, with a green or purple iridescent sheen, and a white patch on the thigh and belly. The bill is long, slender, and sharply hooked, which is an adaptation for catching and holding slippery fish, its primary prey. The feet are large and fully webbed, allowing the bird to propel itself efficiently through the water during diving and swimming.\n\nHabitat and Distribution:\nThe great cormorant is a widely distributed species, found on coasts and inland waterways across Europe, Asia, Africa, and parts of North America. It prefers coastal and estuarine habitats, where it can forage for fish, as well as inland lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The species is known for its ability to adapt to various aquatic environments and can thrive in both marine and freshwater ecosystems.\n\nBehavior and Ecology:\nGreat cormorants are highly social birds, often found in large colonies during the breeding season. They are excellent divers, using their webbed feet and streamlined bodies to pursue and catch fish underwater. After diving, they often perch with their wings spread out, a behavior thought to help them dry their feathers and regulate their body temperature.\n\nConservation Status:\nThe great cormorant is classified as a species of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Despite some local population declines, the overall global population of the species is considered stable, with an estimated global population of over 2 million individuals.",
