  "description": "Rickettsia helvetica is a species of obligate intracellular bacteria that belongs to the genus Rickettsia, within the family Rickettsiaceae. It is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is primarily transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex.\n\nRickettsia helvetica is found primarily in Europe, particularly in Switzerland, where it was first isolated and identified in 1979. It is known to infect a variety of host organisms, including humans, where it can cause a mild form of spotted fever, also known as Rickettsia helvetica infection or Swiss Tick Typhus.\n\nThe bacterium is typically maintained in nature through a cycle involving ticks and their vertebrate hosts, such as small mammals and birds. Humans can become infected through the bite of an infected tick, although the risk of severe illness is generally lower compared to other Rickettsia species.\n\nRickettsia helvetica infection can cause a range of non-specific symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches, and sometimes a rash. Most cases are mild and self-limiting, but in some instances, more severe complications, such as meningitis or myocarditis, have been reported.\n\nDiagnosis of Rickettsia helvetica infection typically involves serological tests or molecular methods, such as PCR, to detect the presence of the bacterium or its genetic material. Treatment often involves the use of antibiotics, such as doxycycline, which are effective against Rickettsia species.",
