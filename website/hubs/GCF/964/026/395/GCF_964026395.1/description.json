  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia is a proposed species of uncultured bacterial endosymbiont found within the body of the moth Thecophora atra, also known as the black pinion moth. Endosymbionts are microorganisms that live in close association with their host organisms, often providing beneficial functions.\n\nThe Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont is classified as a member of the phylum Proteobacteria, specifically within the class Gammaproteobacteria. It is considered an uncultured species, meaning that it has not yet been successfully isolated and grown in a laboratory setting.\n\nBased on genomic analyses, the Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont is believed to play a role in the metabolism and nutrient provisioning of its host, the black pinion moth. The endosymbiont may contribute to the moth's ability to utilize specific dietary resources or provide other physiological benefits.\n\nThe presence and potential functional roles of the Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont within the black pinion moth highlight the complex and important relationships that can exist between insects and their associated microbial communities, which are an active area of research in the field of insect ecology and symbiosis.",
