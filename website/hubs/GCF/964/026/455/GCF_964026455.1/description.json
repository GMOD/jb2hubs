  "description": "Rickettsia endosymbiont of Lasioglossum villosulum is a species of intracellular bacteria that lives in a symbiotic relationship with the leafcutter bee Lasioglossum villosulum. Rickettsia are a genus of gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that are known to infect a wide range of arthropod hosts, including insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.\n\nThe Rickettsia endosymbiont of L. villosulum resides within the cells of its host, providing various benefits to the bee. This symbiotic relationship is believed to enhance the fitness and reproductive success of the leafcutter bee by potentially influencing traits such as fecundity, development, or defense against pathogens.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis has shown that the Rickettsia endosymbiont of L. villosulum is closely related to other Rickettsia species found in various insect hosts. Understanding the dynamics and interactions between this endosymbiont and its host bee species can provide insights into the evolution and ecology of symbiotic relationships in arthropods.",
