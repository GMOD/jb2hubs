  "description": "Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont of Nemotelus nigrinus is a bacterial endosymbiont that resides within the body of the insect species Nemotelus nigrinus, a type of soldier fly. Endosymbionts are microorganisms that live in close association with their host organisms, often providing beneficial functions to the host.\n\nThis particular endosymbiont belongs to the Candidatus Tisiphia genus, which is a proposed bacterial genus that has not yet been formally described and classified. The exact nature of the relationship between Candidatus Tisiphia and its Nemotelus nigrinus host is not fully understood, but endosymbionts often play important roles in the physiology, nutrition, or defense of their insect hosts.\n\nNemotelus nigrinus is a species of soldier fly, which are small, stout-bodied flies that are often found near aquatic habitats. The presence of the Candidatus Tisiphia endosymbiont within this insect species suggests a potentially mutualistic or symbiotic relationship that may be important for the host's survival and ecological function.",
