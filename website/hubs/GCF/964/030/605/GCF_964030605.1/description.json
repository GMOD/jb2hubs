  "description": "Acropora palmata, commonly known as the elkhorn coral, is a species of coral found in the Caribbean Sea and the western Atlantic Ocean. It is a significant reef-building coral and a crucial component of the Caribbean coral reef ecosystem.\n\nAcropora palmata is a branching coral, with large, thick, and flattened branches that resemble the antlers of an elk, hence the common name. The coral's branches can grow up to 2 meters (6.6 feet) in length and form dense, intricate structures on the reef. The coral's surface is covered with small, closely spaced calices (the individual cup-like structures that house the coral polyps).\n\nThis species is a zooxanthellate coral, meaning it has a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae that live within the coral's tissues. The zooxanthellae provide the coral with nutrients through photosynthesis, while the coral provides the algae with a protected environment and access to sunlight.\n\nAcropora palmata is an important habitat-forming species, providing shelter and food for a diverse array of marine life, including fish, invertebrates, and other coral species. However, the elkhorn coral has experienced significant population declines in recent decades due to various threats, such as disease outbreaks, bleaching events, and physical damage from storms and human activities. As a result, it is listed as a Critically Endangered species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.",
