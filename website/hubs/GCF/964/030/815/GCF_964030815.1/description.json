  "description": "Rickettsia endosymbiont of Seladonia tumulorum is a species of intracellular bacteria that resides within the cells of the bee species Seladonia tumulorum, also known as the Tumulorum mining bee. This Rickettsia endosymbiont is a member of the genus Rickettsia, which are a group of obligate intracellular bacteria that are commonly found in arthropod hosts, such as ticks, mites, and insects.\n\nThe Rickettsia endosymbiont of Seladonia tumulorum is believed to have a mutualistic relationship with its host, where the bacteria provide some beneficial function to the bee, potentially assisting in its metabolism, immune system, or other physiological processes. The bacteria are vertically transmitted from the female bee to her offspring, ensuring their continued presence within the host population.\n\nPhylogenetic and genomic analyses have shown that this Rickettsia endosymbiont is closely related to other Rickettsia species found in various arthropod hosts, but it also exhibits unique genetic and functional characteristics that differentiate it from its close relatives. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific role and interactions of this endosymbiont within the Seladonia tumulorum host.",
