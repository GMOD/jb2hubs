  "description": "Alphaproteobacteria bacterium endosymbiont of Tiliacea citrago is a species of bacteria that exists in a symbiotic relationship with the Tiliacea citrago, a type of moth.\n\nAlphaproteobacteria are a class of proteobacteria, a phylum of gram-negative bacteria. This specific bacterium is an endosymbiont, meaning it lives inside the cells of the Tiliacea citrago moth.\n\nThe Tiliacea citrago, also known as the lime hawk-moth, is a species of moth in the family Sphingidae. The symbiotic relationship between the Alphaproteobacteria bacterium and the Tiliacea citrago is considered an example of endosymbiosis, where the bacterium resides within the cells of the moth and provides some benefit to its host.\n\nThe exact nature of the symbiotic relationship and the specific functions or benefits the bacterium provides to the Tiliacea citrago are not yet fully understood and may be an area of ongoing research.",
