  "description": "Larus michahellis, commonly known as the yellow-legged gull, is a species of gull that belongs to the family Laridae. It is a medium-sized gull with distinctive features that distinguish it from other gull species.\n\nThe yellow-legged gull is characterized by its large size, with a body length ranging from 50 to 65 centimeters and a wingspan of approximately 125 to 155 centimeters. The adult birds have a distinctive yellow bill and legs, as well as a white head, neck, underparts, and tail. The back and upper wings are a light gray color, and the tips of the wings are black with white spots.\n\nThis species is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region, including the coasts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is a coastal species, typically found in areas with access to a reliable food source, such as fishing harbors, landfills, and beaches.\n\nThe yellow-legged gull is an opportunistic feeder, consuming a variety of prey, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and even small rodents or birds. It is known for its adaptability and ability to thrive in urban environments, often scavenging for food in human-dominated areas.\n\nLarus michahellis is an important component of the coastal ecosystems in which it resides, playing a role in the food web and contributing to the overall biodiversity of the region. However, like many gull species, it can sometimes be considered a nuisance due to its tendency to scavenge for food in urban areas and potentially compete with other wildlife for resources.",
