  "description": "Diadema setosum, commonly known as the black sea urchin or long-spined sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the phylum Echinodermata and the class Echinoidea.\n\nThe body of Diadema setosum is spherical and covered with long, thin, and sharp black spines that can reach up to 30 cm in length. These spines are used for defense against predators and for locomotion. The body diameter of an adult Diadema setosum typically ranges from 5 to 15 cm.\n\nDiadema setosum is a grazing herbivore, feeding on a variety of algae and other plant material found in its habitat. It is an important component of coral reef ecosystems, where it helps to maintain the balance between algae and corals.\n\nReproduction in Diadema setosum involves the release of sperm and eggs into the water column, where fertilization takes place. The resulting larvae undergo a pelagic larval stage before settling and metamorphosing into the adult form.\n\nDiadema setosum is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, including the Red Sea, the western Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is commonly found in shallow reef environments, typically at depths ranging from a few meters to 30 meters.",
