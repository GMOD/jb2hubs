  "description": "Antedon mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean feather star, is a species of crinoid echinoderm found in the Mediterranean Sea and adjacent Atlantic waters. It is a member of the family Antedonidae.\n\nThe Antedon mediterranea is a sessile, suspension-feeding marine invertebrate that lives attached to rocky substrates or other surfaces in shallow waters. It has a central disc from which radiate up to 10 feather-like arms, each with multiple pinnules or branches. The arms can be up to 15 cm in length and are used to capture plankton and other small particles from the surrounding water.\n\nThe body of the Antedon mediterranea is typically reddish-brown or orange in color, though color variations do occur. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the ability to regenerate lost arms or other body parts. The species is an important component of Mediterranean benthic ecosystems, serving as prey for various predators and providing habitat and food sources for other marine organisms.",
