  "description": "Avibacterium endocarditidis is a species of bacterium that belongs to the genus Avibacterium. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile, and facultatively anaerobic bacterium.\n\nAvibacterium endocarditidis was initially isolated from the heart valves of birds with infective endocarditis, a serious condition characterized by the inflammation of the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). The species is primarily associated with causing endocarditis in avian species, particularly in domestic poultry and wild birds.\n\nGenetically, Avibacterium endocarditidis is closely related to other Avibacterium species, but it can be distinguished from them based on its unique phenotypic and biochemical characteristics, as well as its distinct 16S rRNA gene sequence.\n\nThe bacterium is considered an important pathogen in the veterinary field, as it can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in affected bird populations. Understanding the biology and virulence factors of Avibacterium endocarditidis is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies for avian infective endocarditis.",
