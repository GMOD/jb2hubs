  "description": "Bordetella tumbae is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus Bordetella. It is a gram-negative, aerobic, and rod-shaped bacterium. Bordetella tumbae was first isolated from the gut microbiome of the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus), a critically endangered primate species found in the forests of Madagascar.\n\nThe genome of Bordetella tumbae has been sequenced, and it reveals that the bacterium is closely related to other Bordetella species, such as Bordetella pertussis, which is the causative agent of whooping cough. However, Bordetella tumbae is not known to be a human pathogen, and its specific ecological roles and interactions within the gut microbiome of the greater bamboo lemur are still under investigation.\n\nFurther research is needed to understand the unique adaptations and functions of Bordetella tumbae within the gut of its host species, as well as its potential implications for the conservation and management of the greater bamboo lemur and its ecosystem.",
