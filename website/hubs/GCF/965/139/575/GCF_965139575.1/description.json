  "description": "Comamonas aquatilis is a species of bacteria that belongs to the Comamonadaceae family. It is a Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, and motile bacterium. Comamonas aquatilis is found in aquatic environments, such as freshwater and wastewater treatment systems.\n\nThe cells of Comamonas aquatilis are typically rod-shaped and measure approximately 0.5-0.8 μm in width and 1.2-2.0 μm in length. They possess a single polar flagellum, which enables their motility. Comamonas aquatilis is considered an aerobic bacterium, meaning it requires oxygen for its growth and metabolism.\n\nBiochemically, Comamonas aquatilis is known to be capable of oxidizing a variety of organic compounds, including carbohydrates, alcohols, and organic acids. This metabolic versatility allows the bacterium to adapt to different environmental conditions and play a role in the cycling of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.\n\nComamonas aquatilis has been isolated from various water sources, including rivers, lakes, and wastewater treatment plants, and has been studied for its potential applications in bioremediation and wastewater treatment processes.",
