    <H3>Unavailable tracks</H3>
    <P>
      This is a list of files that are available at UCSC, but which we were not
      able to ping. See <StyledLink href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/">
        https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/
      </StyledLink> for more info. Most of these fall under this restriction category:
      "Certain genome annotation data, mostly on the human genome and in the domain
      of clinical genetics, have specific restrictions. For some of these, we are
      not allowed to make the data available. Usually the data must be obtained from
      the source database directly in the original format or licensed, rather from
      UCSC. Examples are HGMD, LOVD, OMIM, Decipher, Genomenon, Genehancer and COSMIC."
      These generally have re-sharing restrictions and are (currently) unavailable
      in JBrowse, though we may be able to load them. Please get in touch if you
      are interested in seeing them
